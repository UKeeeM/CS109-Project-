Ancient Egyptians are liberally biased.  Otherwise they would have written it in English like Jesus did!

Wouldn't the pyramids be remarkably bad grain storage structures what with the being mostly solid stone bricks?
But everyone knows that Forbes is part of the liberal, lame stream media. The only reliable source is the bible, just ask Ben.
It terrifies me that this man holds a medical license. 

Well, unless he's lying about that, too.

Uh, no. God put those hieroglyphics there to trick us into not believing.

What kind of people do we let become *brain surgeons*, let alone presidents....
I feel like I'm slipped into some sort of alternate universe this man is so stupid yet running for the highest office in the land.    Who are this man's supporters?    I grew up in amongst some of the most fundamentalist religionists the world has ever known and I not a single one that would say this.   He simply has to be pulling a performance art piece on all of us, there is no other logical explanation.
So good to know. He is the best ex president ever.
It's sad he gets the treatment he does and another Bush is running for president despite everything they have done is somehow considered ok.  
Thank god.
Best wishes
Good for him. 
I wasn't aware that we didn't already consider it a social good. I mean, unless you are a religious busy body, why wouldn't it be considered good if that is what the woman wants?
I struggle with this attitude.  Clearly there is a point in the development of an embryo where there's no nervous system, and the zygote is barely a few thousand cells.  But beyond that, when the brain and heart start to form, there's no doubting we're talking about a living human being, albeit one completely incapable of surviving outside of the uterus for very many months to come.  

These rabid antiabortionists have some really messed up ideas on telling a woman what to do with her own body, and downright illogical and inhuman attitudes on how women who are not ready to have a child should be treated.  But people who get multiple abortions really need to stop using them as if they're just another form of contraception - even if it's just for their own health.  It really isn't a good idea to repeatedly put your body through such rigours.

'This is not the right time for me' should be reason enough to have ONE abortion.  But demanding the right to abort on-demand, with no limit on how many abortions you can expect to have, is no different from demanding the right to be irresponsible, and dressing it up in the language of 'women's rights' - which were hard enough to win in the first place - as if you have some overarching right to ignore basic matters of fact just because you can't keep your legs shut.

If you don't want to get pregnant, but don't want to use contraception, it seems to me like you just want your cake and eat it, and the real world doesn't work like that.  Have some personal responsibility.  Sex is great.  Have lots of it.  But don't make out like you're no longer bound to the realities of human reproduction, just because you have a busy schedule.
Abortions aren't good though, it's just good that they're available if all other options have failed.
As an avid pro life blue blooded gay liberal.  
Saying "Abortion is Great" in a not ironic way... Does not work.  
It is one of the hardest decisions a woman will ever have to make, and it really should not be considered "Great" or "evil". Just... A thing.
Abortion can be a better alternative but great? Wow.  
   
A related thought, when assisted suicide finally becomes a mainstream idea do you think it will influence public opinion on abortion to any significant degree?
"This is not the right time for me"....  go to the gahdamn pharmacy and get some prophylactics or keep your pants on.
What the actual fuck?  Fucking on the many options of birth control is great.  Getting permanently sterilized if you don't want kids is great.  Using abortion as your method of birth control is NOT GREAT.  

With all the free and low cost options for birth control in 2015.... the need for abortions should be almost unheard of.  And frankly there are a lot of other sex options that have zero risk of pregnancy... lots of holes and such.  Outer-course.  Handies. 

Dems are dead wrong on this issue.  Killing unborn babies should not be simply for convenience or because someone was too lazy to practice safe sex.   Honestly, I wish they were all illegal except for Rape, Incest, and true health concerns.   

Quit watching Melissa Harris-Perry when she said something truly ignorant like "We should ignore science on this issue.  A baby is only a baby when the parents want it to be"........ oh really Melissa?  So now we are going to be the party that ignores science if we don't like it's answers?  So, if I don't want to be a parent to a 7 year old, can I just kill it, because it's only a kid if the parents say it's a kid? 

Edit: Before any of you accuse me of not being a "true Democrat", way to exclude people from the party.  I have voted straight ticket Democrat since 1992 and I have a Bernie Sanders sticker on my car. 


Primero 
Hilarious how New Liberal Pope says greatest threat to mankind is still abortion. Couldn't we have nuked them instead of the Japanese?
Yeh.  He can join the long list of Republicans from decades past who point out how crazy the GOP now is and who are completely ignored.
Why would anyone ever have thought that less information would be beneficial?

How about also getting an apology from ALL the republicans, the NRA, gun manufacturers, and every gun-nut bully?

The 'Ban' that never existed...

The Hill printed an article 11/30/15 that debunked the 'gun control research ban':

&gt;...So contrary to Speier’s tale of great minds shackled and research suppressed, Congress in fact simply directed the CDC to stop promoting gun control. To reasonable minds this is not at all controversial. Congress should ignore the tricksters and continue holding the CDC to its mission of objective research, not pushing for gun control.

http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/politics/261307-why-congress-stopped-gun-control-activism-at-the-cdc
Why does the fed need to research this? Why wont bloomberg or mothets against guns?   
Banning research is never a good idea.  However, it also isn't really more research that we need here.  The solutions are already clear, and many other countries have shown that they work.  What we really need is *action*, and it is too easy to let the call for research be an excuse to avoid acting.
 And of course the reality is that Bush is directly to blame for the formation of Daesh.  But Fox will never admit to that...
Bush wasn't blamed for 7/7 either
Why check facts. He knows that just saying crap will make it true in the minds of his sheep. Look at the birther people, they still believe it.
This guy is basically a giant pathological liar. At least this is one thing he's honest about.

Well, looks like the GOP has It's nominee. They love blowhards who are totally divorced from reality. 
Dude, it was just a retweet.  It doesn't mean he's racist.  Just like retweeting stuff from stormfront doesn't make you a racist.  You are absolved of any responsibility so long as someone else tweeted it first.
This is the same bullshit excuse half the people come up with when I nail them on Facebook.  "Oh, I was just sharing something I saw.  It's up to the people that read it to decide if it's right or not."
How can he not check his facts? Either he has facts or not, he cannot not check them, if he wouldn't, he wouldn't have them
O'Reilly taking down Trump...how confusing for conservatives. 
&lt; Trump: Hey, Bill, Bill, am I gonna check every statistic? I get millions and millions of people, @RealDonaldTrump, by the way.

Typically yeah. But since your running for the Republican nomination, no you don't. Just make shit up. 
A "retweet".

Yet another example of his total lack of leadership.  His opinions blow with the wind.  If his base was opposed to apple butter, he'd suddenly spend half his media time railing against it.

He has no opinions of his own.
It would probably help if politics and media stopped using the word "fact" when they mean "comments". It annoys the hell out of me to see the word fact tossed around as if people are saying factual things. They aren't. Most things said lately have just been bad, biased comments and opinions. 
In other breaking news, water is still wet.
If you don't want these "suspects" to have guns, charge them with a crime. Until then, presumption of innocence requires your restraint. 

Depriving people of rights and privileges without so much as a formal accusation isn't liberalism. It's radically regressive. Charge them in a competent court, or leave them the fuck alone. 
Polly a good thing since everyone is a suspect and is under surveillance these days. The threshold for who is a suspect isn't what it used to be.
&gt; A legal loophole allows suspected terrorists on the government’s no-fly list to legally buy guns

That's not a loophole.  It's called the "no-**fly** list" for a reason.

What, is it also a loophole that the no-fly list doesn't stop them from driving and taking trains or skateboarding?
We really need to start thinking about a Repeal of the Second Amendment...
Good on you, NRA. Its nice to see someone sticking up for due process, the second amendment, and against racism.
Lies. Cherry-picked data that serves to further the liberally-biased media's agenda to undermine the morals of our great country. A black socialist Kenyan being elected to a position of power is destroying our country. Unemployment is actually much worse now and I know that because I have like 3 friends who looked for a job once but never got one and since I have 10 friends altogether that means our country's unemployment rate is actually 30% which is all Obama's fault. This is punishment from God for allowing him to be elected in the first place and now with gay people being offered RIGHTS he's going to be super mad because of Benghazi and the War on Christmas and moral fiber and small government and obamacare and IF YOU WANT MY GUNS YOU CAN COME TRY AND TAKE 'EM!

EDIT: Obligatory "thanks for the gold, stranger!" 
I'm not an expert or anything, but I think there was this thing called the 'Great Recession' that may have had something to do with this.
The fall of the unemployment is mostly due thanks to the extremely high price of oil that allowed shale gas/oil to be profitable since 2010. 
So I was watching the debate and Ted Cruz says something like "I have all the numbers on my website" to the question about how he will fund a government with a 10% flat tax.  Ready for the answer:  Assume 13+% gdp growth!  Edit: It's actually 13.9% above what is currently projected, so like 15+%
They know why their policies fail us - because they were never meant to help us.

Their policies succeed at doing exactly what they were meant to do - to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.

The reason they can't explain it is because that's the opposite of what you want to do when you're trying to convince the public to vote against their best interests.
"Its them darn liberals who won't let us double down on these ideas!" /s
Carly Fiorina didn't just not answer the question, she included in her answer "Yes, the economy DOES get worse under Democrats" which is the exact opposite of the statistics the questioner gave. Everything these guys have said about Obama have not come true so why do they keep getting so many votes?! My country is so stupid...it makes me sad.
Oh but they will explain it.  Once it's on Fox News it'll just be repeated over and over and over, quoting that "Some people say." until it is explained and fully believed.
how does agency go about screening migrants anyway? even if a syrian passport is authentic, how should a euro government check the person's background? i can't imagine you can just call the syrian records department and ask them for a file.
Sure.  Of course, what economic or political power *doesn't* want you to hate refugees?  :-/
How do we know what daesh wants? 
Isn't it strange that refugees won't be allowed in legally, but people come in illegally all the time?  

I'm not just talking about Latin Americans, we have people from all over the world who caught a flight to the U.S. and never went back home...

As usual, the Republicans are wrong again.   http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/24/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/
They also stated they would invade the west by the hundreds disguised as refugees.... maybe dont base your opinions from IS propaganda (or do they could be right for all i know) 
As someone who works at a prestigious public university, I'm actually pretty terrified by the fact that a such a prestigious public university would make a move like this. I'm definitely aware of the trend toward hiring nonacademics as university of presidents, but I didn't think it would happen "here".  It's not the fact that she doesn't have a PhD (or even a master's as far as I can tell) that's troubling, it's that no amount of political experience makes up for a lack of experience in academic culture.  That plus her shitty politics and for-profit mentality.
Plus, she's a [fucking bigot](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article42206535.html#!).


Dear University of North Carolina Men's Basketball Team,

What I'm afraid of is that schools will not treat their "customers" like Rodeo Drive customers but more like Comcast customers. When the goal is pure profits (and lets be honest, that is their only goal) they will not put the welfare of the students anywhere high on their priority list.
Students need to organize and push back against this trend toward turning public universities into publicly-subsidized, debt-financed corporations. 
I actually agree with adopting more of a "customer" mindset toward students. They're paying huge sums of money for their education, and I think schools often throw too many barriers in the way letting students focus on education and bettering themselves (crappy technology, poor building design, extremely limited parking, arcane processes, ultra-political administrations, inadequate communications, etc.).

However, there needs to be a balance. College is a place where people should learn -- and often, you learn by being challenged and made uncomfortable with your ideas. If we coddle students academically, they won't learn as much. So, I think that's the real danger with the new president: coddling students and adopting a "customer is always right" mentality.
Remember it wasn't about race. 
And I was all like, "Damn, I never knew Stephen King was an asshole!"
Shocking. 
Can he produce Ted's mom's birth certificate? She is Cruz's only connection to America.

Wow I love living in the most conservative district in the state of Iowa...
It doesnt matter who created ISIS.  This isnt a divided matter.  ALL Americans should want them wiped off the face of the earth...200+ on a russian plane 100+ in france.  Over dozen in California...

Stop pointing fingers....if i want to i could say, our president said they were a jv team.  So if thats true bush created a jv terrorist group.  then i guess our current president  allowed them become a professional terrorist  team...


Great idea. Really, um, original...

I mean, there was definitely nobody else in history who thought of this, right guys?
That's fucked up. It's like the Red Scare and Nazi Germany all over again.
I imagine he would've done the same with the Jews if hating the jews would give him votes.
At least he's open about it.  Let's not pretend data isn't being collected and stored generally.
Do you want to be compared to Hitler? Because that's how you get compared to Hitler.
So this quote made me suspicious:

&gt;When directly asked Thursday evening by NBC reporter Vaughn Hillyard about the possibility of a database of Muslims, Trump agreed with the idea, using the words "certainly" and "absolutely."

It makes it look like they are trying to distort what he really said to make it look worse. Then I saw the video of him saying it..... It's pretty ridiculous
But if you put gun owners in a database, that's TYRANNY!!
Leave it to Trump to say something that immediately and correctly triggers Godwin's Law. 
I imagine there already is one.  I mean, this is America, right?
Trump was talking about a wall to block illegal immigration. Very shoddy and intentionally misleading reporting.
I think that we need a database of people with bad Comb-Overs!  If you have nothing to hide what do you care?
Good grief, what is this? The mutant registration?
A nice lovely database and they are going to pay for it, its going to be great!
LOL…retailers give Americans exactly what they demand, Americans get angry. 
Look…back in the 70s and 80s, Americans were smart enough to organize and stand up against shit like this. Those days are long gone. 90% of Americans will say, 'OMG FLAT SCREEN FOR $150' and then get in line at 2:00 am on black friday. 

That's the problem. Consumers are the problem. They love shit more than they value tradition or family or fairness. 

Bottom line. If there was no call for Black Friday bullshit, you can bet KMart would stay closed. 
The really big story is that retail workers usually don't know their schedules two weeks ahead all year long. 
DON'T SHOP ON THANKSGIVING DAY.

Walmart employee here, also don't have my schedule for the week of Thanksgiving yet. No one at my store does but I'm not sure about other stores. I know I'll have to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday because everyone does but I have no idea what hours. I haven't been able to plan anything with my family because of this.
Guys, **DON'T shop on Thanksgiving Day**. I work retail and fuck Thanksgiving Day shoppers.

So you can go drink to your heart's content and pass out watching football?  Sucks for me because I have to stay sober so I can serve your selfish ass later that night.  You can enjoy family?  Not me!  I have a limited time because you CHOOSE to ruin my family time because you demand fucking sales.  You can sleep in and chill all day?  I'm exhausted because I've been running around crazy juggling family and work.  

Guess what?  Sales exist on Black Friday too.  We serve you 362 days a year.  All we ask is for our 3 holidays (Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas Day) to have a normal life.  It isn't the end of the world to wait a single day for a sale.

And don't get me wrong...  I have nothing wrong with Black Friday, but the second you take my family time, you can gladly go fuck yourself.

Edit:  Sorry for the rant.  But I've actually had a customer get upset at me for my store being closed on Easter.  My response, "I have family too."  That's the only time when I've thrown customer service out the window.
Honestly I don't mind working Thanksgiving. I *wish* my job was open Thanksgiving so I could work. I fucking hate that holiday. No point flying home to my grandparents for a holiday I don't like when I'm gonna turn around a month later and fly back there again for Christmas, a holiday that's actually fun. Too expensive, too much travel.

I'll be spending Thanksgiving at the movie theater, probably, unless one of my friends hits me up with a better offer.
In my small town we only have W-M, and they'll not see hide nor hair of me on Thanksgiving.
if they dont like it then they can quit. dont be such a little bitch about someone elses job
The Walton family invests lots of money in Christian Family Values political organizations,  They want strong families for everyone but their own employees. 

How can you build strong families when you can't even plan a family dinner on a day that was once  a sacred event of prayer and thanksgiving. 

Those Waltons need more money to donate to Christian Family Values organizations.  If you support that, go shopping and help them.  /s
&gt;"Scientists say it was aliens who came down and built them or whatever."

Wow.  That's dangerous. 
It's not a "theory", he's just an idiot. 
Ben Carson's critical thinking skill is badly calibrated. He's critical of every fact he hears, but not at all critical of his own ideas. Madness.
This man is a living breathing example of what can happen when public education is undermined and underfunded for generations.  It is an absolute disgrace, and should be a point of great embarrassment and shame for every American, that such lunacy as this is allowed to not only exist in the first place, but take high office and enjoy a flourishing popularity among the electorate.  

From the outside looking in - being that I am British - the fact that he is well educated in one specific area - indeed to the point I am told he is actually a well respected surgeon - is proof positive of something the rest of the world has been desperately trying to warn America about for a long time: faith schools and home schooling do not work.  Yes, they produce results when a student shows aptitude in a particular niche area, such as medicine.  But they provide no framework for the student to develop critical thinking skills outside of that narrow window.  Hence, we're now at the point where the front-runner for Presidential candidate, representing the party of Jefferson and Lincoln, has literally zero capacity for rational thinking - and yet it hasn't stopped him from excelling in the particular field for which he was trained.

More worrying still, is that this is precisely what makes him popular with those who similarly lack basic critical thinking skills, who believe that his success in one specific area, to the detriment of all others, is testement to the supposed success of that very same system of so-called bible-based education.  It's as if these people are being churned out; programmed to carry out specific tasks, and execute them with absolute precision, with no mind for how their work relates to and interacts with other areas of expertise.  This is demonstrated by what happens, when you ask them to perform a task which they haven't been trained to do, and they fall apart like a cheap suit.  

Moreover, even the painful to watch flailing and impossible to comprehend gobbledegook which ensues, when they're placed in this position, seems to whizz past the very people who should be worried the most by the fact these people represent them, and presume to speak on their behalf.  An indifference to this fact is not the stuff upon which America was built, but it could very easily be the thing which brings it down.  
How does a medical profession take biology classes with components of evolutionary biology and genetics and just completely disregard them? You know what? How does he reject the process of peer review? Those mental gymnastics must be unbelievable. Unreal.
Someone has played too much Civ III.
Is this guy for real? Are we being trolled?
That's why you should never preform brain surgery on yourself.
Ben Carson is the new poster child for truthiness.
"Whew, after decades of labor, impossibly heavy materials and entire fortunes spent, our pyramid-shaped granary is finally finished. OK boys, bring in the-- hey, is that a dead Pharaoh? Great, now this pyramid is contaminated. I guess we'll just have to build another one."
This guy is even beginning to make batshit crazy people look sane - at least they aren't (all) trying to run for POTUS
what is the deal with this reddit overreaction to this pyramid "grain" theory and why is it a big deal?  who cares?  it's 100x more logical than what Ben Carson's said about evolution or the big bang.  
I am studying him in my reading techniques I class and I can't stand it because I want it to be so over! XD his logic doesn't make a lick of sense.
Why does the only presidential candidate that I happen to know personally have to be a complete moron...
How is the trog still around?
I don't blame it on the *way they're saying it*, I blame it on the fundamental precept of the ideology.

If you actually believe that a zygote is equal to a human being, then it makes perfect sense to kill people that destroy zygotes.  Suppose a clinical researcher studying embryonic stem cells will be responsible for the destruction of thousands or millions of zygotes.  If you actually believe that those clumps of cells are equal to sentient human beings, then it's the same as talking about someone murdering thousands or millions of people.  If there were the equivalent of a Nazi extermination camp operating in your city, would you write a letter to your Senator, or would you do something about it?

I think for Conservatives to say something like, "I believe that human life begins at conception, but I disagree with the methods of this extremist," is a totally chickenshit back-pedal.  Because if you *really, actually* believed that to be the case, you should feel just as justified in killing abortion doctors and clinical researchers as you would in launching a guerilla attack on an extermination camp.  It's chickenshit because they either don't actually believe it, or they are unwilling to admit it that to be the case.

I think instances like this really lay bare the façade.  Because ***this*** is what it actually looks like if a zygote is equal to a human.  If you think that a person who commits an act like this is "insane" or "extreme," what you are actually saying is that it's insane or extreme to believe that zygotes and humans are of equal value.

My guess is that if people aren't cheering this murder, they don't actually believe deep down that zygotes are people, but they say they do because it's part of a pre-packaged *set* of beliefs that they culturally identify with, rather than having actually critically examined what it means, ethically, for zygotes to be people. 
Anti-abortion activists spend hundreds of millions of dollars on hateful, threatening rhetoric, then claim it has no effect.  

How much did those videos cost that specifically targeted Planned Parenthood with outright lies and despicable statements?  


The are claiming that what they spent so much money for was not intended to cause any changes in thinking or behavior.  

That is unbelievable to me. 
The author is right, we need to start holding people accountable for the things they say. Who says that they should be allowed a platform to spew they bullshit all over? They can come back to the table after they've taken a long time out and thought about the almost irreparable damage they've done to this country and the world in general.
I'm sorry you got your feelings hurt, but that doesn't change the first amendment. 
This reminds me of Jeremy Osborne "fuck you bush" from peep show. It's about as well thought out.

He looks like a jaded, pouting character, scion of a degenerate race from the original Star Trek.
With the exception of Paul, does anyone else feel that we are all going to die in WWIII if one of these bozo's gets elected. I mean the sabre rattling last night was a bit unnerving. Really? No fly zone? we'll start shooting down Russian jets. Fucking idiots.
So he wants to go back to Iraq? Fucking third time's the charm, right Carson?

I'd be seriously worried, but he's just some guy talking in his sleep, anyway.
Someone ask him a question about Uz-becky-becky-stan.
Has he ever given a concise, coherent answer on anything? 
I *swear* I would love to see Carson get tested for abusing Benzos. I've known (and worked with) a lot of Benzo addicts (xanax, ativan, etc) and they have the exact same type of speech pattern and facial expressions. 

I think people believe that if you abuse benzos that you just sound like you're drunk. Not true…you sound like *this*. Like your brain is on slow motion and your body is trying to sleep while you're standing up.

Can you imagine this guy driving in hectic traffic? His reaction time seems like it's off by about 12 seconds. Comes across as kind of creepy even. 
&gt;  We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I've learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.

Ah yes, the "Make them look like losers" strategy.

Looks like the right wing in the US is finding their Brownshirts. 
&gt; But Ben (and other Republicans) didn’t pay attention in history class. Nowhere in history do you see a bombing campaign winning a war.

To be fair, that's an outright lie. Two nuclear bombs on Japan finally made them surrender.
It just demonstrates yet again how simple-minded the Republican candidates are and how little they know about the Middle East. Their responses are childish. 
I don't know if that's an original turn of phrase, spaceghoti, but war-gasm is brilliant.
The Republican way: when in doubt, shoot 'em up!
did i not watch the democratic debate with every candidate calling for a military intervention? whats the difference 
It's legitimately frightening that even after proving his ignorance time and time again, this guy still has an extremely large group of supporters. 
His very first answer was actually not a terrible one. Using social media and our other resources to damage the image of ISIS. I think that is a tremendous idea.  Went downhill pretty fast from there, however.
You can't go full butter on *Fox "News".*

Is it me or is the media starting to shun him? That would be great to just have a total media black out of Ben!

Oh, my new thing, all gop candidates get ! in honor of Jeb! so Trump! Ben! Rubio! and all the rest!
He is a dull speaker, but often very logical. He would be the best option for the GOP. For the Liberals, let's just hope Jim Webb revives his campaign ;)
"Full blown nutter". Sure.
Maybe *this time* things'll change for the better.

Oh wait, America, yeah. You'd rather have the 'freedom' to shoot each other than the assurance that you can walk down the street safely.
I really know Obama is a politician, but can he fucking act you know, political?

Madman shoots up a school, you can convince people on both sides of the aisle that that is horrible, but we do nothing

Manman shoots up a place conservatives already hate and we choose now to push for gun control?    This is the least likely time to get it passed.    

God Obama, learn to play your audience.
It should be hard to get instruments that make it easy to kill large numbers of people. Your hobby is not more important than the general public's safety. 
And gun sales keep going up.
All emotions are based on two things... love and hate. 
 
Since love and fear can hardly exist together, if we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved. 
 
So the scared individuals in our society are the ones that believe they are not going to be safe unless they have a gun. 
 
The brave individuals are the ones who don't feel it necessary to carry a gun to be safe and know that the chances of killing yourself with a gun is twice as much as someone killing you with one.
Alcoholic-addict here, sober 44 years+, worked in the treatment field for 15+ years (1972-1987) have known and interacted with more than 10,000 other addicted - never, ever, not once, met any claiming their addiction had anything to do with 'political correctness' or anything approximately similar.
I swear, Ben Carson is just putting these quotes together like mad libs from words he knows his Tea Party base will hear be riled up about
He's not really blaming political correctness, if you really think about what he's actually trying to say. He's basically saying "Y'all drug addicted motherfuckers need Jesus".

I agree that maybe people turn to drugs because they have something lacking in their lives, but it's never Jesus. Jesus never did shit for anybody.
Now that there is less than 1 year left -we're going to start seeing all this stuff come to the forefront of the media. Finally all these guys can go away
It's official, he's a crackpot.
And here we can see an example of a misleading headline. 
Becoming more and more like /r/nottheonion daily.
No one likes Political Correctness, Ben, but I don't think you're right about that.
I  short she claimed no one should notice her support NOW is all from big wall street money becuase of somethong that happened over 14 years ago.

The money wall street gives her NOW is because of what they  know she will do for them NOW.
Gonna lift a comment from r/politics on this by u/msx8

&gt;ITT: redditors for whom the title of this click bait article was 
designed.

&gt;Clinton's comments about her donor base weren't bullshit at all. First off, if Sanders can brag about how his donors are mostly from people giving "30 bucks", then it's fair for Clinton to highlight that 60% of her donors are women. The female vote is crucial in a general election, so it's a perfectly legitimate fact for her to highlight.

&gt;Now, onto the 9/11 comment. She was essentially being asked why big businesses and banks contribute so heavily to her campaign. She explained, correctly, that New York was attacked on 9/11. The markets closed after the terrorist attack, and the city needed their Senator to stand with them and help them rebuild so that business could get back to normal. Clinton was a very strong advocate for getting federal resources to New York after 9/11, and she did a good job on that, so it only follows that NYC-based businesses in general contributed to her campaigns, financial services companies included.

&gt;Bernie Sanders even said she was right and that he appreciates what she did for New York after 9/11.

&gt;Of course, I fully expect Clinton's political opponents to manipulate the electorate by taking her comment out of context and saying she blames 9/11 for her taking campaign contributions from banks. Any objective observer of tonight's debate, however, will see through that strategy.
This guy is fucking amazing.

He is an insanely high functioning idiot. I can't believe he exists.

Holy shit!!  He's real life Forrest Gump!!!
This plays into the mythology, or maybe just the assumption, that the new U.S. and state governments after the revolution were formed up out of nothing. In reality, a lot of the political structures were in place in the colonies and merely transferred over to the new country.
&gt; After this fact check appeared, Carson’s Facebook post was edited to read “no federal elected office experience.”

Yeah, duh, there being no federal government until they founded it. Up to that point it could be ignorance, but now he's just being deceptive.
Is there some kind of stupidity test to be a GOP Presidential Candidate?
Typical liberal bias media.  Pointing out that a conservative politician is wrong.  Learn to nod your head and move along like real journalists.
And he is still the GOP front runner, tells a lot about this country.
I'm astounded by the hubris it must take to think that with zero related experience you could believe you are fit to hold the most difficult position in the free world. 
Its funny that the campaign's change to stipulate the founders had no "federal" experience before founding the federal government makes the comment even more of a joke!
He needs to attend the Broadway show 'Hamilton'. Most founding fathers were either already in government, or diplomats (Jefferson, Franklin).
Carson's rep wants to know if they get points for "intent." I guess he really doesn't understand the point of a FACT check. That's exactly the problem with Carson and these other bozos. They only care about intent and not at all about facts.
"Hey #Blacklivesmatter. This is your cue to STFU and realize that you're lucky to live here." 

That was particularly troubling because it implies that black people are somehow less American than the rest of us.     
Bush family has made the world a safer place. /s
Less than one hour after the President's statement, one of my right-wing friends posted a graphic asking *"Just out of curiosity, has anyone in the obama administration used the words Islamic Terrorists, or Muslim Extremists to describe the attacks in France yet?
No?....Didn't think so."*
It took my most conservative friends less than an hour to blame Obama,  gun control,  immigration,  and refugees for the attacks today...
I'm sure they'll blame gay marriage, welfare, and planned parenthood too.
It's pretty fucked up that many of these pundits and politicians are using this tragedy as a way to bitch about black lives matter and the Mizzou situation. 
Don't worry, they'll be blaming the French (again) soon enough.
I made room on my Facebook friends list. 
Yeah Mizzou kids, take that!

Its not like y'all were just threatened with violence over yik yak... Its not like not long ago a church full of black folks was targeted for a mass killing! 
the music was a bit over the top.
Title is kinda silly and the music was a little to Inception for my tastes but the clips were good.
The establishment really does not want people seeing Bernie saying "Not good enough" I noticed it was missing from the CBS YouTube feed.
 There is only one topic that I don't agree with Sanders on, and that's Israel.  Whether that's enough to get me to vote for someone else in the primary, I'm not sure yet.

Edit: why the downvotes for expressing an opinion?
66% of Americans want Climate Change addressed - 56% of Congress, all 'republicans', preventing it.

http://billmoyers.com/2015/02/03/congress-climate-deniers/
I'm all for addressing climate change. I think the idea here is that we have narrowed our focus of the main culprit of the change to man and that we have blinded ourselves from exploring issues like solar flares, asteroidal impacts, methane, pole shifts, our planets proximity in the universe. This short sightedness could cause thousands of deaths due to people not being able to afford heat in the winter. These kinds of narrow thought also open up them selves to massive exploitation by energy monopolies. Follow the money people. Climate change makes me sad but not nearly as sad as rampant ecological destruction. Does no one remember the magic school bus?
"Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."
Why would they choose to hurt their standing among their peers by condemning this action?
I think there's a point he's a little behind on: taking out their families is exactly what we *have* been doing, with our drone strikes on innocent civilians.  It doesn't exactly inspire them to give up and go home.  In fact, it does the opposite.
Donald trump on ants: drown em in sugar water!

&amp;nbsp;

Donald trump on rabbit infestations: give em a nice warm environment with plenty of food and water and isolate them to death!

&amp;nbsp;

Donald trump on terrorists: bomb civilians with one or two degrees separation from radicalized muslims and demonize the billion or so humans who share their faith!

&amp;nbsp;

Fuck yeah Donny
Jesus fuck.
"I'M GOING TO TAKE OUT YOUR FAMILIES!!!!


to a nice dinner at the Olive Garden 

after I get elected president of the U.S.
So, America would have a stated policy of committing crimes against humanity? Why not change our flag to a skull and crossbones and tell the rest of the world, "Look at us, we're the evil empire!"
He's starting to remind me of John Travolta in swordfish.
With the terrorist doing that to us hasn't stopped us from attacking them, it acutely increased our response. 
Yeah, My Lai totally made the VC give up!
Okay, Ben Carson is a huge nutball, but he never claimed to seek admission to West Point. He claims that he met with a general who told him that he'd be able to get him in and wouldn't have to pay anything. 

He was fuzzy on the details, and told it innacurately. The only way this is a huge lie/coverup is if he never actually did meet with that general. 

Focus on better ways to demonstrate his insanity; his supporters can defend this one pretty easily and it doesn't help our cause to keep harping on this one. 
Am I the only one asking... Who?
Bobby Jindal did the ultimate prick dad move by promising his children a dog when they move into the White House.

My contempt for this man is fathomless.
This man is a terrorist.  He openly panders to clergy who call for the murder of people on the grounds of their religion and gives them greater voice.  He is Al Qaeda in a suit.  The only difference between him and ISIS is that ISIS takes responsibility for the killing they inspire.  Cruz just cowardly hides behind absurd details like typos on voter registration forms.

Places to be a little concerned about a terrorist attack in the US:

1) New York City

2) Washington D.C

3) Los Angeles

4) Chicago

97) Phoenix

9842) Literally any of the rural towns in the US where you are most likely to hear people whine about the threat of Daesh and/or Syrian refugees.
This is a serious article?
I think her cholesterol level is a greater danger to her than Daesh.
I have a feeling the car ride to the coffee shop is statistically more of a threat to anyone living in AZ than an islamic terrorist.
I wanna be just like her when I grow up!
Lol! 
So brave
Brave woman fights terrorism with expensive coffee.
Deeply troubled by the news of the terrorist attacks in Paris. Praying for those who are suffering and grieving.

Breitbart is losing its shit over this...in support of Carson.
&gt;Editor’s note: POLITICO stands by its reporting on this story, which has been updated to reflect Ben Carson’s on the record response. The original story and headline said that Carson’s campaign had admitted he "fabricated" a "full scholarship" from West Point, but now Carson denies that his campaign’s statement constituted such an admission, and the story and headline were changed to reflect that. POLITICO’s reporting established that Carson said he received a "full scholarship" from West Point, in writing and in public appearances over the years — but in fact he did not and there is actually no such thing as a "full scholarship" to the taxpayer-funded academy. And today in response to POLITICO he acknowledged for the first time that was not the case. Carson never explicitly wrote that he had applied for admission to West Point, although that was the clear implication of his claim to have received an offer of a "full scholarship," a point that POLITICO’s initial report should have made clear.

Here is what Carson wrote in his book:

&gt;At the end of my twelfth grade I marched at the head of the Memorial Day parade. I felt so proud, my chest bursting with ribbons and braids of every kind. To make it more wonderful, We had important visitors that day. Two soldiers who had won the Congressional Medal of Honor in Viet Nam were present. More exciting to me, General William Westmoreland (very prominent in the Viet Nam war) attended with an impressive entourage. Afterward, Sgt. Hunt introduced me to General Westmoreland, and I had dinner with him and the Congressional Medal winners. Later I was offered a full scholarship to West Point. I didn’t refuse the scholarship outright, but I let them know that a military career wasn’t where I saw myself going.

Considering that West Point does not offer scholarships and admission is free as long as you serve in the military afterwards, it's more likely that a recruiter told Carson he wouldn't have to pay tuition if he applied to West Point and Carson misinterpreted this as a scholarship offer. Hell, I wouldn't even put it past a military recruiter to call it a scholarship, making it seem more prestigious and exclusive.

It looks like POLITICO got caught editorializing a bit in an attempt at a gotcha, which is why they had to change the headline and insert an editor's note to walk back their initial claim that Carson fabricated the story. Dan Rather would be proud.
The "Ben Carson admits to fabricating..." list begins with this.  So long Dr. Carson.  You had a good run.  Join Herman Cain on the radio but be sure to bring Jaime Dupree along for, you know, common sense.
Man, Alex has really been snorting some of the good stuff.

You should take anything Ted Negent says with as much weight as you take any thing Gary Busey says. Except Gary Busey says some genuinely hilarious stuff.
Gun violence rates have been falling steadily and consistently since 1992. They are now lower than they were at any point in the 20th century. Gun violence isn't **emerging**. Gun violence is **receding**. 

Gun violence is a National Recedency.  
I'm not sure what she is thinking here.  Anti-Gun is a poor position to have politically.  Quite simply the people who are against it vote on the issue the people who are for it don't.  In the current political climate moving the goal posts towards gun control is as if not more difficult than moving the goal posts on single payer healthcare.  If she's going to step out on a limb and piss people off it might as well the people who aren't going to vote for her anyway.
The education system that we maintain to create worker drones and soldiers is the real national emergency . We create the psychopaths then are surprised when they snap and shoot up the place that made them... 

Please before you down vote me, study up on the British model of schooling as well as the Prussian system and the Spartan system. I think you will find some undeniable similarities between them and our current common core. The results do not lie.
Seems the troll has leveled up.
Why on Earth do people still listen to the things she comes up with?
