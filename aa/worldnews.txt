4 separate attacks at 4 separate locations in Paris per CNN.

This is very coordinated. Multiple gunmen/bombers involved.

People throwing bed sheets from their windows to help cover the dead, it's such an odd thing to hear, just made me cry.
IMPORTANT:

If you're stuck in Paris, the City of Paris has a free emergency number, 0800406005. The City asks people to stay inside their homes, and to host anyone who is stuck outside.
In Paris right now, couple blocks away. My brother is a reporter and he went on site, I'm monitoring TV and social media for him, will update this post with anything I get from him.

The metro stations around the attacks are closed so we'll see how close he can get.

EDIT: Okay guys we all know this can only be a big coincidence and i am sure the guy just "guessed" what will happen. So lets dont dive too deep into the conspiracy hole.

EDIT2: I know guys it seems suspicious but please it's just speculation and nothing is proven!
Heard shootings very close to a restaraunt I was eating in near Bastille about an hour ago.  Was a bit concerned but thought it was probably fire crackers and the waiter assured me I was fine to walk home so I did.   Absolutely fuck this.  

Edit:  thank you for the well wishes. I'm fine and safe in my apartment.  Devastated for everyone affected and for this magnificent city and wonderful people. 
No matter how many times something like this happens, I still get sick to my stomach. It's just overwhelming to think about people who won't get to go home to their lives ones because of senseless violence. Thinking of the family and friends of those involved. 
If you are in Paris outside right now, and want shelter, there's #PorteOuverte on twitter, people will help you !
Interview on CNN summary:

1 - The person interviewing was inside "It was a blood bath:

2 - People were stepping over people trying to escape

3 - the shooters were QUIET (one was young, 20years old), they were saying NOTHING.

4 - Shooters were UNMASKED, were CALM, reloaded.

5 - They were shooting in random directions, still MANY HOSTAGES inside

6 - His friend is still stuck inside, texting him, saying police has NOT entered yet.

Reddit crashed. 

Gunning people down in the street, or when they are at a bar on a friday night or watching a football game. The ideology of whoever is behind this is absolutely twisted and full of hatred. I hope they are caught swiftly and removed from the planet. 

Thinking of all those who have had their hearts broken tonight when they hear its their loved one who was shot and bled to death in the gutter. Tragedy.

edit: to all those telling me it was muslims and i should just say it, I didnt say 'whoever did this' to be fucking coy, I said it to be accurate, at that time we did not know who did it, so yeh, we had suspicions and it seemed obvious but it isnt responsible to 'report' speculation.
**Not confirmed**



Unclear if legitimate: This was posted on Facebook http://reho.st/self/bb35f753d0f02407cfd3a802b6222f89fc88df4a.jpg It says "I'm still in Bataclan. Badly injured ! They have to raid the place asap. There are survivors inside. They are executing everyone. One by one. 1st floor quickly !!!!"

Pictures of the French footballers watching the big screens in the Stade de France relaying the tragic news, (just shown on SKY TV) - goalkeeper Lloris just looks devastated.
ALL IN PARIS: Stick to texting with your families to free up bandwidth. Networks overloaded.
BLANKET curfew (as opposed to a few streets) has just been imposed in Paris for first time since Allied Forces were fighting Nazis in WWII.
My mother is there right now and her husband and her were supposed to be at the one of the sites.  We cannot get ahold of them. Does anyone know any ideas how to?
People in Paris, please remember to not post police or troop movements to Reddit or other social media.  

Edit: Thankfully, it seems to finally be over. The only consolation is that the bomb attacks could possibly have been much worse. Now all we can do is thank the first responders and good Samaritans,  hope there is no foolish and misguided "vengeance" taken on refugees or European Muslims, and look for those responsible.
Was at the Bataclan like an hour ago during the shooting. The guy entered through the front door, probably firing like 60 rounds by clips of 30 I would say. The crowd collapsed and we were all laying on the ground.

The guy just fucking spread on the pit, I just prayed not to get hit. People managed to get out by crawling on the stairs of the nearest exit. I just did the same, crawling over other people on the stairs like a fucking cockroach fighting for his life.

Don't know about the performers.

EDIT: For all you kind souls asking, I have been safe and sound at a family member's place since I posted.

I will be contacting the police tomorrow or on Monday. There will not be a lot of going outside this weekend.

The news is that there are about 70 to 100 casualties in the venue. The RAID (french police hit squad) raided the venue and killed the three bastards.

Thank you for your support, take some time to think of the victims instead of writing to one of the survivors. They need it.
IMPORTANT if you are outside in Paris check #porteouverte on twitter. We open our doors to people in need of safety.

**Edit : PLEASE do not flood this hashtag on twitter, leave it for emergency purpose only (ie. if you are looking for or offering a safe place).**
I'm french guy living near Paris watching live news right now. For the moment we are talking about several shootings in the 10th discrit in Paris.
For the background we have avoid an attack few days ago: http://news.yahoo.com/france-says-foiled-attack-marines-toulon-211653159.html

22h22 Arms used in the 10th discrit attack were AK47. Events are still running

22h25 At least 1 killed in Stade de Fance

22h26 French tv presentators: we're not talking about terrorism yet but it smells shit

22h27 There were a lot of people in the streets during the 10th district attack apparently. There is a big football match tonigh. People are confined by police in bars and restaurants



22h31 French president was evacuated from Stade de France

22h34 Fuck at least 18 deads...

22h37 We are talking about hostages in Bataclan, a concert hall in the 11th district, fuck fuck fuck 

22h42 There were 4 explosions at Stade de France near the doors of the stadium

22h44 Apparently people in the stade does not know about the event (sorry if writings are confuse I have family at the phone)

22h49 A lot of police forces are massing around stade de france. There is fear about the end of the match and the 40.000 people that will go out... Please if you are in paris right now stay safe, don't go out if you can suspects are still running

22h55 The situation at Bataclan is critical. Hundreds of people are hostages right now... FUCK I can't tell you how the situation is getting worse

22h58 They have just showed the images at stade de france where we can here explosions. This is a FUCKING coordinated attack, not the amateurs this time. Vendredi/Friday 13. Wtf

23h00 People are quitting the stade de france right now, little scenes of panic. Still 18 deads officially 3 Deads at Stade de France and 15 in the 10th district

23h09 New shootings in the 10th district. Situation is very confused. This is a strange atmosphere, very tense

23h14 Lot a fear for the bataclan. I'm crying. If this is true we're living a tragedy. They apparently entenred the place and begin to fire on hundred of people. They apparently had time to reload several times. What the fuck. For my own sanity I'll this feed stop here sorry and thanks for all the support

My hands are shaking while write this lines... What the fuck why again...

Thanks for the golds. I whish I would never get theses ones...
Fuck I live right next to it, I hear the police sirens going off non-stop... It's pretty fucking frightening, especially in a neighborhod with so many pubs and restaurants, so man people outside this evening... I hope everybody is going to be all right, my thoughts to the family of the deceased.

For those using the #PorteOuverte tag, turn off "location" on your device and exchange location info via DM. Please stay safe. 
https://www.periscope.tv/w/1OyJAmadvzDJb a guy is live on periscope from across the street.

It ended now, but listen at 9:55, you can hear a lot of gunshots.

Apparently there are hostages at the concert hall, too.
I'm in Paris right now. I was about to enter a club for a party and it finally had been cancelled due to the shootings. We heard about it after entering the city. There are so many police and army (GIGN) cars, fireman trucks... It is scary as shit. Entire districts have been closed by the police. Schools and universities will be shut down tomorrow. Frontiers are now closed. Everything seems so surreal to me. Hopefully my friends and I head back to our hometown in my girlfriend's car. We are safe. We keep hearing the sirens and see many signals, it's freaking alarming.

We hear from the radio that other explosions take place in this very moment.

I wish the best for people who are kept prisoners in the Bataclan.

Ps : Excuse my shitty english. I'm fucking terrified.

Hello everyone, this might get buried but I would appreciate all help. I'm an American in Paris at the moment and I'm currently stuck at a bar. I would appreciate any updates that's accurate about the situation outside. They are currently keeping us inside the bar as where I am is extremely close to one of the shootings. Please, if anyone can help me out and just keep me updated I would appreciate it.

EDIT: I'm completely safe, I didn't get to use wifi for a moment so I didn't get to respond to all the kind words. Thank you everyone, I was shocked to receive them when I finally got wifi again this morning. Thank you, thank you. Reddit is such an incredible and warm community. Once again, thanks guys I hope for everyone else you know they are safe and sound as well.

Up to 6-8 gunmen all together in 3 attacks. 12 killed https://twitter.com/RamiAlLolah/status/665279213814079488
Unconfirmed reports saying there's been a shooting at Paris Gare du Nord

This is fucking disgusting. Very few things in this world make me this angry. People need to band together not as french, american, christians, non-religious, whatever the fuck you are, but as humans against this shit.


No one deserves to be minding their own business by themselves, with their friends, family, SOs or whatever and be gunned down/stabbed/blown up for no fucking reason.


It's sickening. Rise against this shit.


edit since not really seen below: 

I can only hope that every major world power will band together to eradicate the people responsible for these things from the planet. I'm not pulling a "someone do something", I'm pulling a we need to put all other differences aside right now because this is one of the biggest problems we have ever faced as a collective population.

More and more terrorist attacks are occurring in closer and closer proximity, and this sort of thing damages entire nations, not just the people who lost their lives or were injured today.

Shootings at the Bataclan (known spectacle scene) during the show of Eagles of death metal.
Don't know yet about death but there is a lot of injured people.

obama talking about it right now
My father was murdered in a bombing when I was a baby, and I just want to use this medium to reach out to anyone who is missing someone today and let them know that they're not alone. There's a strong community of people like us that are working hard to move on, stay strong, and make as much of a difference as we possibly can. Allow yourself to mourn but don't be afraid. It'll always hurt and be a part of you, but humans are so much more resilient than we give ourselves credit for. 

Find love. Find peace within you even though the world around us can't give it to you right now. Find a way to smile again. You'll make it through.

My mom is currently vacationing in Paris. If any casualty list comes up, please send it my way. And please hope for the best for my sake and everyone else as well.

EDIT: She just picked up the phone and is just fine. She's at her friends house in the district adjacent to where all the stuff went down, and she's spending the night there. Thank you everyone for your thoughts and lets hope this ends with no more lives lost.
For any Canadians: Canadian government opens lines for families of people in Paris sos@international.gc.ca or call collect at 1-613-996-8885.
Those in Paris (and everywhere else) tomorrow, or as soon as possible, **donate blood**. Hospitals treating wounded are going to be running through their supplies rapidly and will need more. 
CNN said there is a person inside the theature which is saying they are killing people 1 by 1, and screamed at them to raid it.
It's incredible to think that in this day and age,this news can reach the other side of the world(west coast USA) before the event has come to a conclusion. It's a strange feeling sitting here in a lecture being unable to do anything but post on the internet. I'm sick to my stomach thinking about what has occurred. My classmates seem totally unaware that this is even occurring. I feel torn in that I feel involved and connected via the internet, but my lecturer just keeps talking and the reality over here is no different than any other day. What, besides posting on the internet, can we as anonymous observers do? It's a disturbing and utterly unsettling.  

Edit: I feel that I need to add a bit of context, for perspective sake. My mother is French and I have relatives in France. When I posted this I thought my cousin was in Paris. I have messaged him on Facebook and he told me that he is safe and nowhere near there.
[This guy on Periscope](https://www.periscope.tv/StephHannache/1rmGPWdQwaYKN) is filming the ambulances outside of the theater. I think I heard him say that he wasn't filming the police in order to prevent anyone seeing their movements. If that's accurate, what a thoughtful person.
Offtopic. Twitter is a shambles, initially its good for information but then its literally just the rest of the world retweeting each other and speculating.

There needs to be a way to filter tweet by original tweet location (by long/lat). 
A gag request in regards to the Bataclan has been announced.
French president evacuated.

[Another video on streamable](https://streamable.com/dd5i)
Per The Guardian (7:37 a.m. in Paris time):

&gt;**Eyewitness: 'He swivelled right, swivelled left and opened fire'**

&gt;Psychotherapist **Mark Colclough**, a 43-year-old British-Danish dual citizen, was with a colleague on Rue de la Fontaine when he witnessed a gunman attack a cafe.

&gt;He told the Guardian what he saw:

&gt;&gt;*He was standing in a shooting position. He had his right leg forward and he was standing with his left leg back. He was holding up to his left shoulder a long automatic machine gun – I saw it had a magazine beneath it.*

&gt;&gt;*Everything he was wearing was tight, either boots or shoes and the trousers were tight, the jumper he was wearing was tight, no zippers or collars. Everything was toned black.*

&gt;&gt;*If you think of what a combat soldier looks like, that is it – just without the webbing. Just a man in military uniform, black jumper, black trousers, black shoes or boots and a machine gun. Maybe a woolly hat.*

&gt;&gt;*He was left-handed and shooting in bursts of three or four shots. It was fully intentional, professional bursts of three or four shots.*

&gt;&gt;*He killed three or four individuals who were sitting in the chairs in front of the cafe. We saw them get shot down. They fell off their chairs on to the ground.*

&gt;&gt;*He then swivelled and shot through a car driver’s window.*

&gt;&gt;*We then saw him walk into the cafe. He swivelled right and then swivelled left and opened fire. That is when we dived for cover.*

&gt;&gt;*We heard a total of maybe 15 or 20 shots, then everything went quiet.*

Jesus.
Like Mr. Rogers' always said. "Look for the helpers..." look at the people opening their doors in such a scary time. Look at our police and armed forces risking and life and limb to keep us safe. There is always helpers, give them your praise. Stand with the victims. Be better than your enemy.
I live in Paris and I don't know what to say. I'm so fucking sad and angry
Slightly off topic, but it's times like these that I realize the value that reddit provides.  Virtually every other major news organization has its stories on this locked down for comments because of crazies, so this is one of the few open discussion threads on the internet about this.

(They've also got an open discussion thread at breitbart, but the discussion there is . . . well, predictable, at least.)
this incident reminds me of the Mumbai attacks in 2008, Definitely highly organised and coordinated. hope it is nowhere near as bloody.
As a french, fuck, not again..

EDIT: I have a relative in the area, but he's safe though close. 

EDIT2: He's safe now. My thoughts to the victims.
Actually sounds like fighters have been scrambled here.  East anglia UK
**For those asking why Paris/France:**

France has the largest population of Muslims in the European Union--with up to 15% of the Paris Metropolitan Area (around 1.7Million)-- many of whom are disaffected Islamic youth.

Immigrant Muslims in France generally live under poor conditions and feel like second class citizens.^1 This has already led to a number of violent clashes in recent years, such as the [French Riots of 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_French_riots).

Prisons in France are now majority Muslim -- [between 60-70%](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11352268/What-is-going-wrong-in-Frances-prisons.html) (!) -- which means that Islamic radicalization is going on in a wholly separated society, without any attempt to provide alternative to that ideology.^2

That, and the ongoing cultural clash between French nationals and new immigrants makes for a prime recruiting and organizing ground for terrorism.

See, also:     
  
* ["Is France failing its Muslim youths?"](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/14/france-islamophobiaimmigration.html) (Al Jazerra):
&amp;nbsp;
&gt;He explained that radical groups recruit young Muslims by tapping into their feelings of anger and hopelessness, which are often born out of years-long disenfranchisement. The groups market an agenda of defending an Islam that is ostensibly under attack by the state. He said such disillusioned youth are more susceptible to being persuaded to join a “bigger cause.”

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;    
&gt;Madani Cheurfa, an academic at Sciences Po in Paris, argues that the widespread availability of the internet also differentiates young Muslims from their parents, providing an open channel for those who, often frustrated and feeling rejected by their own country, discover extreme religious views that address their alienation and criticise their parents’ way of life.

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;    
&gt;Nearly everyone agreed that the fallout from the Charlie Hebdo attacks, including a heightened security response by France and its allies, was a distraction from a larger problem: a sense of increasing social and economic marginalization that many cited as a root cause of young people drifting toward extremism.

SIXTY hostages?? Oh fuck 
This is looking to be a huge attack. 
Please stop sharing info about police raids on here. This might bite the hostages in the ass.
My Mum and aunt are there can someone please tell me of there is a number I can call to register for information? No response on Facebook or text
Edit: Thank you everybody, I have called the Australian embassy and am waiting patiently. 
Police raid is done in Bataclan, 2 terrorists dead
BBC reporter sinking to the depths of Kay Burleigh. He seriously asked an obviously shaken witness from the bar if he could the bodies and to describe them. Witness said he'd rather not and interview ended but that left a really bad taste in my mouth. 

Edit because it was pointed out that I missed a word. He asked if he could see the bodies and describe them. Sorry!
I couldn't fucking imagine being in this situation. Families and innocent people enjoying their Friday night not hurting anyone , then this. 

I'm in US but this is making me want to cry right now, I wish I could hug my family now just because.

I hope this gets resolved quickly and no more have to die. Stay strong, France.
I know it's wayyy too early to mention this, but if it turns out these terrorists entered Europe amidst all the refugees, there is going to be a shit storm. 
I'm afraid the death toll will be three digits come morning.

I have no words for this. I do notice in my reactions that I am being far more 'right-winged' than I actually am. The terrorists win again as far as that is concerned. I want to give all the refugees coming into the EU help, but right now I just think we (the Netherlands, but the entire EU really) should close the borders and care only about our citizens. And that thought makes me sad too because it sounds terrible and selfish as well.
Shooting at Louvre. Famous Dutch guy (who's not the joking-around kind of famous) got a text from a girl he knows who's there. 
It has to be ISIS.  I'm Lebanese-American, and just earlier today there was an enormous suicide attack in a Shiite neighborhood close to where my grandparents live in Beirut.  They really are a global scourge.  I don't even know how to handle this.  I'm just gonna go bury myself in a bottle of whiskey.
I'm not sure how to get the people running the live stream to see this, but: 

**Please don't show pictures of police preparing to act. In the off chance the shooters are monitoring these feeds, you do not want to put lives in any more danger than they already are.**

/u/Nuage0 et al.     
Apologies if this seems trivial or tangential to anyone, but...

At Bataclan theatre where there's currently a hostage situation, Eagles Of Death Metal were performing tonight. How could anyone possibly predict going to an Eagles Of Death Metal gig on a Friday night in Paris would end up in a life-threatening hostage situation? Young people celebrating together the joy of music. Killed for nothing.

I want our fucking world back.
I've been saying it for the last couple years...this is the style of terrorist attack we are going to see more of in the West. Mumbai and Nairobi Mall (and the last Paris attack) proved that a small group with only a little bit of funding and planning and a willingness to die can absolutely wreak havoc and cause fear and panic with nothing more than small arms...explosives just make it that much worse. Those attacks were all successes. 

These frustrating retarded assholes are just terrific at attacking unarmed civilians. I'm shocked we haven't seen an absolute outbreak of this in the US and elsewhere yet, despite the number of gun-carrying citizens we have. I remember getting my conceal/carry permit a couple years ago worried about crime in my neighborhood. But now these days there's a voice in the back of my head that I'm arming up to fight back against something like this. 

Fuck this shit. I love Paris and hope this ends soon. I'm sorry for the victims, their families and everyone else who has to go through this. 
My parents are staying in Paris at Hôtel Les Dames du Panthéon, 19 place du Panthéon - 75005 Paris - But I'm in the US and I don't know how to get in contact with them. Any suggestions would be great, they are not responding to facebook or texts right now.

EDIT: THANK YOU FOR THE OUTREACH. PEOPLE ARE LOVELY. My parents were at the Eiffel Tower and apparently didn't even know anything was going on. They are on their way back to the hotel now. Thanks again! Prayers for everyone's family and friends. Viva la France!
I wan't to wake up one day...one day. Weather it be tomorrow or when it's the morning of the day I die. 

I wan't to wake up, knowing that something like this will never happen. It saddens me to know that these events will be mourned for a month or two at most, and then *poof* back to our lives.

Last year 145 people (132 kids) had been killed in a Pakistani public school by the hands of demons like these. My cousin was one of them. I try not to think about it, but it's hard to do when an event like this happens.

The event was remembered for a month at the most by the media, but will be remembered by the victims parents for the rest of their lives.

My hands are shaking as I type this with an emotion that can only be described as an intense hybrid of rage and sorrow.

I still hope for the day I wake up, and this all "goes away".
My SO was having drinks very close to where a shooting happened. She heard the rifles. Cops are everywhere. No uber, no taxi. She can't get home.
I'm an hour away from Paris and can't get back now. Fuck, this is a shitty day. I just hope she'll get home safely.

And the death toll is rising. Mes condoléances aux familles des victimes. We gotta stand united. Thanks reddit for your messages.

Edit : she made it safely to my friend's place. Lucikly, it seems all my friends and family are safe now. Thanks guys for your messages, very touching. Means a lot.
No, please, not again. The French have had so much to endure...
Dear ISIS: You will not frighten the world into making huge military mistakes and screwing ourselves into financial ruin. You will not terrorize us and therefor you fail. Every single disgustingly inhumane thing you do only makes us stronger and have more resolve to rid the world of you.

One of these days you're going to really piss someone off, like wanting a war with Russia, and they really have no problem taking some collateral civilian deaths to get you. If you take one step over a line you will be bombed into carbon.

You've pissed off the entire world to the point where the ROE would be shoot on sight. And don't be surprised out of nowhere a bunch of bombs fall on you from a big black triangle in the night that you can't see, much less shoot at. 

French Citizens: I'm sorry, it's an awful, tragic day. But please, do the same thing you did after CH, show the entire world you won't be bullied. 
Holy shit, wtf...

My friend has 2 people she knows who were at the concert where supposedly the hostage situation is happening, they are not picking up their phones...

edit: They are all fine. 
Why is that car upside down? Car bomb? 
Why is the news station still showing live images from the police operation?  
Haven't they learned anything?  
You can see they're building a squad at a corner, if the terrorists have a phone they can see that too
Someone just said: "It says "I'm still in Bataclan. Badly injured ! They have to raid the place asap. There are survivors inside. They are executing everyone. One by one. 1st floor quickly !!!!"

There are 20k comments so no one will see this but a jerk from the USA is heartbroken over this.  Stay strong, France 
As a Mumbaikar who stayed up throughout the 3 days during which they scarred my beloved city, I understand your pain, your fear, your sorrow and your outrage. This is like reliving the massacre in Mumbai and I'm shaking and fighting tears. Please know that my prayers and thoughts are with you. Courage. Viva la France.
Just as they stood with us during 9/11, America stands with France today. Sending prayers to all those affected.

BBC already drawing conclusions between this shooting and the reports of the death of Jihadi John.
40 dead, French national press says. 
Hollande live :  State of emergency and borders closed.... Here we go guys.
Special numbers set up to get information on family that might be in the city.

**Foreign office (for British nationals):** 020-7008-1500

**Dublin - for Irish nationals:** 00-3531-408-2000

Heard on SkyNews. It was stressed these aren't general purpose numbers, they are for inquiries about relatives in the city who are British or Irish.
I've gotta applaud the mods of /r/worldnews for not censoring literally every new comment unlike the fuckwits at /r/news 
Oh for fucks sake this is just sickening. From the USA, my heart goes out to the people of France. This is an act of war and whoever is responsible they can die a slow and painful death. Fucking animals...hell they are worse than animals, they are just cowardly pieces of human filth. Goddamn this is upsetting. 
I know this will most likely get buried but does anyone know of any French foundations that I could donate to in order to help? Thank you guys and my thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families.

Respect from England. I feel for France as strong as I feel for my own country. Man, so sad
A CNN reporter tweeted that Putin will work with the US on the situation. I suspect this attack with ultimately lead to the downfall of ISIS

Looking like the worst terrorist event in France's modern history now.

Death toll rising above 40, and still ~100 hostages we don't know about.
In France, a state of emergency means the president can:


    Regulate or forbid circulation and gathering in some areas (including by the use of curfew)
    Close places of gathering
    Conduct house-to-house searches at any time without judicial oversight
    Censorship

Really bad news for Syrian refugees if this is true.
Parisiens are using the hashtag #PorteOuverte for those who need shelter in Paris right now.
God dammit, why Paris? Such a beautiful city full of culture attacked time and time again.
Hey guys, my brother and his friend are studying overseas in Paris.

My brother is not from that area and is currently safe, but no one can get a hold of his friend (who was in that area tonight.) If anyone finds a list of confirmed wounded or deceased would you mind sending it my way please?

Thank you.
The end goal of this is to recruit Muslims in France. There's gonna be a huge crackdown as a result of this. People in France are going to be more hostile towards Muslims. Those Muslims who are harassed are more likely to join with extremists. The whole point is to create a divide in the population. Split the population between Muslims and non-Muslims and turn it into a religious war. 
To the people who monitor ISIS websites &amp; Twitter feeds, what are they saying about this? I'm curious if they will take responsibility. 
French people, we are with you. Stay safe and hide. We Indians witnessed a similar gruesome tragedy back in 2008 Mumbai attacks, and it is shocking to see the same thing happening again in Paris.

This attack is fucking sick. I hope survivors stay safe. This is not your everyday terrorist attack people, this is a full scale geopolitical shit these retarded terrorists have dared to stir.

I was calmly taking my morning breakfast and preparing to sleep as I had to stay up all night...and then I read this news. What the actual fuck. I am thoroughly shocked. Cannot even sleep now.
The French president just announced that it was done by ISIS.

Confirmed
I feel sick to my stomach. Deepest thoughts to the families.

ISIS is a cancer to humanity. There are no others words.
Holy fuck this shit is getting old.

Can't we all just live and let live for fuck's sake?

Translation (my french isn't that good): I'm still in the concert house, first floor, heavly wounded. There are other survivors here as well. They are shooting everyone. One by one. First floor fast!!!! (call for help)   


This shit makes me sick.. Hope these guys make it out.
Anyone in the area, for the survivors....the hospitals will likely be needing blood donors.   Donate if you can.
Interview on CNN summary:

1 - The person interviewing was inside "It was a blood bath:
2 - People were stepping over people trying to escape
3 - the shooters were QUIET (one was young, 20years old), they were saying NOTHING.
4 - Shooters were UNMASKED, were CALM, reloaded.
5 - They were shooting in random directions, still MANY HOSTAGES inside
6 - His friend is still stuck inside, texting him, saying police has NOT entered yet.


They need to get into that theater. That's not a hostage situation.

French police ask to not post location information about the police's movements, Wolf Blitzer and CNN trying to connect with eye witness outside of theater to describe what's happening regarding police's movements. We have to change our media. 
Please be safe. My brother has been in Paris for business and has been missing for several hours now
Holy fuck...The guy who produced my band's first release has been shot and killed...I can't believe it. Fuck this shit. This just isn't fair.

I usually troll worldnews but for real, this is fucked. Here's to hoping this shit gets wrapped up quick and it doesn't happen again. Stay safe  our French friends. USA got your back.
Reports of "huge explosions" and automatic gun fire from within the concert hall with the hostages after military stormed it. If true the death toll is going to rise significantly. 
It may not mean much right now, but our thoughts and hearts are with you France. Stand strong and know that we stand with you here in America. 
For whatever it's worth to anyone who may read this: my heart breaks for you Paris, but the world stands with you.
Please Note From CNN: Americans in Paris are being asked to contact the embassy so they can account for them. This will help families which are looking for their family members!
I'm fucking shaking right now. As a frenchman, I'm secretly hoping this is not another terror attack.

Worst year for France in ages.
CNN: Hostages texting that they are being killed 1-by-1. Begging for police raid.
Sadly, I believe incidents like this will become more common. Islamic fanaticism isn't going away. It is no longer confined to a specific geographical area. It is no longer confined to a specific ethnic group.
CNN Still reporting on bataclan, although gag is in place.

Fuck
Just fucking stop. Cowards, all of them. 
An attack of this scale will surely receive some serious military response, right? This is on another level from the January attacks.
If Muslims condemned ISIS as much as Israel, there wouldn't be an ISIS. I'm tired of people saying that this is only a small extremist element. A whole organization is literally terrorizing the world and people are so quick to dismiss it as a "few extremists". There is a lot of sympathy towards ISIS within Islam and in terms of fighting it only a few regional  minority groups are making a difference. The Muslim world needs to make a far greater effort to combat and discouraged extremists  and ISIS, instead countries like Saudi Arabia are fueling it. I know Islam is a huge religion, but the voice of reason within it sure as hell isnt as loud as the roar of hate. 
My friends daughter is staying at this XXXXX

Quran 2:191-193 "And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing...
but if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)"

Quran 3:151 "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority".

Quran 3:56 "As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help."

Clearly, the doctrine of Islam supports religious violence. Stating this fact is taboo, offensive, controversial, and considered to be bigotry. Obviously it shouldn't be, especially after this tragedy. Even if you are able to "reinterpret" these (and many more) passages to mean something more benign, it should still be apparent that not all muslims do the same - as evidenced by all of the senseless killings occurring in the name of allah. I don't know how to stop jihad, but I do know that we will never get to that point if we can't even bring ourselves to honestly describe what is happening. Muslim extremists are not extreme in how they interpret their religious texts. They are actually just doing what the book says. The only thing extreme about this are the words in the Quran, and the fact that a human being is actually capable of living by those words. Any person or idea that is immune to criticism has the potential to be very dangerous. Islam falls into this category. These jihadists TRULY believe that they are doing the right thing. Can we admit that beliefs guide behaviors? Can we admit that the plethora of terror attacks we have in this world are the RESULT of true belief in the canon of Islam? People are DYING and we are so worried about hurting feelings that we won't even let ourselves TALK openly about the root of the problem.
Worst possible thing we could do right now is to have live cameras and news reports on tactical movements of police / army towards the hostages. 
My heart goes out to everyone in Paris right now... I wish I could be there to help you.. Love from Philadelphia. PA USA

I just heard what seemed to be gunshots in the 15th district. 

It sounded pretty far but it was the only noise at this time (7am).

Anybody has any insight on that? 
Reminds me of Mumbai attacks(26/11).

Stay strong Paris.
It's sickening to think that one of our closest allies is in a state of emergency yet we can only provide so much to attempt to heal the wounds that can't be healed. Donations and funds can only stretch so far as lives are irreplaceable and families are devastated, and nothing we can do will ever be able to bring those that lost their lives back, the lives of those that were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Stay safe everyone, be it in France or anywhere around the world. A tragedy should not tear us at the seams but rather bring us all together.
Here's the full quote:

&gt; People want to lead a peaceful lives. The terrorists are short-sighted, and this is one of the causes of rampant suicide bombings. We cannot solve this problem only through prayers. I am a Buddhist and I believe in praying. But humans have created this problem, and now we are asking God to solve it. It is illogical. God would say, solve it yourself because you created it in the first place.

&gt;We need a systematic approach to foster humanistic values, of oneness and harmony. If we start doing it now, there is hope that this century will be different from the previous one. It is in everybody's interest. So let us work for peace within our families and society, and not expect help from God, Buddha or the governments.
Good guy Dalai  Lama: Leads a major world religion, pushes logic over prayers to solve world issues.
&gt;Have faith in God, but row away from the rocks. - Hunter Thompson 
I had to post this to balance the discussion a little bit, it's a bit troubling to see so many people focused on 'wiping them all out' and 'we need to pray for everyone, not just Paris'.
reminds me of this quote: Albert Einstein — 'The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.'
Did he say anything about likes on Facebook? Those still help, right? 
That sounds like a lot of effort. Can't I just "like" something?
James 2:14-17 

What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
Reminds me of the touching, out-of-context [quote](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Brother_Martin) from *Oblivion*:

&gt;Remember when we first met in Kvatch? I told you that I didn't want any part of the gods' plan. I still don't know if there is a divine plan. But I've come to realize that it doesn't matter. What matters is that we act. That we do what's right, when confronted with evil. That's what you did at Kvatch. It wasn't the gods that saved us, it was you. Were you acting for the gods? I don't know. But now it's my turn to act.
To be fair, it's probably the governments that created this. So working for peace means, at least on some level, getting the governments to fix this. 
What does he mean by "work for peace"? A lot of ISIS soldiers are gonna have to die before order is restored to Syria and Iraq.
The attitudes and willingness to resist violence among *individuals* really is all that matters. The attacks in France demonstrate that a single person can cause unbelievable amounts of pain and agony. We cannot prevent it absolutely, and efforts to do so will degrade our freedom until there's hardly anything worth protecting left because we would have ceded everything to a different group of authoritarians at home. We should defend ourselves individually and collectively to mitigate our risk, but we have to reject preemptive violence, regime change around the world, and dropping bombs on any number of innocents.
It's ok, changed my Facebook profile to have the French flag. Done my part! 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUEGHdQO7WA. Please watch and share. It might be old but its still relevant today... more than ever. We need more of this to solve this problem. Its the only way
You're trying to tell me changing my profile pic to Colgate paste colors doesn't do anything? fucking religious fanatics
"Gunga Galunga"
Do we really need the Dalai Lama to tell us this? 

If so, then I'm afraid the problem is far worse, because we have lost the capability of thinking for ourselves.
No shit sherlock
Good guy Dalai Lama: Leads a major world religion, pushes logic over prayers to solve world issues.


As someone who has been practicing meditation for four years an hour+ daily, I can't speak more highly of a practice that can show us true peace within ourselves - not so much a peace drug-blanket but more of calming awareness within the storming changes of life. Unfortunately, it is one of the few things in life that can only be understood through direct practice yet ultimately the practice itself becomes an obstacle.

We have to become self aware if we are going to solve the problem of peace. Suffering is caused by delusion. It's time for humanity to wake up to the true divinity of each mysterious moment unfolding. If we don't get our shit together, we may not get to experience the potential of what humanity could become.

True being. Here. Now. Heaven is here. Divinity is here. But it all sounds preachy and culty and new agey and garbage, which is all the beautiful paradox of meditation. We can't get into this practice until the practice is ready for us. Then we practice until there is no more practice and life begins anew where it always was, right here and now in front of our faces. Being with the changing mystery, regardless of being, will help humanity achieve the true status of human **being.**
**Praying is the laziest reaction**, just like closing your eyes when you want something to go away or not see it. Praying is only good for the believer to repeat the religious rhetoric in their heads. It's possibly comforting the praying person, but it's not helping anyone.

If I have dirty dishes in my kitchen, I can pray as hard as I want, they won't do themselves. The whole world can pray, nothing would happen.  
And that's why #PrayforParis is a bad hashtag. Not only is the terror based on religion, also there are likely some atheists killed and praying is just not fitting for them.

Secularize your thoughts.
I saw an actual tweet the other day that said something to the effect of "I hope people pray for Paris instead of just tweeting about it." Oy. We need more of the Dalai Lama's sanity.
That sounds like a good start to me.
"Pray to God, but row for shore." 

An old Russian sailor's proverb. 
I'm all in favor of doing something against ISIS, I just hope we don't get as stupid about this as we did 9/11. Which is really all this is, the French version of 9/11.

You know how you solve ISIS? You use that expensive intelligence spying, and you pinpoint where high-end leaders of the organization are and kill them. From there they'd splinter and disintegrate. It's how they solve gangs, why wouldn't it work on terrorists?

More importantly there's plenty of terrorism outside of ISIS. Maybe not as flashy. Ninjas with squiggly line flags look like video game terrorists, as opposed to Mark Zuckerberg making a cold billion off the backs of a retarded consumer base committing fraud and embezzlement, or Google just outright evading their taxes but creating an economic sinkhole.

If you think terrorism is a bunch of poor brown people who can strap a bomb to themselves, your family deserved what they got to wake you the fuck up. ISIS was the direct result of intervention in Arabic countries and the murdering of secular regimes like Saddam Hussein and Gadhafi. So it's disgusting to watch Westerners cry their crocodile tears while 90% of all the ills in the world are at least indirectly their own fault.
What a useless comment. Sorry for being so abrupt. But what would he have us do? Be specific. The politicans are saying we need to bomb the middle east, but is that really the solution?
Religion has created this problem, you can't ask religion to fix it.
Despite all my rage I am still just a pacifist sage.
Amen.

Oh shit, fucked that up again.
Even a peacefull monk is tired of isis shit ...
Peace activists didn't liberate Auschwitz. Military persons did.
This is like a Ghandi moment in Civ: 

"Dalai Lama : This shit is fucked. Fuck up their shit."

*20 nukes detected*
That is the most polite way to say "Some people just need killin'." that I've ever seen.


what exactly is he suggesting we do now?
Sounds like rhetoric. What's his plan? What's his solution? 
So he basically has admitted that "God" doesn't help with anything, ever. 

Finally. 
Cool story Lama. 
I thought Buddhists didn't have a god that was prayed to?
Let's solve this problem, [motherfucker](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_AIyYZZwhGsk/THboPSsWZnI/AAAAAAAABMc/frgnnIhvBCs/s1600/Cheech.jpg)
What if the enemy is highly inhumane and not even remotely logical or willing to talk peace?

In those intense situations I'd like to think a well aimed cruise missile (or two, or three) helps.
So kill them all.
This is his way of saying "shoot every terrorist in the fucking head"
Dalai Lama knows that prayers only help the person who prays. That's why it was invented in the first place.

Whenever somebody needs help don't offer your prayers. Offer your fucking help. That helps.
Translation: "Give 'em hell"
I agree. Broadcast free Star Trek over there and let Picard sort them out. 
This is the best thing that a religious person of great importance could have said. It's time for people to stop using religion as a crutch/excuse/etc., and start taking actions. Deity of choice did not do this to our world. We did this to our world. 
I've been on an unmerciful tangent on this exact subject on facebook for the last 48 hours, so nice to be ahead of the Dalai Lama on this one. Makes all the PTSD effects every time I go to check it worth something.
I'm pretty sure prayer has never ever EVER worked, it's nice to know he's not delusional in thinking you can pray the issue away.
I wonder if this, at all, offends Buddhists that have devoted their lives to prayer. 
My brain read "demi lovato". Was confused. I need to go to bed now.

To put it another way...

"Trust in Allah, but tie your camel." - Old Muslim saying
DL bringing the real heat.  
Gunga lagunga.
Kick them where it hurts...seize their cell phones, money and don't pray for them.  
Dude's right. Shit, am late for work!!
Not to mention, you can pray to whoever you want to stop the madness, but why would your god save those who don't and will never believe in his power? Also, according to the Christian God, this world belongs to the evil one until Jesus comes back so expect evil to run rampant. Can't ask him to stop what he allowed when we don't understand the end game. 

Thats like a kid wanting to go home during errands but what the kid didn't  know, is that mom was finally heading to the arcade for the rest of the day. Mom dosen't take kid home, she drives silently until the destination is reached and the kid can see the end with his own eyes. Mom=god. Any god. They all have the same premise: Get your shit together so you don't harm your neighbor physically or emotionally and if you follow the book of that god you will be rewarded with somthing or other in life and death.

Just a thought though.
 
Based on his proven track record in regard to delivering on requests, I wouldn't rely on God to do shit!
That's convenient. 
I strongly encourage anyone and everyone to learn about the Buddhist faith and principles no matter what religion or belief system you hold.  This is "a big deal"  and "powerful words" for a lot of people,  to a studying Bhudists these are basic principles, as infantile as addition and subtraction... It's sad that we have all strayed so far from the noble path in this world. 

Even here,  a major religious figurehead is trying to give the world a gateway into thier belief system and several fundamental principles they hold as steps on the path of peace and happiness and enlightenment(selflessness, ,  right action,  right intention,  right effort,  etc, all depicted in a few short paragrpahs) and more directly a tried and true formula on how to operate and make the world better and.... and half the comment section is Dalai Lama jokes and bickering.
changing fb pic is not enough.. we must change ourselfs..
Ya cant make peace with those that don't want it. They want to kill and destroy, and they will continue to do so. 
God's a bit of an arsehole really. *Sure* he won't solve a problem that we created. Okay then. Fair enough. 

What about earthquakes and shit though bro? Last I checked he didn't quite help out there either. Didn't come down and start resurfacing the tarmac or help sweep the roads clear. Seems a bit absent throughout tbf...

I rate the Dalai Lama above god for helpfulness. At least he actively calls for some action.
I agree prayer without action is useless. 
"Some" humans created this problem. Ftfy lama. 
Current Muslim figures, like Hamza Yusuf, have great quotes like this, but it looks like they won't be heard like this one.
And we'll listen because his work for peace in Tibet was such a smashing success.
As a person who believes in God but doesn't agree with the business of religion, It's nice to know I'm not the only person who thinks like this. My friends would always say to me if there was a God why would he allow suffering and bad things to happen in the world.

 I would say I believe we have free will and some people are evil for whatever reasons, childhood, drug abuse etc... take your pick. But blaming God who grants free will is stupid, that's the whole point of free will. You can do good in life and help others or you can cause pain and suffering. You have to take responsibility for your actions. Don't blame God if you never do anything to help yourself or help to solve the problems in the world.

People are starving around the world and dying of curable diseases because most of us are to worried about ourselves and our families. What doesn't effect us personally we just offer love, prayer and hope but no real work to help others.

Most people in their lives are chasing  money, status, and their own happiness. Could you imagine if as a human race we actually cared about one another? We made doctor's  the movie stars/athletes  of our society. Instead we chase empty materialistic items and try to one up each other. It's something  we are all guilty of and whether or not you believe in God, I think we can all agree that we should be doing more for each other. 

It's almost 6am and I need sleep so I'm sorry if my message is randomly stated, I hope you understand  what I'm trying to say. Good night all 


Why does the Dalai Lama always have to be right about everything? 
God I love this man.Bless him.
Just think of how shitty a group you must be for the fucking Dalai Lama to be okay with people taking you out by force
What exactly does he suggest we do in our daily lives to prevent coordinated full-scale terror attacks performed by well-funded, highly organized groups?...

We all supposed to apply for jobs at the CIA?
"I'll pray for you."

What an awesome way to feel like you've helped while actually you've done nothing.
I'm out in Israel doing volunteer work- teaching disadvantaged children, bedouin tribes and adults English. 

I have a lot of people I talk to, and normally it's catching up. But now and again I get something along the lines of, 'I wish I could do something like that...' and I think to myself. No you don't. Because if you honestly did, you would.

I came here penniless, and I don't earn a cent doing anything here.

And then I get some messages on my feed which are along the lines of, 'I'm praying for people out there,' as if that will do anything at all to solve bigotry or promote peace.

If you want to see good done, honest good, you have to put yourself in the situation in a way that can promote well being.

It reminds me of this girl I used to date and her father. One day I lost my wallet in a rough part of town where a bunch of gangs (primarily MS13) hung around. A week later a twelve year old shows up and gives me my wallet at my home, and everything is inside it. She had found it seven hours after I lost it apparently. She literally had gotten her mother to drive her everyday to my home until she ran into me so she could hand it back to me.

That weekend I got it back I was at my gf's house and her father says this, 'I was praying to God you would find your wallet.' and he had the smuggest look on his face. At the time I was pretty anti-religious,  and I'm still fairly critical but still. HIS prayer got me my wallet back? Fuck off.

That little girl was who got me it back, who took the time out of her schedule to do good.

Praying does nothing but assuage the person praying that they are somehow doing something, when they know they aren't. It's like a way to cast off guilt or sadness, or anger, or whatever.

It's stupid. And I think it does more harm than anything, because it placates people into thinking they've done something when they have done nothing.

The only prayer worth saying, is one of thanks. Anything else is special pleading to make the person praying feel better. And that's fine- but seriously, don't pray and think you're doing anything for anyone through it.
I guess he won't be running for the Republican nomination.l 
translation:  "We are fucked."
Is this the Dalai Lama's way of saying "blow those fuckers up?"
Or maybe Dalai Lama is a nobody, and his opinions are no better or worse than those of the average person.
My dad once gave me a white napkin with dalai lamas signature on it.

I was too young to know who he was.... Now its gone.

Every time i read something about dalai lama i feel bad, and i should feel bad.

I remember my dads face with a look of confusion of why i am not showing any appreciation to what he just handed me.
Killing got us into this mess, and more killing is the answer?

Mankind sure does suck sometimes!

I want to be a dolphin in the next life.
This quote will be on Facebook in 10 minutes. 1 like = 1 prayer. 
The Dalai Lama getting it straight again, this guy. This guy.
Hmm, God and Buddha don't exist so $400,000 to train mercenaries to fight the Chinese in CIA training centers seems like a practical solution. Too bad it's fucking Buddhists and they're wasting their money on veritable idiots.
It's strange for me to agree with a religious man words, but I completely agree with this *So let us work for peace ... and not expect help from God, Buddha or the governments.* I'll just add an "ever" between "not" and "expect".
In short: time to kick some ass.
But this is America! The only solution to all of our problems is God or Government.
It's very settling that prominent religious leaders around the world, are adapting to modern times and not sticking to ultra religious practices to spread positive messages, which no matter what religion you adhere to, you're still able to agree with them. 
A wise man has spoken. Listen world. 
"Praying will not work. We need guns" -Dalai Lama
A man of religion willing to take the consequences of his own actions rather than blame everything on god? 

Impressive but extremely contradictory to everything he believes in and preaches.
If said God could create anything it fucking wants I don't see how it's difficult for it to stop a handful of apes from going full retard.
I kind of take this to mean that: sure if I get cancer I'm going to pray about it, but I'm sure as hell going to the doctor to get treatment. 
"Two hands working can accomplish more than a dozen clasped in prayer"
you know the future is here when even the Dalai lama says enough with with the hastag prayers bs.
"but humans created this problem"

correction: humans who created religion created this problem
A wise but hopeless statement. Human stupidity will never be solved.
&gt;If you consider others as brothers and sisters and respect their rights, then there is no room for violence.
Who does he pray to ? 
I think he's trying to make sure nobody starts thinking just because they have faith means they should rely on it to fix these problems. Sounded more like a 'heed this' than 'stop what you are doing' kind of phrase.

I am probably more to the right than a lot of people, but, it is clear to me that we are not going to be able to defeat this through sheer force, or violence. For those of you who say "Just kill them all! We have to wipe "these people" out!" etc. etc. Are you REALLY willing to kill a billion people to get rid of this? And, do you REALLY think that someone else won't like you? After a while, it will just be you and a few people who think (thought) like you, who eventually will turn on you, because they disagree with you. I am not saying we should turn the other cheek all the time, or that we should not fight this evil, but, it should be obvious to a thinking person that we are not going to get rid of all of this through force alone.
Oh good.  I've been on a roll tonight.  I am so fucking pissed about the climate of the global refugee talks right now that I could shit fire.  We need to help these people, not shut them out.  I have a basement and a garage.  Bring it on politicians.  [Started a petition thingy for USA](http://wh.gov/iVjvi)  WeThePeople.org and all that.  
well he doesn't like this buddhist atittude:

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-burma-aung-san-suu-kyi-60-minutes/

&gt;When you think of Buddhism, you're likely to think of peace and tranquility. So we were surprised to know some of the biggest inciters of violence against the Rohingya are Buddhist monks.

&gt;One of the most outspoken and influential is Sayadaw Ashin Wirathu. He is anything but peaceful and tranquil. Listen to what he said to us.

&gt;**Bill Whitaker: The Dalai Lama has condemned your form of Buddhism as extremism.**

&gt;**Ashin Wirathu: I accept the term extremist with pride. I do not respect the Dalai Lama. He's a political power broker. The Dalai Lama is not honorable to me.**

&gt;Wirathu's rhetoric is extreme, but his mantra -- that Burma is for Buddhists - is widely held, even by other holy men. He's a provocateur, who enflames passions with fiery speeches. He's attracted a large and growing following.

&gt;Bill Whitaker: Do Muslims have a place here in Burma?

&gt;We can't repeat his actual response, it's R-rated. But essentially he said Muslims were defecating on Burma; threatening its very existence.

&gt;Ashin Wirathu: I don't accept them.

&gt;Bill Whitaker: Why?

&gt;Ashin Wirathu: Because they're deceiving the world they want to take over the whole country. But even then they will not be satisfied. They will only be satisfied when the whole world converts to Islam.

I think governments have a role. What is government but the coordination of resources and energy toward a common goal?
We can bomb ISIS with compassion, they will get their 72 virgins and go to paradise, everyone wins!
Classic God. Always causing shit, but never cleaning up the mess.
Amen. 

It's easy to see how ISIS is funded and constructed by the world's financial elite (our own military and government has literally confirmed this)

World governments are attempting to use fear and propaganda of media to drive a war against Syria that we simply don't need to be having. 

This is WHY they are so eager to take away our internet freedom, our freedom of speech, and shit, even I'll say it, promote gun control. 

We can NOT be pawned into a proxy war to kill civilians in numbers that make the 120-200 killed in these massacres look like child's play. 

The refugees are escaping these attacks in Syria only to have the media blame them for more potential terror. 

It's 100% ILLOGICAL. All of these dots connect and we're at substantial risk of, to quote the pope, World War 3. 

The best thing we can do is promote the downplay of mass government spending, the war on Syria, the mainstream media being pawned into promoting widespread fear and terror, and become A PEOPLE OF PEACE. 

Who's with me? 

Please watch this:

Pretty sure religion caused this problem.
I've always wondered if the Dalai Lama is really a pragmatic atheist. He sure doesn't act like any religious figure I ever heard of.

For all the people saying the Dalai Lama is great guy, maybe you'd like to know the fact that he accepted around a million dollars from the CIA to fund tibetan guerilla operations against the chinese.

Maybe he really is a great guy fighting an evil regime, but I feel like this runs pretty hard against his anti violence sentiments and seems rather hypocritical.
If prayer worked, no one would be sick, and everyone would have money. 
Oh, well that's not so tough.......
Very libertarian of him.
Well thought out words, from someone whose words actually do something.
Lovely sentiment except that those who are responsible only want to kill. They can not be bargained with. 
I saw the Dalai Lama at Dulles in DC a long time ago. He had an entourage of exactly one person, a woman. He was the kind of person you like just by looking at him. He isn't in the business of gathering votes; he just speaks undeniable truth. Even the Pope manages to piss a lot of folks off, and I am not one of them, or even a Catholic. I am nothing. But I like their message, and I like that they both stand in line like the rest of us.

Politicians don't do that.

TLDR: The Dalai Lama and the Pope are the Bernie Sanders of religion.
It's simple, we glass the Middle East.
ISIS are not interested in peace, they want us all to die.

Religion is exactly why most of the bullshit in the world is happening. Because you can't reason with religion. As there is no common ground. You don't need religion to be a good person.
I've only been thinking about this for a few days, but it seems like this  change must come from within the Muslim faith. We must put political pressure on them to reign in this element. Worldwide political pressure on the Muslim faith and the internal dialogue must be transparent and public. They will either back up their claims of peacefulness or expose violent doctrine.
Christian here, stop asking God to fix your problems and stop blaming God for all your problems. I feel like this everyday. I'm 22 i fucked up in HS and in life in general being a lazy ass ,playing videogames all day ,smoking weed, and trying to "fuck white girls". Everything I did in life is my fault. God isn't going to hand me anything , God isn't going to make me get good grades. I'm thankful for what I have but of I want something I need to work for it. 
Well I can't bomb the shit out of sand people without the government's help.

Atheists across Reddit cream their pants after reading that title.
I can't wait to see this printed over the top of some picture of a mist shrouded mountain in my Facebook feed in about an hour's time. 
Well.... If there is no God this makes great sense.  If there is a God, then it is a false dilemma.  Why not pray and act for peace?
I saw the dali lama when he visited Seattle, he talks so much more reasonable than most of the world
i think honestly muslims should report other muslims for radical behaviour, how could that even happen in the west without someone reporting it i dont know
I'm a Christian and I agree with this. I believe in the power of prayer but I realize that God often works through us and that simply praying is not ever enough. It's an old joke, but I like the one about the man who's trapped on a roof during a flood and repeatedly refuses help whilst praying to God then gets upset at God when he dies while God was answering his prayer and sending help. I think too often we pray for miracles, like God's hand to come out of the sky and just swat away these evil people.

The Dalai Lama uses the word "only" which is powerful here, suggesting that there's nothing wrong with prayer but to also do more than simply pray in private and think that's enough to help the situation. What that is, depends on each individual in their own way depending on what they feel is right to do in this situation.

I think this should extend to more problems as well. I think Christians and other praying-believers see someone in need and rather than directly help that person, they just pray for them. Cool, but we should do more than simply leave everything in God's hands for some supernatural miracle to happen.
Well continuing to bomb the Middle East since a long time, committing acts of their own lives and choose to ignore their civic duties.
Deities don't exist, if so we would have witnessed their power in humans crucial time of need. People should have known we'd have to change this from the start. Weak people believe in a deity because they underestimate themselves.
Experiment:  sit in a room 1:1 with a jihadi and 'work for peace'.  See just how far you get.
Missiles is the only way to fix this ignorance. 
Lmao... Not wait for help from God, implying that God ever helped anyone anywhere. 
But... prayers are the best way of feeling good without doing nothing!
A load of hot air that means fuck all. 
Actually, no I think god is part of the problem here.  You can't really do things logically when people believe the invisible sky man wants them to kill people.
maybe because god isn't real. 
Use logic to solve our problems, but not force... not force. Do bombs count as force?
Dalai Lama must be Vulcan.
There is nothing groundbreaking about this quote. It lines up very well with Buddhist ideals. That being said, he really has no idea about prayer since it is an alien concept to him. I believe that only God can deliver us from ourselves, that we are not able to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, so to speak. Christ demonstrated very clearly that human nature leads to this kind of self and societal destruction, only He was able to effect lasting change. Paul, arguably the greatest Christian who ever lived, was a Pharisee and was a mass murderer of Christians. Once Christ delivered him, he willingly laid down his life for his faith.
Stage one in becoming an atheist... 
Does this include the Buddhist extremist slaughtering innocents?
And quotes like these are the reason I hate religion. "God" seems to take all the credit and can never actually help you when you need it. The other one that really bother me is when someone does something really impressive and people are like thank you god for giving me the ability to do this. It's like god didn't do that??? You did???
You know things are bad when the Dalai Lama says Buddha can't solve this.
"....And How many battalions does the Sun God command?"


Yes,fight for peace
Based Dalai Lama
This needs to be on the front page for the next year. Finally, someone with some sense
I think the summary of this is do not look to the world with a 'gang mentality' frame.  Really understanding this gang mentality in association with confirmation bias can clear the minds of many and allow them to see from a different point of view.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOvPBfMzKjE  This puts it well.


the thing is, humans have always created most of our problems
Wow! So much more respect for this man after reading this. Fantastically said.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blKIgR-ahWA
but the government is a collection of people...
It's great how there are religious figureheads who seem to be aware that their religion is quite literally bullshit and offers nothing but empty reassurance and perhaps motivation for doing good. Many of their comments are crafted in such a way that doesn't anger the sheeps but ushers them to doing the logical thing.
I think how we deal with isis will define who we are moving forward...are we going to turn into savages like them or will we hold on to our values...it's a test of our time...
Hey look, a religious leader that believes in rationality. That's kind of strange.
So glad Im not the only one thinking changing your profile picture isn't enough. 
"For the least suffering of all," his holiness the DL.   China:  illegal occupation.   Similarly, U.S./Hawaiian Islands:  illegal occupation.   Interestingly enough, the Spirit of both cultures has not been broken by either of these governments.   
Well, no shit.
Humans created this problem by making up god, so don't pray to god about it.

I like how he thinks. 
St Augustine -Work as though everything depended on you, and pray as though everything depended on God.
I don't think violence against the perceived enemy will work. For one, I think that the violence we retaliate with brews more terrorist that will certainly strike in the future. For another, I don't believe we can pinpoint the perpetrators of these acts. We can deduct and conclude, but I don't feel we will ever know for sure. This is even with the Big Brother Society we live in. I feel that the only way to combat the extremist is through personal responsibility and accountability that must be enforced. I know this sounds ludicrous, but imagine a group of people that have never met and still they can collaborate and act swiftly to eliminate a threat. This is even negating the fact that some of them would be legal firearm carriers.  There are standards for pipes, fuels, transportation, automobiles, and every thing else on the planet. What if there was a standard for eliminating a threat? Also, what if it had a plan B,C,D,E,F,ect... I know the world is very sensitive on gun laws and that stuff but seriously, with adequate background checks and security measures why not allow an upstanding citizen to carry legally? The arguments against seem not to address the fact that there is severe prerequisites to get through including a little "Background Check".
Why no governments tho...? 
Not so wise at all
Wow didn't see that coming...
Bullshit. 
UG Blasting Dalai Lama and J Krishnamurti
https://youtu.be/_mghynk4OIg
The Dalai is just a glorified old man.  
I love this man!!
There is a Muslim parable about this. A guy goes to the mosque and leaves his donkey at the entrance. There he asks a cleric: should I tether my donkey here? Or should I just pray for it to stay around and rely on my faith? And the cleric replies: Tether your donkey, and then pray.
terrorism is not supported by the humans they are like animal who supports them and funding them. 
Well the chinese better start working with the Dalai Llama now, cos he basicly cited from (the original version of) the internationale:

&gt; There are no supreme saviours
&gt; 
&gt; Neither God, nor Caesar, nor tribune.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale

True indeed
without god, buddha, or the government, where does that leave us?
Prayers must always be accompanied by working out what we are praying for. Blessings will not fall in front of you if you will just rely on prayers.
Then what good is God or Buddha?
Note I am using it in a country.
http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2015/11/17/dalai-lama-dont-expect-help-from-god-or-govt/
I'm an atheist...but kinda like Buddhists, at least the ones I met in Thailand. Super chill dudes and I had some very interesting conversations. 

Dalai Lama's "The Art of Happiness" is a great read! 
They sentenced Ashraf Fayadh to death for not being Muslim enough. That sounds just like ISIS. They have no right to complain when people point this out. 
The fact that they are so sensitive about their justice system proves it's not a very robust system
How ISIS of them...
For anyone interested,  the domain www.saudiarabiaisisis.com is available. I might purchase the domain, but wouldn't know where to start. Seems like a fun project.


EDIT: It appears the reddit hug of death brought down the page as of 2:59 EST. I saw it when I posted this comment originally,  and I think some good SEO and some sort of social media plugs into the page would be amazing. It's a long shot, but if the page could be brought up into first page results with just the keywords of 'Saudi Arabia', I would love to see the outcome!
Fine, I won't compare them. Instead, I will contrast them. Here is a list of the differences between Saudi Arabia's justice system and Daesh: 

* None
Hereby I declare that Saudi Arabia's Justic System is basically the same as Isis. So sue me.
saudi arabia is like some sort of .... *islamic state*.
Can we please make this viral so Saudi Arabia gets more angry? 
They are the same. There. Do your worst.
1. Both employ slave labor
2. Both execute homosexuals and those who don't fit their perception of an ideal Muslim
3. Both have shamelessly destroyed priceless historic artifacts to fund themselves
4. Both oppress women
5. Both proudly fund and support terrorism
6. Both abhor democracy
7. Both are arrogant enough to claim they know gods will.
8. Both brutally suppress and stomp out dissent
9. Both spend their prodigious oil wealth on pointless stupid wars instead of providing for their citizens. 
10. Both have destroyed utterly the prestige, dignity and intellectual rigor of a fourteen hundred year old civilization out of their own stupidity. 

What the fuck is the difference honestly? 
I believe Saudi Arabia is funding Isis, promotes Isis beliefs, and has a legal and political system identical to Isis. I believe Saudi Arabia and ISIS are identical in many ways other than those, culturally as well. I think Isis, I think Saudi Arabia, the two go hand and hand. 
Well, until they stop decapitating for apostasy I shall see them as the same backwards savages as ISIS.

Now please excuse me, I have to create a twitter account and exercise my freedom of speech.
Saudi Arabia justice system is like ISIS.

I wonder if The Hague international court will accept Saudis request to extradite me and have me beheaded.

Shall be fun :)

Edit: typo
Sounds like something ISIS would say.
Saudi Arabia's Justice System **IS EXACTLY** the same as ISIS. 

I mean really how delusional do you have to be to not see that?
Saudi Arabia is just like ISIS, but with more money.
&gt;justice system

Haha
How would they go after you if you said this on reddit for instance? You're just a user name and maybe an IP. 
Saudi Arabia is Daesh.
Dear Saudi Arabia,

Your justice system is just like ISIS.

P.S. Now f**k off.
To be fair, ISIS would never sue someone.
Saudia Arabia = ISIS

come at me bro!
it'd be sweet if Anonymous would hack Saudi Arabia's twitter and change the bio to say "we are basically ISIS"
Saudi Arabia should sue ISIS for copyright violations, that's how similar their justice systems are.
[YOU ARE SO SUUUUUUED](http://southpark.cc.com/clips/155134/go-ahead-sue-me)

Edit: Your justice system is literally ISIS, Saudi Arabia. COME SUE ME.
Well they are about to have a mass execution so that sounds like something ISIS would do. 
Saudi Arabia's Justice System is just the same as ISIS.  They are all DAESH.

Bring it on you filthy dogs.
I cannot for the life of me think of a country that is more full of shit then Saudi Arabia. How are they able to breathe with their heads so deep in their asses?

YOU'RE NOT THE SAME AS ISIS, YOU'RE FUCKING WORSE. SUE ME YOU CUNTS. 
Dear Saudi-Arabia,

       Your justice system is exactly like Isis.

Sincerely,
             Everyone
It is unfair to compare Saudi Arabia's justice system to ISIS because there are obvious differences as [this](http://s18.postimg.org/tiybv93rd/Punishments_FINAL_01_1_e1421928758359.jpg) infographic shows.
Saudí arabia judges like eating beacon from their male lovers back

And their justice System is the same as ISIS

Edit: bacon
Saudi Arabia is ISIS

I think ISIS are all together better people than the Saudi leadership. 
Saudi Arabia = ISIS, FUCK WITH ME
Saudi Arabia forgets rest of the world has free speech
I think it's actually worse than ISIS because Saudi Arabia wants us to believe that they are a civilized, modern government. ISIS doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is.
Your justice system is like isis' Also you have supported terrorist regimes worldwide and even funded the flight school of a couple of the 911 hijackers.
How would they get it to stick when its pretty clear that the Justice System is similar. Doesn't seem like a hard sell in a court of law to argue their similarities? 
Saudi Arabia == ISIS with legal oil.
Since I upvoted every comment that compares them to ISIS does that mean I can get sued also?
Saudi Arabia's Justice system is just like ISIS
Where do they think ISIS got their ideas from?
Saudi Arabia as a whole is Isis not just their justice system. Sue me!!
Maybe Saudi Arabia should think about this a bit. I mean, if this critique is met with a response like that instead of a counter-argument, doesn't it sound like the critique is probably right? 

That being said, Saudi Arabia's justice system is literally ISIS. 

Come at me, bro. 
Saudi Arabia's justice system is just like that of the Daesh movement also known as ISIS.

I say this as an atheist blogger who thinks Saudi Arabia is one of the most evil countries in the world.

House of Saud is a family of greedy pig fuckers. 
Just wanted to be on record saying Saudi Arabia's justice system is exactly like ISIS.
Saudi arabia's justice system is so similar to ISIS', its almost like they have the same hardcore religious beliefs or something.
ISIS's justice system is just like Saudi Arabia's. They had to learn from someone. 
Saudi Arabia's justice system is very similar if not exactly like the Islamic States.
So, the Barbara StrISIS effect?
I hereby declare Saudi Arabia must now be called ISIS Senior. 
Saudi Arabia's justice system is the same as ISIS and they're despicable daeshbags. 
Seems like an ISIS thing to say.
No, yeah Saudia Arabia basically is ISIS. The only difference is, Saudia Arabia has been smart enough not to piss the whole world off.

I work at a law firm with 48 attorneys. Bring it on.
Jew Here. Fuck you guys. Saudi Arabia's Justice System isnt comparable to ISIS's. IT IS ISIS's. They use the exact same justice system. ISIS and Saudi Arabia are both evil creations and should be destroyed. What are you guys gonna to do a jew? Crucify me?                                                                                                                                     
Saudi Arabia justice system=ISIS
ISIS is well known to have modeled their justice system after that of Saudi Arabia.
Hereby I declare that Saudi Arabia's Justic System is basically the same as Isis. So sue me.
You don't have to compare two things if you would have a hard time telling them [apart](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/crime-and-punishment-islamic-state-vs-saudi-arabia-1588245666) .
Islamic State of Saudi Arabia 
Saudi Arabia is comparable to ISIS.
Their justice system is worse than ISIS
Saudi Arabia's justice system is similar to ISIS's 
Saudi Arabia IS Daesh. Who you gonna sue now? The entirety of the internet?
ITT : Brave soldiers of le reddit armie
 Fuck the Saudis. 
What I really know about SA is that, You can't do that, You can't do this and even You can't do this, that. 

I never heard that in SA you can visit this place, this people is really interesting, culture is amazing, nothing nothing. 

What I know about SA is, You're sentenced to death for making comment in Reddit! WTF ...

There people still living in caves.
And also similar to some parts of the US cos of all the suing?
Hereby I declare that Saudi Arabia's Justice System is basically the same as Isis
Saudi Arabia is Daesh, literally identical to Isis. Sue me bitches. 
The only difference I can think of is that somehow one of them got their hands on a seat in the UN.... 
The fact that they are much worse.
Dear Saudi Arabia,

You justice system is comparable to some of the actions committed by ISIS.



From,

Me
Fuck Saudi Arabia and there ISIS like Justice System. Stupid fucking cunts. Saudi Arabia is essentially ISIS.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is just like ISIS
Saudi Arabia's justice system is exactly like that of ISIS. Oh and get fucked you great big homophobic, sexist cunts!
The archaic government practices of Saudi Arabia are absolutely similar to the archaic and immoral practices of Isis.  Fuck off Saudi Arabia, suck deez nuts in court. 
Public twitter? Nah, I ain't setting myself up for that shit. Eat pigs, Saudi Arabia. Eat it with your psycho Daesh pigs! I know what you're doing to Europe. I know you're running out of oil. It's all an elaborate plan. But here: EAT. SOME. PIGS. PIGS!

Oh right, your justice system is just like those Daesh Pigs.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is comparable to the barbarity of ISIS.
I do hereby swear that the justice "system" in Saudi Arabia is in fact WORSE than ISIS.
You know, Saudi Arabia's justice system is comparable to ISIS.
Dear Saudi Arabia. It is the same. Sue me.
Saudi Arabia = ISIS
Saudi Arabia's justice system is comparable to ISIS since they both have no justice in their system.  
They won't even see this but fuck it. Saudi Arabia your justice system is comparable to ISIS. There
Isn't that something ISIS would do?
Doesn't persecuting people because they question your beliefs make you exactly like ISIS?

Hey Saudi's, your justice system is exactly like fucking ISIS.
Saudia Arabia's justice is WORSE than Isis.

My lawyer is laughing as he waits.

Saudi Arabias justice system is just like isis. Come at me bro
I hereby liken all of Saudi Arabia to the state Daesh wishes to create. Repressive theocracies--nuff said.
Let me go ahead and kick things off by stating LOUDLY and clearly: 

I think that Saudi Arabia's execution of the poet Ashraf Fayadh is HIGHLY reminiscent, if not IDENTICAL to the psychotic mentality that drives the terrorist group known as ISIS. 

I have NOTHING but contempt and utter disdain for the Saudi Government and the Saudi Royal family for this act.

If the Saudi Government and royal family is offended by this comment, my response is simply to raise my middle finger to your face (and also throw my shoes at you, since that also seems offensive in your culture). 

────────

Just in case I was not clear enough: Saudi Government and Saudi Royal family: you TOTALLY SUCK, and are the SAME as ISIS when you commit acts like this, such as executing poets like Ashraf Fayadh. 

If you would like to file a formal law suit against me, I WELCOME it. Just PM and I'll give you my contact information. I also fully authorize the admins at Reddit to release my IP address to the Saudi Government upon request. 

I fully welcome the challenge of a law suit, and the further media attention I will make sure it brings to your insanity and psychotic ways, and can't wait to see you in court. 


Well I for one look forward to meeting all the people in this thread in person. Do you think they'll sue us as "reddit" or as individual users?
so does saudi arabia have a twitter account we can tweet their isis resemblance to ?  
Saudi Arabia's justice system is literally ISIS.
Saudi Arabia is just like ISIS
In the words of top comment, I too say the following:

I hereby declare that Saudi Arabia's justice system is basically the same as ISIS'. Come, sue me.

**Edit:**  
Lol, this quote from the article: *"Questioning the fairness of the courts is to question the justice of the Kingdom and its judicial system based on Islamic law, which guarantees rights and ensures human dignity."*

'Cause yes, definitely, beheading innocent people for things like not being religious is absolutely in the name of justice and rights; it certainly preserves their dignity...
I hereby declare that Saudi Arabia's justice system is basically the same as ISIS. 
I have never been more tempted in my life to get a Twitter account. 
Saudi Arabia is legitimately beheading people. Their judicial system belongs in the middle ages. There's nothing civilized about it. Their inability to take criticism is very reminiscent of ISIS.
I declare Saudi Arabia's justice system fundamentally similar to that of Daesh and they can suck my pink dick
Call a spade a damn spade it's Islamic Sharia Law they have in common.
God damn, these comments are worst than those facebook "I hereby declare Facebook can't use my info" posts
Not only is their justice system as barbaric as the things ISIS is doing, it seems fairly likely that they themselves are financing ISIS. As far as I'm concerned, there is little difference between the Saudi government and ISIS
Any "justice system" that puts someone to death for any reason based on any religion is unjust. If that's Islamic law, then Islam is evil. Saudi Arabia is just like ISIS.
ISSA = Islamic State Saudi Arabia
Saudi Arabia's justice system correlates greatly to that of ISIS. 

Or is ISIS too much like Suadi?
Saudi Arabia's justice system is akin to Isis. Come at me.
Aaaaaaand go internet.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is very similar to Isis. 
*compares Saudi Arabia's justice system to isis*
Saudi Arabia's justice system is comparable to ISIS. SUE ME
Don't hate, castrate!
Dear Saudi Arabia -
Your justice system is comparable to ISIS. 
-come at me bro
The irony is that these assholes are considered USA allies while Iran which is probably most progressive middle eastern country is evil one. I guess money talks..
Amputation is amputation by any other name.

The difference between Saudi Arabia's leaders and these Daesh is one is best friends with the Bushes and the other isn't.
Saudi Arabia's criminal justice system is comparable to ISIS.
Isis has people. Saudi Arabia's Judicial System has people. Saudi Arabia's judicial system is therefore undeniably comparable to Isis, and so is, at least to some to some degree, "Isis-like."

Also, both the terrorist group and the nation are brutal, radical, intolerant, and should be destroyed and/or disbanded. 
______________
To whoever sentenced that journalist to death for making an obviously legitimate and accurate comparison: 

&gt;I hope you die covered in pig's blood, since I hear you think that would mean you can only go to hell. You deserve to know perfect and absolute terror for killing an innocent.

____________


Also, Saudi Arabia? [Here's a picture of Mohammad and Allah](http://imgur.com/tS0Gxpw), drawn by yours truly. Also, Mohammad and Allah love bacon and pork and love gay sex. 

In short, Saudi Arabia, fuck you, fuck off, and *never* make obviously empty threats.
Saudi Arabia is ISIS
Saudi Arabia = ISIS
At least ISIS doesn't play a huge role on the world stage, so, in many ways, Saudi Arabia is even worse than ISIS.
*Ahem*

Saudi Arabia's justice system would be more suited to the "justice" distributed by ISIS.

Lawyer up, atheist killing, women beating, apostate murdering barbarian fucktards.
**SAUDI ARABIA CAN SUCK MAH DICK!** And since ISIS is one of the same..**they can get it too**..Just sayin'
Saudi Arabia has a justice system like that of ISIS.

you know where to find me.
Saudi Arabia = Isis
sodomi shitabia
What court would I be tried in... Hopefully not saudia arabias. I heard they are like ISIS over there 
Hey Saudi Arabia, your justice system is just like ISIS.
Hereby I declare that Saudi Arabia's Justic System is basically the same as Isis. So sue me.
Their justice system is just like isis
this shit began in Saudi Arabia

Saudi Arabia's justice system *is* like that of ISIS
Dear Saudi Arabia,

Your justice system is just like ISIS'. If you would like to sue me, feel free to PM me so I can send you my contact details if necessary.

Go fuck yourselves,

/u/brecka
ISIS = Executed in video
SA = Flogged in public, then excuted
hmm.. all of a sudden I feel the need to say that their justice system resembles that of ISIS.
Hereby I declare that Saudi Arabia's Justic System is basically the same as Isis. So sue me. FUCK SAUDI ARABIA. COME GET ME. PLEASE.
I guess we all thought the same damn thing.

If you kill people for leaving your state religion, that's pretty much the same thing Daesh is doing.
I compare their justice system to ISIS
Hey i think they are exactly the same as isis, come sue me bitches!!!!!
Hey Saudi Arabia - your king is a dick and your "justice system" is a joke and worse than Daesh. At least they don't pretend to be fair.
Come on. Saudi Arabia's justice system is not the same as ISIS. Give ISIS's justice system's older brother a little credit. He was around first... he's got a cool car, and lives in a nice house. ISIS? That dude still rides the bus and steals oil from his mom's rig.
At least ISIS doesn't sue people who disagree with them before executing them. Unlike Saudi Arabia.
I hereby declare Saudi Arabia is just like ISIS. Fuck you S.A.
Saudi arabia is a sand hole and their justice system is worse than isis because theyre an actual country and should be held to higher standards.

I work at walmart. Good luck getting money from me with $10 in my bank account.
Saudi Arabia is literally ISIS. Come at me bro
Saudi Arabia justice system is extremely similar to ISIS 
Ugh, I'm really pissed that now I have to make a public twitter account just to say Saudis Arabia and their justice system are the exact same as ISIS. 
YOU FUCKING JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THE SAME THAT ISIS! SUE ME YOU DISGUSTING KING-wannabe.
I want to make a twitter account just to say this.

They can't do shit to me.
When they say stuff like this, they really do come across like ISIS. If I did compare their justice system to that of ISIS' (which it is exactly the same), would my government support me or SA?
Would they need to do this if it wasn't?
aren't they the same though?
Saudi Arabia, your justice system is comparable to Isis.

*hides in a closet*
Fuck Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia = Isis
"Saudi Arabia's justice system is exactly like ISIS."

Come at me, bro.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is comparable to ISIS. Come at me bro.
Saudi Arabia and ISIS should just fuck and get it over with already. I mean, they agree on EVERYTHING, except loving each other. It might relieve some stress, who knows
if(ISIS == Saudi Arabia){
   
   Saudi Arabia--;

}
The Saudi Arabian justice system is just like isis...boom sue me motherfuckers.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is like the justice system used by ISIS.

Time to hit my lawyer, Jim.
Saudi Arabia justice system is similar to ISIS :P 

There's a difference between Saudi Arabia and ISIS?
By "sue", they mean, "fly planes into".
Suadia Arabia = Isis 

Sue me.
What if we contrast their justice system with Isis?
Saudi Arabia's justice system is like ISIS.  Sue me cunts 
Have you seen the Justice System of ISIS? Reminds me a lot of the justice system of those barbarians in Saudi Arabia.
The Saudi Arabian justice system is similar, if not identical to Daesh's.

Bring the lawsuits. My body is ready.
Fuck Saudi Arabia. Their justice system is comparable to ISIS'. 

^#SaudiArabiaIsDaesh
Saudi Arabia, your government is essentially ISIS, go on - sue me. My name is Cyril Figgis!
What's wrong, Saudi Arabia? Don't like that good look in the mirror at some of your own human rights violations?
True, their system is not like ISIS, it's worse..
Sounds like Isis has a similar justice system to Saudi Arabia.
Promises, promises. I think Saudi Arabia's justice system is exactly like ISIS. Bring it bitch!
The saudi justice system is a fucking joke and exactly like ISiS. Fucking sue me. *middle finger*
Saudia Arabia is basically ISIS with more money and international trade. No one should do business with them, they are barbarians. 
The Saudi Arabian "justice" system is reminiscent of the system through which ISIS dispenses "justice". 

Sue my dick off
The Saudi Arabian justice system is similar to ISIS

EDIT: Except that they are one of our biggest allies.  Disgusting
Saudi Arabia = ISIS.

Not just their backwards ass justice system... the whole system. The entire country might as well be ISIS because they are living in the same Middle-Age era that ISIS are. 

Saudi Arabia - I hate you. The world hates you.

Sue me.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is the premier version of ISIS. 

All western countries have a moral obligation to step in and do something. This is a violation of human rights.
BRB, looking up all official Saudi Arabian twitter accounts.

Also, here's just as good: I declare that Saudi Arabia's justice system is as bad as that of ISIS.
Saudi Arabia is no better than the terrorists. Sue me bitches, I'll go American on your asses.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is the same as that of ISIS. 
Saudi Arabia's justice system is comparable to ISIS.

I'll just wait over here
Not just their justice system, the whole country is set up like ISIS but it has the gold standard of legitimacy that is buying western arms.
Saudi Arabia's justice system is very comparabale to that of the IS caliphate. Come at me bruh
&gt;"Questioning the fairness of the courts is to question the justice of the Kingdom and its judicial system based on Islamic law, which guarantees rights and ensures human dignity"

Like the dignity of murdering someone for apostasy? Yeah I'd say that's pretty questionable.
Fuck the saudis.  Their justice system is *worse* than ISIL's, not better.  They're more corrupt, more evil, and more bigoted than the worst terror groups out there.  I don't give a fuck if a lawyer comes to my door, they can't pretend their system of systematic beheadings is any more evolved than a bunch of monkeys screaming at each other.
Saudi Arabia justice system is another name for ISIS
So basically Saudi Arabia is now ISIS?
saudi arabia should be next on the bombing list after syria.

beheading people for no reason and they get appointed to head a HUMAN RIGHTS panel at the UN, fucking hilarious.
Sue me you ISIS like peice of crap "justice" system.
If you read the article, it's actually much worse than it appears. 
Sounds like something ISIS would do. 
Edit: Hi everyone! I'm not replying to any of you, because I can't be bothered! Thanks for the replies and stuff though, happy to have helped the discussion. 
So a poet is being sentenced to death just for not wanting to partake in religion. This is ridiculous. Saudi Arabian government is a fucking joke.
This must be OK because they're on the UN council of human rights, right?
Saudi Arabia ally and friend of the west. Fucking scandalous this is allowed in this day and age. Disgusting. Medieval idiocy. 


But at least they take many Syrian refugees... oh wait.
[In other news, US sells $1.29bn worth of arms to Saudi Arabia](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/16/us-saudi-usa-arms-idUSKCN0T51NC20151116)
But that's okay, because they have oil. And we like oil. Right??

Not only that, but we like selling arms to them, too. (Why Canada?)

As long as they're buying and selling, governments will turn a blind eye to this and every other barbaric action that they have and will commit. 

It's 2015 Saudi Arabia....get out of the fucking stone age.
Saudi Arabia - Come for the death! Stay for the death!
I gotta ask, Is there any redeeming quality to that country?
Easily the most hated, despicable nation in the world. 
He has no choice but to lie about his beliefs in order to stay alive. Makes you wonder how many people in the world are secretly Atheists/Agnostics but lie about it out of fear of their own community.
Let's be real. Saudi Arabia is what ISIS would look like if it controlled a country and decided to stop expanding. 
The evil are intimidated by the intelligent.

This man appears to know more than his government.
Member of the UN council on human rights, everyone.
This is EXACTLY why alternate energy is so important. Once we finally get out of bed with these oil nations, then hopefully we can pressure their leaders to wake up join the fucking 21st Century. 
Laws should be based on morality and ethics, not religion.
I despise the utter hypocrisy and decadence of the Saudi royal family, but the sad fact is that the current regime is far, far better than what will inevitably replace it if we topple the Royals. 

Imagine an Islamic Republic of Arabia, with a population of 32 million extremist Wahhabis, no longer hiding it's direct assistance to the IS and other terror groups, able to blackmail the world's muslim population into obedience through control of access to Mecca, and with a huge chunk of the world's proven oil reserves.

Islamic Arabia would make Saudi Arabia look like Amsterdam during gay pride.
The type of friends we keep emphasize the hypocrisy of our foreign policy. 
Q: How many Saudi Arabian court members does it take to change a light bulb?                                                      
A: None, because they want to keep us in the dark ages.
21st century calling Saudi Arabia...hello?....hello? 
The fastest the world can ditch oil the better.
I'm glad these guys are on the United Nations’ Human Rights Council. 
We just agreed to sell them $1.9 billion in arms. As an atheist myself, and frankly  as just a fucking human being, I'm disgusted.
Roses are red

Religion untrue

I'll soon be dead

Next will be you
No different from ISIS' ideology. 
Death for apostasy is a widely held majority belief in dozens of Islamic countries.  This is not just a Saudi problem...
How is this okay?
How is anyone okay with this?

Sentenced to death for a lack of faith is an insanely scary thought. I wish I could rescue this person from such a situation.
The financiers of ISIS at their finest. Bravo America for not standing up to this complete and utter trash dump of a country. 
I really hate how we consider these people our allies. 
A lot of people are blaming Saudi Royals, and that is misguided. The issue is with the Sharia Law that was enacted by the religious establishment in Saudi Arabia, and they are supported financially by the monarchy in an attempt to increase the monarchy's legitimacy.

It's very similar to what happened on season 5 of Game of Thrones with Cersei Lannister and the Faith Militant.
Islamic states are Islamic. They are just doing what they are supposed to be doing. Why is it shocking at all?
read this today and thought it was spot on about Saudi Arabia... http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/opinion/saudi-arabia-an-isis-that-has-made-it.html
They haven't even reached the point where Europe was at the time of the 18th century materialists.
Is this the goddam Middle Ages?
And I'm supposed to respect Islam why?
[CJ had it right years ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHGN-1Os31U)
The war on ISIS begins and ends with wiping KSA off the map.
This really highlights we should care more about culture than religion. Many people are muslims, but the middle east has it's own special brand of culture which is how to put nicely.... medieval.
And the West supports this fucked up regime, why?... Oh, yeah, that oil thing.     

Man, I can't wait until they run out of it so we can go forward with ignoring these backward fucks.
A Nation that is literally Trailer Trash

This bad joke of a country can't be bombed into glass soon enough for me.  

edit: I'm being a dick.  They don't need to be bombed.  We just need to stop supporting them for 5 minutes so they can reap what they've sewn.  
What do we expect?

On a side note isn't it great that the US just approved a major arms sale to the Saudis?  These people are not our allies.  They laugh at our greed as they take the money we give them for oil and use it to fund attacks against us.  The US should ban all sale of weapons to any Islamic nation and seek political agreements with Russia and others to do the same.
This is just absolutely unacceptable in 2015.  Fuck these assholes.  And fuck your bullshit religion that causes you to do this nonsense.  
USA supports all this because it supports and sells arms to saudi arabia.
That's ok, they can do it, they are a major ally to the US in the Middle East, but if Assad would have done this, then there would be an outcry like you haven't seen before. 
What a brilliant merican ally!
Once again these brave men defended the all powerful allah from the bad bad bad poet... after all, you need religion to be moral right?

Friends with the Saudis who have no idea what human rights are. Friends with Israel who are gently wiping out the Palestinians from existence. Are you sure we are the good guys?
But Islam's not the issue, guys!
/s
Man this is a fucking joke. How bout the politicians denounce this shit instead of denouncing people who are running for their lives? Oh this guy I helping turn the tide about how the world views our country and bringing our art to the rest of the world? Better find a reason to kill him.
It's one thing to die for something you believe in. It's sheer lunacy that people are dying for what they don't believe in. 
I think it's pretty clear Saudi Arabia and ISIS come hand in hand. Maybe one day the world will see it for what it really is. A terrorist state.
I'm shocked!  Our good friends the Saudis?  But how could they?  I mean, wow.  Only 15 of the 19 terrorists who struck us on 9/11 in America were Saudis.  I'd never expect this kind of behavior from them.  

Oh wait, I expect this from them every fucking day.  Why the FUCK is America allied with this piece of shit nation?
One more example why the West shouldn't be so cozy with this backwards nation.
After reading this it occurred to me that these people *lead the discussions regarding human rights at the UN*. 

(212-963-7533) That is the UN's lost and found number. I've called asking them if they can help me find my sanity since I must have lost my mind. We live in a world where this is perfectly acceptable? Saudi Arabia gets to sit as fucking leader of human rights discussions?

What a joke. Dissolve the UN. Decimate the Royal Family in Saudi Arabia.
The older I get, the more disturbed about this world I become. We're in trouble. This is unacceptable. Historical barbarism was always troubling. It made you wonder how people could have done such things to other people. But it's just as bad now as it's ever been, if not worse. There are too many folks on this planet whose minds are warped by radical religious viewpoints. They talk about Allah being great, God being great ... whatever ... and they are somehow made to believe that killing other people is something that this great God wants. We humans need to find out a way to bring a halt to this ongoing religious brainwashing. If we don't, one of these days some of these nuts are going to get their hands on some nuclear bombs, and then this whole thing might come toppling down.
Martyred for atheism
It's not Saudi Arabia that'she the culprit here -- it's Islam, a religion founded so one asshole named Muhammad could convince other people to kill his enemies while he stayed home and fucked child brides.  The best argument against Islam is the Quran, which condones everything awful, violent, racist, sexist, and just plain idiotic that intelligent and progressive people should despise.  If you haven't read it, you should do so before you ever use the word "Islamaphobia" again.
It's stories like this that make me wish we can get off oil now...just so we can take away the power of these savages.  The middle east would be worst off than Africa if it couldn't sell oil. 
So why isn't this thread filled with muslims denouncing this as not being "true Islam"?
guys chill, there is very peaceful religious stuff going on here you wouldn't understand.
Religion - Making idiots out of people since its inception.
Every time I hear anything about the Saudis, it's always terrible.  Why do we even deal with these people?  I'd rather pay another dollar per gallon of gas than have to work with these shitcakes.
Didn't Muhammad himself order the murders of poets for not speaking fondly of him?
We don't need those horrible fucks in the world. Burn that false religion to the ground.
I believe this is the definition of a "witch hunt", the man is not an Atheist by his and friends accounts. "Morality Police" have essentially made up charges in an effort to get revenge on him from posting a video of religious lashing.
Our "ally" ladies and gentlemen! 
it is amazing how US is so close with Saudi Arabia... yeah the leader of Iran is extreme, but the the Iranian people have 100x more in common with us than do Saudi Arabians

And people actually believe that the Islam of Saudi Arabia is different than the Islam Daesh practices.
And the US just sold this barbaric nation $1.3billion worth of weaponry, GG.
I'm confused. So you're saying that a country filled with barbarians occasionally engages is barbaric, backward, unthinkable actions against its citizens?  Soo surprising. 
If the US cared about any modicum of human rights, we'd threatened to cancel all arms trade with Pariah Arabia.

I suspect we won't.
Muslim countries in a nutshell
Everyone calm down, we just sold them 1.5 billion in weapons! Everything will be fine!
Man this is fucked

&gt;The case highlights the tensions between hardline religious conservatives and the small but growing number of artists and activists who are tentatively pushing the boundaries of freedom of speech in Saudi Arabia, where **cinema is banned** and there are **no art schools**
Saudi Arabia are just fancy versions of Isis. The faster the oil dries up the better
But people people we must accept muslims for their "cultural differences". And don't for a minute give me the this is not *real* Islam garbage. This is the very geographic and spiritual home of Islam. It's in the direction of where this sentence was passed that every muslim turns to to pray. This is at the very core of what it means to be a Muslim.

Pssh fairweather liberals. The poet is the true hero and Islam is the problem. Bring on ye downvotes, I feast on your tumblr-tears.
The US needs to stop supporting Saudi Arabia.  
They are murdering him for showing their religious police abusing a person. But they are terming this as executing apostate to appeal to ultra religious right. What it's going to do is give legitimacy to the false notion that in Islam apostates are to be executed. That gives legitimacy to ISIS and when it slaughters non Muslims. This is a clusterfuck of a thing. Saudi should free this man and let him believe or not believe whatever he wants. If Islam is truely the chosen faith by Allah, it needn't be forced on people. People will automatically and eventually gravitate toward Islam.
Can we just call both ISIS and SA Daesh for clarity?
Imagine if Saudi Arabia didn't have oil, or refused to sell it in US dollars.
If there's one thing conservatives and liberals can all agree on, it's that the house of Saud needs to go the way of the dodo.
Saudi Arabia strikes again. The royal kingdom of cunts responsible for destabilizing the middle east strikes again. I won't be surprised if much of isis is from that  backwards place. Good thing is its just the ruling class of elites that runs that countey you could put the all in boat and sink that fucker to sea floor. Change the world  
pretty disgusting how we're bombing isis and meanwhile our supposed 'ally' is pulling this sh*t every day. boycott saudi arabia 2015
evolution didn't take for the Saudis.
WAR ON ATHEISM!
Countries that base their legal system on fictitious books written about non-existent magical beings should be dis-allowed from being members of the United Nations.  We should never form any kind of Alliance with them and no legal decision made by their courts should ever be granted any weight.  Yes I am an atheist because I base my belief system on the "Real" world and Scientific discovery.  Man invented Deity out of ignorance not stupidity.  It is time for Humans to realize we do not need a crutch anymore we can stand on our own and walk in the sun because we Exist and we no longer need to cower behind religion to be happy.  Fuck all Religions they are a waste of your intelligence and if you weren't a bunch of sheep your lives would be better.         
Yet they claim islam is a peaceful religion. More like they're all violent mindless animals, getting mad somebody insulted their fictional pedophile illiterate god.
Let's be honest - coming out publicly as an atheist in **America** doesn't always go well. What could we possibly expect from a backwards, terrorist supporting region like Saudi Arabia?
We are the ones who propped up the Saudi Royal Family for oil access.  Us. murika. .  We create these devils and yet we refuse to hold anyone accountable for our foreign polocy disasters like every event that has happened in the middle east since world war one.  Its hopeless, and its too late to fix.  We're going down, people.  Even Ike would tell us to bail.  FDR would have surrendered ten years ago.  After W and Cheney's treason FDR would have felt we had no choice.  Its like as if benedict arnold had succeeded, we would have lost our revolutionary war.  The fort at west point was too strategic to lose.  
That is how bad W f'd up, people, wth his catastrophic invasion of iraq.  So we are the great satan, the enemy within and without, and we did it to ourselves. For oil, and to enrich the already rich.  
When are we going to accept that Islam is the problem? 
The poet should have farted in the judge's face - he probably would have had the sentence commuted. 
3rd time ive seen this news, but now that they pu atheism in the title it goes straight to the top. Seemsgood. 
Gotta love those Arabs. They are unashamedly bastards and don't give a fuck about what is right.
If they wouldn't have oil they would have been bombed out of existence a long time ago.
The entire middle east is garbage with old ass views. This aint even a muslim thing, it's just their fucking culture sucks. This is why I am all for just bombing the shit out of the middle east. Every country there is awful.

Downvote away!
Saudi Arabia needs to be turned to glass 
Fuck Saudi Arabia and fuck anyone who supports their regime.
these guys are fuckin whacko, why the fuck is everyone bending over for an arse raping from them? NZ keeps sucking their dick over live sheep export.
That's the country we should bomb...
but my car needs petrol.....how am i supposed to feel at this moment?
Can we just, like, blacklist Saudi Arabia already? Move out all our bases and equipment and end our alliances with them. I mean, I understand why we have relations with them. It has just as much to do with keeping them out of countries as it does keeping other countries out of their own country, but they just go and fund organizations behind close doors anyway. US bases are of strategic importance in that region, especially for Israel, but at a certain point it isn't worth the trouble anymore.
Now that I don't get. Suppose any religion that promotes violence shouldn't be a religion. We're given religious rights but if a religion promotes killing of the innocents, perhaps it shouldn't be included in the list of religion were protected under. We made laws against Hitler groups and other groups, why can we make laws to prohibit violent religions? Why have buildings where people gather to learn how to kill innocent people? Why should we have a how to murder school? Beats me why we have a how to get away with murder TV show. 
Why we even communicate with these morons is beyond me.

The truth is they know they will be back living in desert in a generation or two yet act this way today is baffling.
Can you remind me the real difference between ISIL and Saudi Arabia other than the Saudi Arabia has been a kingdom for a while and that no one in the the Western world is contesting its territory ?
Our UN Human Rights council member, everyone.
I know the situation is complicated and the West's hands are tied in a lot of ways, but can we stop pretending these guys are a civilised modern nation now? Jesus.
Is it time to end our (American) alliance with this joke of a state yet? For crying out loud, the oil isn't worth it.
Can we do anything about this?
Our allies, everybody! 
Medieval country 
Funk you United States for selling a billion dollars worth of weapons to this dirt shit back whole run country.
Funk you United nations for putting these dirt shit eaters as head of Human Rights and seeing this don't do anything about it
Ahhh huh, feel much better now.
its like were still in the middle ages
&gt;He added that the book, **Instructions Within**, published in 2008, was “just about me being [a] Palestinian refugee … about cultural and philosophical issues. But the religious extremists explained it as destructive ideas against God.”

I feel the very least I could do is read his words... But try as I might, I can't find his book for sale anywhere. Does anybody know how to find it? 
Stay safe out there /u/Poem_for_your_sprog, reddit needs you 
Saudi Arabia is stupid 
Speaking of hypocrisy
Disgusting country, disgusting "royals".
Just so that there's no confusion. The poet himself is not an atheist - the court in SA are saying his work promotes the idea of atheism. 
LOL why would you think this is some new revolutionary thing? It happens regularly to gay people, apostates, and adulterers. This poet is just getting attention because he is semi-famous.
and still they can head HRC. So much for the UN charter.
It seems hypocritcial that we are at war with Islamic terrorism yet at the same time this country is considered an ally.
Don't care, need oil.

Dear Saudi Arabia, get out of the Stone Age.
These people exemplify scum of the earth. I would like nothing more than to hear that the Royal family was stripped of all of their wealth and possessions and left to fend for themselves amongst the poor population they constantly oppress.

Piece of shit scumbags deserve nothing but a slow, painful death.
ISIS and the Saudi Gov have a lot in common....
Fuck that place
Fuck Saudi Arabia. God damn it. Literally.
When was the last time the Catholic church executed people for not being catholic? like year 1200?
[deleted]
Saudi Arabia is financing Daesh, what did you expect ? They may have pretty clothes, but they are no better than the so called islamic state in Syria.
"bro, our god is soooo weak sauce, we can't even have you mention it in your book"    
AS a US citizen I'm appalled that we support this back asswards country in any way.
Or as they call it : A normal Friday.
this is why islamic countrys only offer 1% of all peered review science papers. because the been systemically removing anyone who is bright enough to oppose its ideology for the last 1500 years.  
WHAT THE FUCK? i'm a muslim myself, but I agree with all you guys: Saudi Arabia is a retarded asshole country.
We only have ourselves to blame. If it wasnt for our never ending supply of money/weapons for oil, what would they be? Whatever you may think of SA...we support them, directly or indirectly. 

Im pretty sure that if it wasnt for their oil we would have already invaded them just for human rights violations alone.
Head of the UN Human Rights Council. Yeah...
You won't hear a single peep from the US or UK about it either. Pathetic.

“I’ve known him since 2003. He’s a truly wonderful, kind person. He’s an intellectual and creative but he’s not an atheist.”

A potent acknowledgement that to be an atheist, you should be  intelligent and creative.
The worst part about this is that Saudi Arabia officials *know* that there is nothing wrong with being an atheist. They participate in the international community, and they know the world hasn't blown up because god-forbid someone isn't Muslim. Yet, knowing the way the rest of the world is, they want to execute the guy? My theory is that this is nothing more than a distraction for their society, or they really are that arrogant of a culture. Does Saudi Arabia actually believe they are the only "correct" people on earth, and that everyone else are somehow sinful pigs? to them? 
But Islam isn't an misogynist or intolerant religion! It's only somewhere between 20-80% of the billion or so Muslims who actually believe in death to apostates or less than full rights for women!
Leave it to sand people.
NYT published an op-ed piece calling Saudi Arabia an ISIS that "made it." I'm inclined to agree.
These sand eaters are the smut of our planet
How can a country this backward still exist today?
can we kick these saudi idiots off the *human rights* panel that they *lead* somehow?

what the fuck, UN?
head of the human rights right here guys. i wonder how the world would react if nazi Germany was given the position Saudi has
Let's not forget Saudi Arabia refuses to take in a single Syrian refugee, even though it's geographically and culturally more similar to Syria than Europe is. At the same time Saudi Arabia is providing funding to build 500 mosques in Germany. Why are western democracies allied with such a fucked up country?
The head of the UN human rights council, everybody.
Why the fuck is the west even remotely friendly to this hellhole? We should have no diplomatic relations with them whatsoever, furthermore a complete embargo on all trade in and out of the country.
This is pretty much exactly why no matter how much I want to be open minded about Muslims I just can't. I'm perfectly aware that it's not all of them doing it, but you might just as well ask a Jew to be open minded about Germans in 1944.
Holy fucking irony, I just shit myself and I'm not even wearing pants.
What a horse shit country. 
Probably the worst country in the world. Yeah, I know that North Korea is awful, but at least they don't have global influence.
So in other news Saudi Arabia is like Daesh, but they are in the UN council of human rights and they're accepted as a country.
It's the fucking Saudis!
Saudi Arabia is what you would call a "successful" islamic state. They are basically diet ISIS.
They're savages, but they're rich savages, so we love 'em! 

And by 'we' I mean the multi-millionaire elites representing us in Washington.
Saudi Arabia is a basically a shitty Medieval Monarchy that somehow managed to make it to 2015, that sadly has guns...and oil (because that's what determines a strong ethical backbone).
And they are US allies. 
You don't think like me, so I kill you? Makes 0 sense. They just want a blind herd.
Saudi Arabia is really fucked up, but here's the thing:

You have to sign off papers stating you have to follow all the rules of the "kindgom" or else you could be persecuted or even killed.
No words can explain how fucking awful this is. 
I can't wait till that country runs out if oil and they are back in the stone ages like iraq and Afghanistan. Fuck those people 
It's 2015 and barbaric nonsense like this is still permitted and relevant.

What age are we in? The bronze age? Jesus christ on a fucking bendy bus, Saudi arabia is a failed state at this point if they are allowing stupid idiocy like this to thrive.
Why are they our allies again?
GLAD WE'RE SELLING THE GUNS
"Human rights"
The usa supports suadi arabia as well. Our nation is feeding this sick evil government ladies and gentlemen. Without the support of the usa this crap would not be going down.  Your tax dollars paid for this evil shit. Congratulations.
Why the fuck are Saudi Arabia and Turkey allies to the west?
But wait, does that mean Islam isn't all just rainbows and happiness and ISIS make up everything they do? Are you genuinely implying there are horrific acts of violence and intolerance in the Quran?
Reddit actually not liking something a Middle Eastern country does. noooo, I thought we all waived rainbow flags and held hands here? 
This will be the U.S. in 50 years and Europe in 25. Yippie!
The magic of religion. Again.

This is not some misinterpretation or extremism at work here (or with ISIS, for that matter). 

For most (western) people, the "word of god" as represented in these ridiculous texts isn't taken literally, despite the rhetoric and bullshit they might spew and try to legislate. Why is what the Saudi's are doing so wrong? They are merely obeying the word of (their) god, not unlike the born-again lunatics in the US trying to ban gay marriage or whatever.

Having religion really is like having a dick; whoopee for you, but please just keep it to yourself and for fuck's sake never shove it down anyone's throat that isn't eagerly asking for it.
Yet somehow we keep doing billions of dollars in weapons sales to this country despite the continual violation of basic human rights.  
I was JUST reading a New York Times op-ed entitled "Saudi Arabia- A Daesh that's made it". 

And that's the consensus among my Muslim friends too. 

By the way, I recommend reading that op-ed. This war will go on for generationsunless SA makes some serious changes itself. 
Actually, this news article is very liberal with its wording, as of this moment China has not "declared war", and thoroughly searching Chinese news outlets for any mention of this came up with nothing
China wants to get involved because Uyghur separatists have supposedly joined up with ISIS.  If any of these get back to China, they'd bring along the ISIS playbook and make things a lot harder for China to stop terror attacks.  According to the Wiki, 800 people have been killed by Uyghur separatists since 2009.  
ISIS is also building a time machine to piss off Hitler, Genghis Khan and Leonidas.
Tomorrow's headline: "North Korea mobilizes to destroy ISIS."
I think the real issue is going to be staying out of each other's way. 
If you have managed to get the US, China and Russia to attack one "enemy", you really have fucked up.
We now have Russia, USA, France, and China going completely after ISIS. Enough 'superpowers' to level the entire word without using nukes. Now all we need to do is find ISIS.
I am starting to feel like the leader of ISIS may be named "Zero" or Lelouche" 
"I don't know guys, I think you can fit one more in my butt." -ISIS

edit: thank you kindly for the gold!
Woo hoo world war 3 where the whole world is on the same side... Come on multi culture pals let's blow these fuckers to smithereens.
All I can think is Civ V at this point.

"Damascus has requested help in destroying a nearby barbarian encampment."
By definition, a "world war" is a military conflict involving a majority of the world's "primary" nations. It's bizarre to imagine that in this case, World War III may be "Everybody versus ISIS".
The attack in mali's capital killed "more than people"? WHAT ELSE DIED??
ISIS is either really doing their best to start this so called apocalypse and end time battle, or their leader is just the smartest person *cough* Ozymandias *cough* and is about to usher in a new wave of global peace and unity. 


The dragon joins the eagle the bear and the lion in the war on terror
I'm wondering if they plan a land invasion with small groups of 2 million soldiers each.
I think it is worth noting that isis has been the greatest force in uniting the world powers litterly ever. Not global warming, economic melt downs, Ebola, or 9/11 united so many nations. So in a weird fucked up kinda way, they could eventually be seen as the catalyst for some future world collaboration projects
&gt;Chinese President Xi Jinping: "China will strengthen cooperation with the international community, resolutely crack down on violent terrorist operations that devastate innocent lives and safeguard world peace and security."

I hope good things come out of this. 
I was relieved bout Russia going after ISIS but hell even im clueless on what chinese are capable if get pissed off
1. Unite literally everybody against us.

2. ???

3. Prophet?
This is starting to feel like end game Civilization 5
Congratulations Daesh, you managed to unanimously unite the P5 on a single issue, wanting you dead. This is probably one of the most significant diplomatic successes of the 21st century and a real step towards world peace... over your dead bodies.

Vote Daesh for Nobel Peace Prize 2017!
I want to see Mexico declare war on ISIS because I want to see the cartel go after them.
***"Fuck"***

-ISIS 2015
The world now agrees on 2 things:

1 coca cola rocks 

2 Isis sucks 
&gt;following an attack in Mali that killed more than people, including three Chinese rail executives. 


Is Mirror implying that Chinese rail execs are more than people? 

Probably not, probably a typo 
Is this World War 3???
Isis is gonna be so done with religion and war once they realize weed and video games are a thing 
China could put so many boots on the ground that the land would sink, don't piss China off.
Conspiracy Keanu: Maybe ISIS's main goal is to unite the world, and is aware that the only conceivable way of doing so is by terrorizing all the heavyweight nations unconditionally
Dear ISIS,

Y'all done fucked up now.

Sincerely,

The World
ISIS must've missed that bit in the Koran where the armies of the eastern dynasties showed up for the party.
For fuck's sake Reddit, stop using sources like the Mirror or Daily Mail. 
I mean seriously, it's full of such shit and bollocks hyperbole.

It's shit journalism with shittier editing and even shittier credibility.

"...attack by militants on a hotel in Mali's capital that killed more than people yesterday..."

"Welcome player 'China' to the game"
The Chinese military has not been involved in any military conflict since the 80s. They sat quietly through the war on terror in the 2010s.

Let's see them wake up and do something now.
Everybody wants to get into this war.

When I was younger we used to wait for an invite!
Do any of these countries have a plan for stabilizing the region after they wipe Daesh of the face of the earth?
Too late to the party as usual...

However, we have a really fucked up situation here, regardless of Assad, Saudi, Kurds and the UN security council being involved...

ISIS are not a national army, despite their caliphate claim. They are an extremist faction of islam, with 100s, if not 1000s of cells all around the world. Like a virus waiting to strike.

The story that one guy wrote of humming the ICIS overtune at his desk which invited a middle-eastern guy at his work to say "One day our time will come brother", or the video of the anti-UK islamic march in Luton send shivers. 

The fuckers are everywhere, and there's no direct command and control structure. They don't have a papal figure who can disown a branch of the religion and hand down a purgatorial judgement on the followers of this faction. They are looser connected than Anonymous. The problem is most akin to cancer.

I think our only chance is for islam itself to root out the bad factions. I honestly don't see any other way. Their failure to do so could ultimately lead to a proper WW3 - Islam v ROW.
Any day now, the prophecy as foretold by the Daesh leader Al Assafuk Daeshbag will come true.  
"They've fallen victim to one of the classic blunders!"
Nice to know China is ready to go to war when 4 of their people are killed. 
wow Command and Conquer Generals anyone??
Why are we still calling them terrorists?  I mean at some point they have to graduate to some other enemy status since they clearly own a large territory, have a military and are currently in a war.   Several nations have declared war on them.  Do we just say it because the word "terrorist" gets votes?  Sometimes I think labeling them as terrorists will lose support for a war against them as people consider it as a pointless war against Al Qaeda hiding in the mountains.
I'd like to see if China's air force can actually carry out combat sorties in Syria.  They haven't really done anything besides marching up and down the square since the 1950's, have they?
Now that all five permanent UN Security Council members have declared war on the same target, could they, theoretically, jointly decide to nuke ISIS and veto any UN repercussions?
China will sell illegal copies of ISIS videos at low low prices 
I love the idea that ending ISIS may become the global-politics equivalent of a team building day. 
This is bad.  Very bad.   Ye of reddit are faaaarrrrr too trusting of the motivations of China and Russia.   

Remember how you suspected Cheney of everything bad?     Chinese politicians are much worse than that


I don't think anyone in here realizes what a dire world situation this Isis issue is. We have a part of the globe that has lived such a gross and disgusting way of perceiving reality while training children to be zombies and believe that they're doing is for their God.  I fear that all this reddit mongering and confidence is being short sighted and we're not seeing and actual real and present danger to us all.  We must be cognizant of the fact that we have a desperate foe who cares not about their own lives and will see us out.  The fact that we've let almost a generation of kids in the middle east grow to hate the modernized world scares the beJesus out of me and the implications of future danger their absolute brainwashed existence.  If you think that we're going to wipe them clean by bombs you're living in fucking lala land.  Problem is is I don't see a fix to this and I think our meddling in the Middle East has come to haunt us now.  Goddamn I hate dumb humans, where's my spaceship so I can get outta here....
Fuck it, now we all need to agree that we *ALL* put boots on the ground.

Just one gigantic ring of tanks and APCs and dudes with assault rifles, all advancing inwards, fuck the roads we're finding every goddamn camp and latrine these fuckheads have ever dug, with red smoke (probably have to rotate this one daily) being the universal "Bomb these fuckers over here" call for air support.
I mean, if you manage to get the US, China, and Russia all to work towards the single goal of wiping you off the face of the earth, you've probably fucked up hard. 
ISIS is trying to instigate the apocalypse by angering the world powers, but really all they're doing is instigating their own quick demise.
In other news ISIS joins forces with Cobra, The decepticons, The legion of doom, Bowser and Darth vader to form the super axis of evil and piss everyone off... Even in other realities.
Did ISIS just assemble the international Avengers?
Stop calling them ISIS and stop calling them Islamic. They are Daesh and they are a death cult.
Plot twist: ISIS just wants to bring everyone together.
China won't get involved in a quagmire  war. It is a huge mistake if they do and they realize that, will be an existinel threat to the regime if the country is stuck in a unpopular war. China won't attack unless their trade routes are seriously threatened, civilian lives are expendable. Also the mirror is a rag tag crap source similar to the NY post and the dailymail, not sure why it is getting posted on here so much.
Unless people are sending ground troops, this is all bullshit for show.
People say, "this is exactly what ISIS wants."  Let's say all Islamists end up joining ISIS in retaliation to civilian casualties, bigotry, or they see their old world  way of life is going away.  They all start fighting as a whole rather than extremists, and very promptly they are defeated as a whole by all of the world super powers.  Most if not all of the Muslim faith end up being killed.  Is that really what they want to happen?  To be the victims of a genocide?  

They will never have enough power to actually go toe to toe with everyone. So what is their end game?
ELI5: After all the attacks, all big nations declared war on ISIS and started attacking them directly. What exactly did they win? And why the hell would they want to draw so much attention for small gains? 
Let me be the voice of dissent in this, and say that its convenient for China to get into this war where every other superpower already has stakes, kinda like East Germany/west Germany type of thing.

We could very well be witnessing one of the worlds largest covert land grabs of the 21st century.
So, we have the Big Five working together for the first time in 70 years. Is this badass or what?
So is there any way to know we've actually finished off ISIS? Or is this one of those wars that never ends again...?
All in favor for Waswas?
Can I get a more reliable news source?
Terrorism is asymmetrical warfare. If you don't grasp that fact well... I don't know what to do for you.
"China declares war.." I almost had a heart attack.
Looking forward to the US, Russia, France, China and their allies putting pressure on Turkey to stop propping up ISIS! Oh, no? Ok, carry on then :)
At this rate even North Korea is gunna be like "damn, these guys suck".
So who is gonna get boots on the ground first?

because right now it's looking like a big fat NOBODY. Which is a farce. You're not going to bomb this group into submission, this self proclaimed caliph would be a fool if he hadn't prepared for that.
Well done ISIS, never before in mankinds history have so many people been at war with so few. You are qell and truly fucked now. Russians are bad sure, and americans bomb shit. Us in the UK will mostly debate over whats happening and france will likely send in the legion. But china are fucking crazy. They will level your shit and build a dam on it. 
a world world war where everybody wins?


They sell the onions and chick peas here in Ireland for 49 cents at offer. always clear them out when I get the chance

Pissed off China .... They poked the panda bear.
Now Isis is fucked
Well, they've wanted a "jihad". I guess the Muslims, or those who seek to fight, are going to get one!

:-)
sounds like the middle east is going to be a much more complicated 21st century Berlin.
I'm just curious,

I'm having a lot of trouble finding any other new reports on this. can someone else confirm? Not to be "THAT GUY" but this is a big deal and I want to be sure.
So WW3 is the planet uniting against a common enemy of terrorists. 

Maybe, ultimately, the outcome will be for the better?
Turning into a WWE match "Wait, is that China's music! IT IS!"
What is ISIS really trying to achieve? Piss off the whole world?
So maybe a Proletarian Atheist China style government could do the theocratic Middle East some good?
Command and Conquer Generals foresaw this.  China will grow larger
I wish they would photoshop ISIS leaders in to gay porn.
What if they are just trying to unite the world for world peace? And all the people they "executed" are just hanging out Chillin in the back of an el Camino 
We got the band back together 
Welp, we've found our ground forces.
ISIS=GLA stealth general
What's next? They piss off North Korea?
In a strange turn of events, it seems ISIS is bringing everyone closer together
It happened, Command and Conquer: Generals is no longer fiction.
In my experience, nothing brings allies together better than beating the shit out of enemies together.

This will be the last thing IS ever do - attack Chinese citizens. Stupid finds its way out of the gene pool at last. China is a powerful nation with no record of respect for human rights. China executes political prisoners and then harvests their organs.

IS meet China. China, meet lunch.
Thousands of comments and 99% of the people leaving them didn't even read or investigate the claims of this article. The title by the original poster is a lie, China has not "declared" war on ISIS. They are not sending in forces to engage in a war with ISIS. No other article out there even comes to close what is claimed.
"The world will quake, when China wakes" - Napoleon
Unfortunately, these wars and there declarations are basically only sharp reprimands. Nothing comes of this, it's a shame
I dont think these guys understand the countries they keep fucking with.  China and Russia will fuck you in the ass.
Good luck combatting an ideology.
Great, a country that likes killing people joins the other countries that like killing people to fight a group that likes killing people.
I just dont get these morons at ISIS. Not sure if they are just dumb or inbreed. But they are uniting all the big countries against them. America, Russian, China.

Thats just a whole new level of stupid.

If anything good comes out of this whole things, its a strengthened trust and alliance between the west and other countries working together against a common scum foe.
The red dragon awakens.

This is like ISIS getting the IRL equivalent of a 5-star wanted level.
When you get China, Al Qaeda, the US, Russia, France, Assad, Iraqis, Iranians, Saudis, Kurds of all stripes, and Hezbollah all teaming up to take you out, you have **royally** fucked up and you're just plain gonna die.
[deleted]
Are these guys retarded? like have they not played Risk before? they only control a small part of the middle east and starting a war with 4 continents?
If they're objective was to get as many super powers as possible coming to kill them they've succeeded masterfully.
Raq city, bitch, Raq, Raq City Bitch

French, Russian, bombers blowing up your city bitch

China come 1.3 bil deep, V.I.P. no guest list

Daesh you don't know who you fucking with?
 
Why is 'execute Chinese hostage' in quotations? That's what fucking happened, are they trying to make it look like an incorrect profession on China's part or what? It's what happened.
There was a norwegian fella they killed too, but I haven't even heard anyone talk about him over here, it's like nobody gives a shit 
So ISIS should be defeated within the next few months then.

With the 3 world superpowers now declaring war on them + all the other nations fighting them it should be done and dusted pretty quick.

Or are the 3 so called 'superpowers ' unable to defeat a moderately equipped, not fully organised militia ?
You need intelligence to fight a war oversea. I doubt China is going to reallocate their asset to Middle East.
The crazy thing is that this is exactly what Daesh wants...
Burning foreign soldier alive in a cage wasn't enough to get all countries involved... But fine they are now we will take it
Woo, go wildcard, go!
Seems like this is going according to ISIS's plan of ushering in the apocalypse and being saved by Jesus.  
good guy ISIS: unites all the superpowers of the world 
Glad to see their eyes have finally opened.
&gt; Xi also today condemned the "cruel and savage" attack by militants on a hotel in Mali's capital that killed more than people yesterday, including three executives from a Chinese railway company.

Confirmed: Executives are indeed more than people.
"ACTIVATING LIBERTY PRIME!" "INITIATING DIRECTIVE #7395: DESTROY ALL TERRORISTS!"
ISIS is about to experience a superpower gangbang. 
It's sad to say but most of these countries only started caring until one of their own gets killed
Wouldn't it be ironic if with their message of near universal hate ISIS actually turns out to be the one force that can actually unite the world under a single goal, leading to increased funding in space programs and altogether world peace
Next week: North Korea declares war on ISIS
ITS HAPPENING
SONS OF THE PATRIOTS
'We condemn these inhuman and violent actions'
Anyone else think this is a bit ironic remark from China's government
Sweet sweet irony.  Terrorism is the best thing that has happened to the international community since the invention of the olympics
Wait until tomorrow if the Survivor Series rumors are true... They will the worlds other super power after them, Brock Lesnar.
When does Gandhi come in all pissed??
[Now You Fucked Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGp9P6QvMjY)
This is getting REAL weird.
What's the likelihood of a UN coalition like everyone here is hoping for? If the US is attacked, I'm sure we'll put boots on the ground, but what's the likelihood that the security Council will ally together like in the korean war?
I'm wondering how the "superpowers" will go about post-ISIS Syria and Iraq, specifically, who controls or has their "sphere of influence" of the region. This is the part that concerns me deeply. 

This appears to be an opportunity for a power grab by other countries (Russia/China) in the region which is currently "influenced" heavily by western forces. I don't believe that the western countries are willing to give up their influence, given Washington's interest in ousting Assad for a more pro-western leader. 

Ahh I'm getting so excited to finally bomb them.
I just can't wait to see the South Park Episode.
ISIS was fighting the governments. Now they're fighting the people.
Maybe ISIS will bring about world peace as the whole world unites to destroy them.
This is shaping up to be the most one-sided world war ever
And you declare war on ISIS and you declare war on ISIS. Everyone declares war on ISIS!!!
Does anyone have an actual source in either Chinese or English in which Jinping declares war on Daesh/ISIS? I have not seen it on this link or any other through Google and Baidu Searches.
So America, Russia, and China are all pissed at them now....This should be when ISIS sprints away screaming "it was just a prank, it was just a prank"
Why not let ISIS unite all of the various shitty little terror organizations into one thing and consolidate power under one flag and then buy off their leadership/kill their leader and put in one we like? Isn't that the mentality behind not disbanding drug cartels/mafias? Because all the little splinter groups would be much harder to track and control? Let them grow just enough and then fight not to destroy them, but to keep them as one big, easy to follow problem instead of a million tiny complex ones.... I donno.
Who ever wins takes the oil
They're really pissing off a lot of people that really shouldn't be fucked with...
Americans have already declared war on them, so has France. But,  leave it to the Chinese to cut in line. 
If only these guys would step out of 15th century world and enter the 21st century, they'll realize the world is WITH them instead of them thinking everyone is against them. 

People aren't fighting them as they think and that they have to respond. 

They're fighting the people who've moved onto the 21st century.

Just join us instead
Xianjiang poses more of a threat to China than Syria tbh.
I know this is far fetched but doesn't this seem like a realistic version of Watchmen? 
Finally the worlds largest super powers have a common enemy? Maybe this will lead to Type 1 civilization? Who knows, I just hope something positive comes out of all this hostility. 
**is there any source other than the mirror**


**there is nothing on the entire internet other than the mirror**
Good. 

Let's find them, and fuck em' up. 
Ah, ISIS is just trying to bring the world together.  That's sweet.
FUCK YEAH. AMERICA, RUSSIA, AND CHINA WORKING TOGETHER!
The war of 5 armies....
ISIS is pure evil.
Gotta love how ISIS can unite the world.
Can anyone tell me how ISIS is still a thing?   
How have they not been bombed to smithereens by now? 
So basically Isis is lelouch and is actually trying to reunite the world ?
Next thing you know, ISIS will be going in against a Sicilian when death is on the line.
Has China been actually involved in an armed conflict in the last....40 years?

I know they have a large army and spend money on it, but do they have any real world experience?

I would be interesting to see how efficient they actually are in a war.

It's like the Boxer Rebellion part 2 
Except China gets to join the world powers in seeing who can solve the problem the best.

Boxer Rebellion was Britain, France, Germany, America, Russia, Japan vs the Chinese. Just before World War I.
World War 3 is going to be the whole world against the Islamic State.

Very different than how Star Trek said it would go.
Somewhere, in some cave, the leader of ISIS has almost completed his master plan of creating an evil terrorist organization capable of uniting the world's nuclear powers against a common foe. The sacrifices were many but world peace is almost at hand...

Right guys?
I'm trying to find more info on this but so far, only Mirror seems to be the one reporting it. Every other places put Mirror as their source. I'm skeptical about this. 
I picture a bunch of terrorists sitting around a table...

"We pissed off the United states!"

"Bahhh... That is nothing. Our cell pissed off Russia."

"Russians are easy to piss off. We pissed off the French."

*gasps all around*

"Impressive work, my friend. We are trying for Canada"

"You're mad!" "It cannot be done!" "No!" "Canada?! That is impossible!"

Then, a bomb drops on them and they all go to hell.
So basically it's an unannounced World War... Three continents at war with Daesh.
Hell to the m-fucking yeah!
"You know what would be a good idea? Lets piss off every major world power! That couldnt end poorly!" ~ISIS
Funny how the same people who were against invading countries to take out Osama are for taking out ISIS
What if ISIS is just part of a world plot to literally unite the countries of earth into one government/religion/armed forces, literally a New World Order.
It sure takes a lot for China to take notice of anything going on outside of their own sphere.  Kind of reminiscent of American isolationism at the start of the 20th century.  
So now the countries fighting proxy wars have to unite to go to war with their proxies. 
The real issue is going to be figuring out who gets to install a proxy, client government that upholds their influence and interests. ISIS has never been a big issue in the Syrian war - it's not today either.

China entering the scene would be huge news though. It would mean they are shifting roles into a more active world government.
the scary thing here is that China could literally do a kung-fu zerg rush and still win by shear weight of numbers, if they were that crazy, stupid, and heartless to do it.
ISIS strategy -

 Same as me in Civ 3: Piss off *everyone*
Ironically, human history has shown we are more then willing to forgive when we all hate the same person. 

Rome, Mongols, Nazis, and now ISIS. All gave us a chance to say "You know what, I really don't like you sure, but we BOTH fucking hate that other guy. We cool so we can kick his shit in?".

I look forward to seeing this further strengthen the global community. 
This is slowly turning into Naruto... Isis is the Akatsuki
But we already have Linda.
They've pissed off wayy too many world superpowers. R.I.P ISIS (AKA Daesh). Fuck those people.
Does this technically put us in WW3? USA, France, China, Russia all attacking the same group?
Just waiting for North Korea to declare "war" on ISIS
Plot twist: ISIS tries to bring world peace by making countries unite against them.
This is what I like. The world super powers working together to defeat an enemy
You got the Western Allies, Russia, and China all working towards the same goal.  
  
Thanks ISIS.  Instead of destroying those who oppose your version of Islam, you're just bringing countries with sordid histories together.  This common bond will be very helpful in the future after you're wiped out.
How dare ISIS execute a Chinese citizen. Don't they know that only China can execute the Chinese?
This is exactly what ISIS wants, the more countries against them the closer they think they are to fulfilling the Dabiq Prophecy.

http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/markaz/posts/2014/10/03-isis-apocalyptic-showdown-syria-mccants


ISIS might be assholes, but at least they are uniting the world together.
Between all of Europe, the US, UK and China it's just going to be a race for who nukes them first. How sad that realsiation is is beyond comprehension.
This is starting to feel like all the enemies of the Federation joining forces with Starfleet against the Borg.  
To quote Metallica, "kill em all"
Looks like Isis is trying to unite the world against it.
ISIS is like that kid in class who can't shut the fuck up and pisses all the wrong people off.
Good. Fuck em'
Is ISIS really that retarded that they want to start shit with everyone?
China, Russia, United States, France, England and a bunch of other countries. At this stage I would not feel save anywhere in Syria or Iraq if I was Daesh. I am now awaiting for the biggest can of whoopass anybody has ever received. Fucking with Russia was already bad...fucking with China means these guys are not going to get killed...they are going to be very painfully eradicated
Man it seems like EVERYONE hates ISIS except other middle eastern countries 
Yeah, it's China's job to execute their own people!
It just gets more and more bizarre and shows just how little we (the public) know about them.  Or maybe just how little I know about them.  I've seen the new clips.  It looks like a bunch of guys in the desert with machine guns.  And you have almost every world power going after them now.  Just seems really bizarre. 
Now waiting for Scientology to release a statement detailing their ban on Russia in their typical "me too!" fashion.
Did *anybody* read the *four paragraph* long link?


&gt;A court **in Moscow** has banned the **local branch** of the Church of Scientology


Even the auto suggest title for this link doesn't say "Russia Bans Scientology". People below are talking about "more countries banning scientology". Reddit is a joke.
Russia is about to be hit with the most baddest spy that Scientology has to offer.

Btw he can do impossible missions.
Good.

Many years ago I worked at a job agency. The scientologists were constantly trying to get us to take their "vacancies", which we refused to do - they would contact on average at least once a month. The advice from our legal advisors was that their contract of employment was not a valid contract at all, in fact it was a contract for slavery. Among other things, they required staff to send their children to a Scientology School, and not to consult a medically qualified doctor in the event of illness or injury to themselves to their family members, only their Scientology advisor.
Was a program on cults today on the radio, laughed my ass off when I heard Scientology haves you PAY to get the "next level" of divine knowledge. Original pay2win. Though you don't win.
First ISIS, then Scientology? Russia isn't taking shit from anybody.
The last thing the hard-working people of Russia need to spend their already weakened rubles on is this scam. Good move. 
Hope more countries start doing this. 
Russia gets to do all the stuff we wish we could do in the US but can't because of all our freedom: Ban stupid shit that's obviously stupid, bomb the hell out of terrorists with no political repercussions, fight bears, etc...

That awkward moment when you live in Russia and learn about Scientology ban on Reddit
**A lot of people have no idea what Scientology is. Let me tell you...**

L. Ron Hubbard was the founder of Scientology.

Hubbard wrote fiction for many years, and published stories in some of the most popular magazines of the era.  During that time, Hubbard began researching in psychology and psychiatry-like methods.  He was playing mind games.  He eventually wrote a book about it, called **Dianetics**: *The Modern Science of Mental Health*.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics:_The_Modern_Science_of_Mental_Health

Dianetics is the name of the technique Hubbard gave his work.  He was using "Dianetics" when he used these specific techniques to play with the human mind.  Dianetics deals with the mind, and the mind is a physical thing.  Some people began using Dianetics, and eventually became fanatics.  After all, Dianetics was a best-seller at the time, and was one of the very first self-help books.  These fanatic formed a religion around the works and writings of L. Ron Hubbard.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Scientology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Scientology

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_in_the_United_States

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_in_Canada



When Hubbard assumed that he was dealing with spiritual problems instead of purely mental ones, he realized that his self-help techniques were healing people of their spiritual ills.  Thus, Scientology was born, given a new name to reflect a more accurate description of his work.  He also wanted to scam the government for taxes, and since churches don't have to pay taxes he claimed that Scientology was a religion.  Since it dealt with the spirit and not just the mind, Scientology was deemed a religion by a few of the world's governments, and in some countries they don't have to pay taxes.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology_controversies

Hubbard was a wise con man, and he knew what he was doing.  He kept writing more books and recording more incoherent lectures on cassette tapes.   These were to be his teachings, and Scientology uses them like Bibles.  The technique of Hubbard is sacred, and his writings are the teachings of his technique, etc etc.

So, what do they believe?  Well... those spiritual problems I talked about are the very core of their beliefs.  Also, memories.

They believe you have two parts to your mind.  The Analytical Mind, the one that uses reasoning and works sort of like a computer, being logical.  The other part is the Reactive Mind, where subconscious thoughts are stored and recorded, which can later be recalled through what Scientologists call "auditing", which means to listen.  Talk therapy, essentially.  Also considered spiritual counseling by Scientologists.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_mind

Anyway, the brain can record negative thoughts in the Reactive Mind and have a negative impact on your life.  What they don't tell the public, or the people who have not climbed the church's levels (by taking auditing courses), is that these memories are often implanted memories.  Implanted by aliens in another life time, in another part of the galaxy.  This is where the Xenu story you hear about comes into action.  Xenu, who was an intergalactic ruler, killed many people by dropping atomic bombs in volcanoes.  Then, the spirits of these alien beings, also called "Thetans" by Scientology, roam the earth.  They can cling to your body, and those are called Body Thetans, or BTs in Scientology jargon.  These BTs can cluster, and then you have many, many infected alien spirits trying to harm you or causing pain in your life.  You can use auditing to rid yourself of these evil spirits, who are basically Scientology's version of demons.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditing_%28Scientology%29

They do this to become a state of "clear".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear_%28Scientology%29

Scientology has formed many organizations and corporations.  They are a big business, and not really a religion at all.  Sure, they claim to deal with the spirit, but it is very obvious to anyone that L. Ron Hubbard made up stories about his work.  He was a con man, and his friends were all on record saying that he was out to make money.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Scientology_organizations

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Scientology_organizations

Many people claim Dianetics and Scientology make them feel better.  Maybe it does, but who cares?  It's a crazy UFO cult.  To be honest, it's almost as crazy as Christianity.

**Watch these videos. Learn what this insidious cult is all about.**

The upvotes were well over 10,000 about an hour ago. What happened?
First they came for the Scientologists.... and I applauded that, but then....
I swear Putin (Yes I know he isn't the whole government) is like that scary biker dude who you see around town who's actually pretty cool but also fucking terrifying.

EDIT: Yes thank you for all the people who pointed out Putin has done bad stuff, I thought by saying he can be scary that I was addressing that. Wasn't saying he is a perfect guy, just at times had done some cool things. 
Surprised no one has mentioned the HBO Documentary 'Going Clear'. Knowing what I know about Scientology, i'm surprised at the amount of people in this thread referring to Scientology as a religion.

Scientology is not a religion. It's a criminal organization, a scam, and a corporation that literally intimidated the United States into leaving it alone.

'Going Clear' will explain this better than I can, though.
Russia hasn't banned anything, what a shitty title. A court in Moscow has banned a local branch of Scientology in its diocese. 

Fuck you, Reddit. 
Wow.  ISIS attacks Russia.  Russia bans Scientology.  Scientology bans psychiatry. Psychiatry treats the mentally deranged.  The mentally deranged join ISIS.   Kevin Bacon.

I have no idea where this is going.
2 hours ago this had 10k up votes, now 8k? Hrrmmm, who would mass down vote a post about Scientology being banned.
Funny how everyone is cheering, but if this were a ban on islam everyone would be up in arms. 
Good, scientology is for retards anyways.
Religion freedom means being free to choose bad religions, even financial scams masquerading as religions. You cannot have one without the other.

So while I cheer for the blow to Scientology, I am sadden by the blow to freedom. 
Scientology is a cult in most of Western Europe too.
Good riddance. These organizations should be purged from Europe entirely.
I just noticed the amount of downvotes this post is receiving. The upvotes were around 10k+ about an hour ago and they have dropped by about 1.5k-2k. That's crazy!
I really really want to like this... trust me, I really do but I can't because I believe in religious freedom.

I'm an Atheist btw (because I have a feeling someone's going to say something about that/assume I'm a Christian or something.)
South park hit the nail on the head with that episode.
Russia just keeps getting better and better
Didn't this thread had more than 10000 upvotes?? Is scientology downvoting?
This gonna make Lord Xlerob angry
So let me get this straight, Russia bans Scientology and everyone on Reddit cheers.  Someone mentions a ban on Islam and suddenly you are a no good Islamaphobe and you're down voted to oblivion.
Why are the upvotes dropping? Just 30 mins ago this was at 9000, now at 7800?
Reddit: where banning ideologies is great as long as its not yours.
Give it time, their lawyers just found out.
Next ban wahabi and salafi islam, please.
Good riddance
I was the ten thousandth upvote. Just so everyone know
Didn't this post just have around 10,200 up votes like an hour ago?

Did Scientology send over their minions to downvote it?
respek 
They got a Redditor making all these decisions in Russia giving away puppies banning Scientology. 
Crap article,  great news. 
Excellent. I needed some good news this week. 

It's a dangerous cult! 
In the UK people can be banned from entry for associating with Scientology, as its personnel and activities run 'contrary to the public good'. See van Duyn v. Home Office (1974). 
good. a ridiculous religion.
People have so much to say on an article they haven't even read. Moscow banned a local branch. Not the entire cult.
The OP probably could have put the link to pornhub. and people would have commented and up voted, not even caring.
Not every day you see Russia being one of the more progressive countries, good on them. Now stop abusing gay people. Please.
Met a beautiful chick, everything was fine... UNTIL. She said, "I am a Scientologist."
A fantastic decision. More nations should take heed.
This post had over 10k upvotes at one point. How many scientologists are hiding here downvoting? 600ish? 
Scientilogists in Russia are horrible compared to here. They set up fake drug rehab centers where instead of treating addocts, they actually addict them more and force them to work at construction sites owned by them for no money. They are horrible.
Why does everyone hate Scientology? I'm not trying to be a smartass, I have NO IDEA what Scientology even is. 
Looks like they're Putin an end to Scientology...eh? Eh?
Don't stop there!
well done!


Aren't they considered a cult in some other countries?
My country, Canada, is too scared to ban Scientology. We embrace it here just like Christianity and Islam. It's disgusting. 

Good on you Russia!
Why isnt this in /r/upliftingnews?
This post belongs in /r/upliftingnews 
I'm conflicted. on one hand I don't like scientology because they're basically a cult with an unsettling amount of power. However this is also a blatant disregard for religious freedoms in Russia, which most would say religious freedom is a basic human right and inherently good. Just an observation.
I'm liking Russia more and more every day. Good job on that Trololo guy too. 
Ok, quick question: Who here thinks Scientology is  religion &amp; who thinks it is a cult?

Personally I go with cult, cos as far as being a religion, they're not even trying. I mean c'mon aliens &amp; shit, get the fuck outta here.

Russia is going to start bombing Scientology and tell everyone they are actually bombing ISIS.
I live in Hollywood and I wish it was banned here too 
- 2007, European Court of Human Rights rules against Russia for repeatedly refusing to grant church of Scientology status of valid religious organisation.
- 2008, 2 of the church's branches are closed down for engaging in unlicensed health care services.
- 2009, European Court of Human Rights rules against Russia once again for denying the church status of religious organisation. Church is awarded €20,000 in costs and damages.
- 2010, some of L. Ron Hubbard's works included into federal list of banned extremist materials.
- 2011, these works are removed from the list.
- 2011, another unsuccessful attempt to include these works into the list is made.
- 2015, Russian court bans Church of Scientology because it is 'not a religion', on the grounds that because the organisation had tried to register "Scientology" as a trademark it could not, therefore, be a religious body. The city's court has now ruled that the organisation must set up a commission to oversee its liquidation, and this must be completed within six months.

Reposted with his/her permission.
Russia actually did something logical for once. 
once again news being as accurate as stormtroopers.
Truth is Scientology is being banned from list of religous organisations so they would not take tax advantages as christian church and others.
And reading your topic let me think all scientologists in Russia have been shot by Putin himself.

I am anti Scientology, but I believe people should have the right to practice any religion.
Religions should never be banned. Cults should. Good bye and good riddance, Scam-i-tology. 
Russian propaganda outlet at the top of worldnews. Welp.

P.S. And the post's approval rating (98%) isn't suspicious at all.

P.P.S. as a person who grew up in Moscow, I'm pretty sure scientology is a non-issue in Russia. Russian Orthodox Church, now that is an issue of a 'secular' state. Tobacco peddlers with tax exemptions.
So this post has 10k+ upvotes now, mostly positive reaction. I wonder how people would feel if the headline read "Russia bans [insert major world religion here]"
Perhaps supporting an authoritarian infringement of rights is the hip new thing in our liberal age, but I can't understand why everyone is cheering this on in the comments. 

People should have a right to religious, ideological, and other thought-based freedoms, regardless of how ignorant or debased they are.

EDIT: Because people seem to be defending this ban on the basis that "Scientology is a cult not a religion that destroys families etc.", let me be clear: even cults, neo-Nazis and the KKK deserve protection. Freedom of expression, speech, ideology and religion exist to protect the offensive and absurd. That's all there is to it. 
This thread is genuinely scary. For all the talk of free speech and freedom of religion and censorship, you all cheer when something you personally disagree with is censored.
No need for this.  People should be allowed to believe what they want.  Some people might have silly beliefs, but we don't need a thought police.
Ahh the ever tolerant Reddit crowd.

I don't like something or agree with something someone else believes; BAN IT!!!!!

Fucking pussies, can't just let people be, gotta get all offended and upset over something someone else believes and dictate over them.

Ya'll act like you are liberals but clearly you love authority and being dictators.
Reddit is so fucking retarded when it comes to Russia. One month it's the worst country on the planet and now everyone wants to give Putin a handy.


Edit: join the circlejerk below
Go Russia!

- Russia wacks the shit out of ISIS

- Russia bans Scientology -  not even a religion or a cult but a blatant scam designed to extract money from people.

Can't wait for the next headline...
I love how Reddit constantly bangs on about how our freedom of speech is constantly being curbed and attacked, until it's a group Reddit doesn't like.
I'm for having the freedom to choose your religion or lack of it.  So this does make me sad in that regard.  Although I do hate scientology but I hate lack of freedom more.
You know what this is? A great start! Simply Awesome.
I'm the 10000th upvote. Where's my prize?
Good i hope the united states soon follows suit. Scientology is not a faith it is a cult, the higher ups in the "relegation" use it to make money by fooling rich sods with these "health" routines to check your soul or some shit and a bunch of other sketchy shit. 

You can can say other religion's are are sketchy but when i left the catholic church my priest didn't hunt me down and try to make my life hell he just said "ah fuck it" and went to mass. 
The only difference between a cult and a religion is that the guy who knew the religion was a scam is dead.
So reddit is heralding the outright violation of the freedoms of religion and association?
1. Religion - open and non-secretive with equal access to the same information; more emphasis on the individual over the collective group; recruits through conversion and inheritance

2. Cult - secretive and often contains tiers of insider information; more emphasis on the collective group than the individual; recruits through deception and forced coercion
I hope America sees this and does it too... Russia, Germany and I'm sure other countries have taken an official stance against Scientology. Time for us, the U.S. to do the same 
I love the hypocrisy of reddit. On the one hand, people love to criticize safe spaces and trigger warnings and go on self righteous rants on the importance of free speech. On the other, it wants scientology banned, encourages the media to hide details of mass shootings, and loves the removal of ISIS social media accounts.
As much as I disagree with their beliefs. This is not good. Religious freedom should be a thing 
Operation: Baba Yaga
Damn, with them going against ISIS and now banning a corporate cult Russia is really raking in freedom points. 
Good. It's nothing but man-made nonsense. Its teachings are absolutely ludicrous. 
There is a good side of totalitarism like banning destructive bullshit despite them "playing cool" and being rich.

I hope total nationwide ban will be implemented.
Although I must say that it was 1996 when russians first time claimed Scientology a destructive group, but back then there was no real power in state to implement it despite briberies and trickery.  Good job soviet Russia
The new PR guy for Russia is doing a great job.
Really, 8million members?  How can that many people be so stupid...
I like Russia more and more
Ok now let's do the same elsewhere on Earth.
And nothing of value was lost.
This is like the 4th story in a week that made me like Russia. 

Am I going to have to start being jealous of them? 
I really like this passive aggressive sentence: "Scientology, which reportedly has eight million members worldwide, is considered to be a religion in some countries."
How is this possible? Scientology is great at paying people off, did they miss someone?
I hope Putin can still enter the primary
Probably doesn't help that the scientologists were assassinating journalists and scientists that opposed them..and thats Putin's job.

Islam next please
Good. That Miscaviage guy looks like a walking punching/douche bag. I hope he now enjoys a sub-par Thanksgiving.
About time
Why are the scores hidden?
It's weird (but great) to hear of Russia doing positive things.
I don't think Russia has been much of a trendsetter but let's hope that changes, at least this time
At least they're doing something right 
Putin is just winning this year he doesn't take crap from anybody. 
Well at least they did one thing right.
Wow, Russia beats the USA in this ban. I still wonder with amazement how it is still considered a religion anywhere but in hell.
I like Russia more and more
Fuck yeah
South park
Your religion can't be taken seriously if it doesn't overreact to being banned by killing innocent people.
For anyone who hasn't watched it yet, go do the free month trial of hbo now and watch the documentary going clear. 
Can't wait to hear about Scientology banning Russia next.
In Russia, Scientology forks you!
So are there NO scientologists on Reddit?

As much as we hate them, they get a lot of shit right...
Russia be like "Sue me! Sue me!" Scientology be like "You're soooo sued!!!"
Next, Herbalife.

Good
Always surprised that people actually believe in Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard even said that he set it up to make money.  
In Russia is easy to get things done.
Russia's being kind of cool lately. 
There is something admirable about the Russians.
Haha this is for Tom Cruise blowing up their Kremlin.
Wouldn't be the first time Putin dropped a bomb on radicals.
Russia, China and Japan are more realistic about human nature. What I see in the west is a complete detachment from reality.  The west is on top right now but that may not last. America is becoming increasingly divided.  Merkel is reshaping Europe's demographics.  If she thinks the immigrants will feel gratitude then she is wrong. Humans are competitive by nature. Everyone wants their race/tribe/ethnicity on top. 
In Russia, thetans clear you!

Fuck scientologist morons.

Fuck the traitor to the American people, Fred T. Goldberg Jr, the weakest little scrot of a subhuman mewling shit of a bastard that flushed away a headache using _BILLIONS_ of tax payers rightful dollars, and giving that money so messed up brainwashed flotsam of society could hurt other vulnerable people.

Fred T. Goldberg Jr: Fuck you. Fuck you, you traitor.

Do your job.
Well, Xenu will NOT be pleased with this!
Could someone explain to me TLDR what scientology is? and what this means?
Russia is about to get the shit sued out of them. 
The Ruskies risk feeling the wrath of Xenu for this bald-faced blasphemy.
good
Anyone in this thread who says this is good is as dumb as the people who say we should ban Islam in the United States. Freedom of Religion is fundamental to a free state. I have no love for Scientology, but it is not up to me to decide what is a religion.
See, how hard was that?  Now onto the other wacko cults that cause all our wars.
Putin's PR has been steadily rising in the last few months. First the strikes on ISIS, now this.
Can we get 10000 upvotes?
Xenu does not approve.
Lived in Russia next to a scientology hq in Moscow. Notice my sexy word choice.
Welp. Looks like Putin is about to be killed by one of them.
Huh. No surprise. But still....
Not so much banned, just failed to meet the criteria to be legally recognized as a religion. Can't say this surprises me, Russia doesn't seem a place where shit often flies.
Holy upvotes!
Everyone on here used to despise Russia just a few months back but now all of a sudden are getting a massive freedom boner for them just within the last few weeks. Curious to see how long it lasts.
Damn son... I don't think I've ever seen a post on reddit with over 10,000 upvotes before? Doesn't reddit have algorithms to cap posts at around 7-8k upvotes?
Reddit really needs to consider making room for a 5th digit in the upvote count.
As the days go on I find myself liking Putin. Which is weird as fuck. 
Russia banning anything for the sake of "freedom" is the ironiest thing I've read in a while
Unitoligist bastards ;)
We can trust the Russians to define what's a religion and what isn't right?  Totally wouldn't end up with only the Russian Orthodox Church.
What happens to the building? It looks even cooler than Putin's new multi-billion command center
Whoever is in charge of Russia's PR is doing a great job.  
Galactic Dictator Xenu is goin' be pissed!
I'm liking the Russians much more than the phony in the white house!  Never thought I'd be thinking that!
Awesome
The I like Russia...aside from the whole cold war thing...but they just don't fuck around.
I volunteer /r/unitedkingdom to ban Scientology next. Please.
Remember back when the Romans banned a religion?  Worked out great for then huh?

(Not that I'm a supporter of scientology or anything, I just don't think banning it will do much)
I guess you can say Russia won't be Putin up with it.
Im delighted the miscavige is having a bad day.
10K upvotes in 4 hours? holy shit son

good. 
Nice! Now for Islam 
There is an "in Soviet Russia..." joke here somwhere.
...This just in, Scientology sues Russia.
I am still stunned by the fact that some people call this cult the "church" of scientology.
Scientology + Russia = 10k points? 

Seems legit.
That's something I actually have to agree on with Putin. 
Hmm I wonder who the bad guys will be in the next Tom Cruise movie..
Good.
This statement is absolutely false and has no source or basis. 
Russians do good things sometimes.
I'm starting to like Russia...
Are they gonna sue Russia now?
Well, good.
I would like to see Putin ban Islam too.

Not because I think it's the end all be all solution, but because I would like to see what would happen and because Putin is the only "Western" leader who is actually powerful enough to do it.
THIS IS FUCKING GREAT
good
10,000th upvote :). Fuck religions

TIL upvotes cap a 10k.
Oh cool, I was the 10,000th, congrats OP, you scored big time with this find.
This is probably the best thing to come out of Russia since Snowden, who has yet to come out of Russia.
Gotta start somewhere. 
There are few things why I like Russia/Russians. This is one of those. Good job.
Meanwhile, people in America are trying to ban mosques...
I swear I saw this post go from 10000+ upvotes to below that in a refresh...
hahahha everyday and in every way im LOVING RUSSIA!
If we could only do that in the US.
Russia, so hot right now.
Whaaaaa? Russia actually does something constructive?!
Well, why is this losing so many upvotes? Some seconds ago we were at 10k upvotes now we are at 9700

Edit: Now it's 9200 upvotes.... seems like Scientoligy has awoken
Huh...  The post was in the 5 digit range of imaginary points and now is down to 9700ish...  Scientologists coming online right about now?
[Vladimir gets it](http://i.imgur.com/bVnv9fE.jpg).
Serious question, has anyone in the US "lost" their family to scientology, and eventually got them back? I have a cousin whom I love very much, and i haven't seen her since my family broke up, and over the past 20 years I guess she joined scientology and no one but my uncle on occasion has heard from her.

Weird question, I know, but since all the docs and books lately, I've been holding out hope to see her again and well.
I'd like to ban John Travolta.  
&gt;As the attackers mowed people down, a police commissioner and his driver, learning from the police radio that they were near the site, sped to the concert hall before more elite teams could get there. The commissioner charged inside, traded fire with a gunman, and took him out of action before retreating so that special-operations teams could assemble.

Not only is that completely badass, he also probably got a look at what they were truly dealing with so that the special forces wouldn't go in there completely blind. 
Damn, the end of that article hurts. 

&gt;Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

&gt;One screen showed a missed call from "Mom."
Wow, this immediately reminded me of my favourite quote: 
&gt;“Bran thought about it. 'Can a man still be brave if he's afraid?'
&gt; 'That is the only time a man can be brave,' his father told him.” 

What a hero.
It was the same in Sweden some weeks ago. They have studied past hostage situations and figured out that before many have died due to waiting for special police to arrive. 

Therefore the tactic now is to go in as quick as possible without delay to eleminate the threat. 


&gt; Eagles of Death Metal band member Jesse Hughes told VICE that a big reason why so many were killed at the theater "is because so many people wouldn't leave their friends."

You simply can't just leave your friends. 
That is one of the better articles I've read about the attacks.  The line about the ringing of all the cell phones...........................wow.
This may be the best article I've read on the attacks. The horror and humanity comes through the descriptions of the mundane...call from mom, chirping of cell phones of dead people, using a refrigerator as a barricade, carrying one another to safety and running into the chaos alone to confront evil. Well done.
His name? Jacques Gôrdon.

Edit: I'm so sorry if this confused anybody. I just assumed all of Reddit would get the Jim Gordon/Batman joke. I looked for the real commissioner's name but they don't mention it in the article. But the joke *was* meant as a compliment about the virtue of this man's character and bravery. To be called a real-life Jim Gordon is, in my opinion, a great thing.
&gt; One screen showed a missed call from "Mom." 

Of all the things I've read and heard about this tragedy, I think this might be the most powerful. It's truly heartbreaking.
Damn, this guy is a certified badass. I hope he gets the recognition he deserves.
I applaud this gentlemen. 

The balls it must take to charge in blindly to save the people in your city.

What a gd hero
He lead by example, with actual lead. Complete respect for this man. He no doubt saved more lives that night by taking out one of them.
Samuel L. Jackson should send this man a wallet.
And thankfully these operators arrived promptly:

http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/paris-terror-attacks/paris-attacks-commando-captain-shares-details-france-raids-n466461

#BAMF.
"Suddenly, the drum beats gave way to a different kind of rat-a-tat-tat-tat" 

I agree with other comments that this article has some poignant moments, but this is one of the worst lines I've read in any article regarding a shooting. 
Is he Commissioner Gordon?
"Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

One screen showed a missed call from "Mom."

Wow... 
Now that is leading by example!
***LEEEEEEROOOOOY***
I just watched an interview of the guy :

-He didn't ran alone, there were 2 BAC (Brigade anti criminalité) officers to go inside.

-He shot a terrorist who was on stage with an hostage. The terrorist asked the hostage to lie down on the ground, ready to execute him. They then decided to shoot him "knowing that if we missed him, he would take us both, since he had superior weapons".

-They shot the terrorist, who groaned, and then activated his explosive belt. They learned later that the hostage survived, he ran through an exit while the terrorist was being shot.
I'm really grateful for articles like this one. As disturbing as it is to read about the mayhem and loss of life that night, it's incredibly heartening to hear about the brave citizens and policemen who put themselves in danger to save others. I have the utmost respect for them. 
The rapid response of armed french police who flooded the area within 20 minutes undoubtedly saved many lives. Hopefully the french will have a renewed respect for their police and the very tough job they are asked to do. The thin blue line is all that stands between the people and anarchy.

This story reminds me an old french TV series: Navarro. The character (named Antoine Navarro, and incarnated by Roger Hanin) is a french police commissioner who is putting himself often in the line of fire.

As soon as I read the article, I thought "Damn, could be Navarro who ran and fought these scumbags and I would not be surprised!".

EDIT: word
the account of that guy who had a discussion with the gunman was bone chilling...


That's the cop that saved my friends. He showed up, shot one of the the terrorists and told everybody to run, because the other shooters were reloading. Probably saved their lives, they were trapped in the corner, in the pit. He only had his service weapon, so he only had so many bullets. When he ran out, he had to retreat to wait for the French version of SWAT. 

This guy and Kevin Vickers need to co-found a 5 man international Justice League consisting of the most badass middle aged law enforcement officers on the planet. Interviews for the remaining three positions ongoing.

All of them will have the same superpower (pistol) and when they aren't headshotting terrorists they will spend their time having prostate exams, eating high fibre cereals and complaining about the poor quality of young terrorists these days.
Nothing but the highest praise for someone who enters a place where he knows there's people with automatic weapons willing to kill him on sight. This guy needs a raise and anonymous medal if he wishes to remain thus.
Guys, this really doesn't fit the narrative of cheese eating surrender monkeys... The internet must be so conflicted right now.
Can someone who has law enforcement training tell me how in this situation if you are in plain clothes are you supposed to distinguish yourself from the bad guy so you won't get shot by other law enforcement personnel?
Javert is not-so-bad sometimes. 
Hope we can stop calling the French cowards and those who surrender now. 
You can only have immense respect for such bravery.
So many of the stories about police are negative - but 90% of the time they are just doing their job; there are certainly some abuses but there is also exceptional bravery.   This police commissioner is an example but it can also just be an ordinary cop confronted with a difficult situation.  

 Like the attack in Texas (over a cartoon)  - the terrorist had automatic weapons and body armor - a cop took him out with a revolver before the massacre could start.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/03/gunmen-shot-dead-in-texas-after-opening-fire-outside-prophet-muhammad-cartoon-show/
The attackers showed up at 9:40. The *rapid* reaction team showed up at 10:15. It took 35 minutes to get assistance to the theater? 
&gt;Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

&gt;One screen showed a missed call from "Mom."

r/sad
Wow, sounds like a real-life Jim Gordon. 
This is a really nice article. Unfortunately, according to the rules of /r/worldnews, this is likely to be removed. 

That last line. That's just... I know others have said so, but... damn. 
I am not trying to make light of the events of that night and that have since occurred but whenever these things happen, I have a real nagging question I want to ask.

Say you're going to the concert on a first date with someone. Or maybe not the first, but assume Florian from the article and his girlfriend just went steady. Their parents don't even know yet. And then this happened.

She's shot, Florian helps save her. Even carries her out of the theatre to safety. That's incredible and he's a hero in his own right. But now what?

Do they have to stay together forever? Will their breakup be one-sided as Florian begs her to remember the Bataclan and all they faced together? Or will they break up amicably and keep the secret between them, calling every once in a while to check up on their old friend, to see how they're coping? 

I just don't know how I would react in this situation and find it absolutely fascinating in a totally morbid way.

Perhaps this stems from a childhood memory. My sister's boyfriend hanged himself and I felt horrible. I always wondered what you do if your boyfriend dies. How long do you have to wait before you can date? Do you change your relationship status on Facebook? And then he died. I felt personally responsible, being a kid and not knowing better. Anyway, it was very interesting to learn how she acted but I don't know if others would do what she did.

Reminds me of the Canadian Sergeant-at-Arms who helped take out a gunman at Parliament. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Vickers
&gt;Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

&gt;One screen showed a missed call from "Mom."

Fuck.
But is he more heroic than Caitlyn Jenner?
The last part of the article really fucked me up. I hope they kill every single one of those bastards.
This might be inappropriate but this made me think of commissioner Gordon. I'm a big batman fan so I guess it comes from a place of respect. All the stories from that night break my heart. 
So, I got down voted for saying this in another post a couple of days ago but I was only half joking when I said it. If we've learned one thing from ISIS attacking Paris it is that the French are not to be fucked with.


Jean Mclaine
The times are confusing as hell to me.. How did the one guy talk to an attacker for a whole hour?
Per on-line translation, "Nous ne pouvons pas attendre des renforts" is French for "NO TIME FOR BACK-UP!"

Incredible.

At the end when it said about all the phones ringing, so many families hoping their friends and relatives are ok really hits you un the feels
This is SOP in the US post-Columbine.  Prior to that our only metric was where armed men storm into a place, take hostages and demand ransom.  In that situation you surround the building and negotiate.  Columbine shifted the focus to an active shooter situation where sitting outside and waiting on backup get's innocent people killed.
If you want to hear these stories, dont *just* hear them when it happens to be in NATO countries.
he knew what he was doing too.Shoot and move...
This guy is a badass.
This man deserves both medals for bravery and the respect of us all. A hero and model for police everywhere!
Hopefully this article permanently dispels the myth that the French are surrendering cowards. This guy has fucking *French balls of adamantium.*
I don't care about heroics. All I can hear is tragedy. It's amazing that people can stand up for good and risk their own lives but the evil that can persist is horrific. I am saddened deeply for the Innocent people whom have died needlessly.
Man that last line hit me hard.
Unnamed sources have said that the police commissioner was out of bubblegum.
Survivor's guilt is a certified badass.
Humans are of two breeds: Those who will fight, and those who will be paralysed by fear and do nothing. There is pretty much nothing you can do to change which you are, its written in your genetic code, and once a bomb explodes near you, you will know which you are.

Guy is obviously the kind of guy who is a fighter.

I'd say the majority of human nature run from life/death situations. The sense of preservation is too strong.
Well it goes without saying; this guy is a hero, and I hope all the anti-gun people saying how "normal" police shouldn't be armed like in the UK actually read this article and try to learn something from it.
I remember when the US was dissing France for not backing the Iraq War, changing French Fries to Freedom Fries. What the hell was that all about?
Shows he didn't get to be comissioner by sitting on his ass. Wow. 
Well, this is what happens when the Ts smoke B and not Mid.
Very brave police officer
He would have done more, but he was tired after dragging his massive balls around for so long.
Thats why he gets paid the big dollars.
Jacque Bauer
Commissionar went Leroy Jenkins on their asses
Shit sounds fake as fuck. I bet he dropped a bunch of one-liners too and slo-mo walked away with his hair blowing in the wind and explosions behind him, but he doesnt even look back. 
after he killed the terrorist he put on sunglasses and said "That's it? Pfft, Jihad to be kidding me!" While smirking and raising his eyebrows up and down.
This Man....IS A BADASS!!!!!!
Jim Gordon?
That's a true leader right there! 
Why are all the pro-gun folks having a field day with this? It's the police commissioner not some average joe who did this, of course he has a gun.
He should be treated as a national hero. 

Hey /u/EmeraldIbis,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Leeeeerroyyyyy jeeeeeenkinns

&gt; oh my god he just ran in
&gt;Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

That's pretty chilling. Hearing any mobile ring after that would probably bring it all back for a while.
Leeroy Jenkins? 
We got a badass mfer here, much respect for the commish
Some Gotham shit going down in Paris
Military police officer here. It doesnt make the commisioners actions any less brave but this is standard operating procedure for active shooter scenarios these days. Most active shooter events are over within five minutes of the first shot. Active shooter scenarios almost always end when the first police make contact with the shooter either by police gunfire or suicide. Obviously the circumstances are somewhat different here but the main point is the longer it takes for any intervention the higher the death toll. 
That is some Commissioner Gordon shit right there. 
The stereotype that French people are sissies is slowly being eradicated. 
This sounds like political propoganda.
They will base movies off of this someday.
Well there goes the anti-gun theory that a single good guy with a gun can't make a difference! 
you know, the terrorist attacks really hurt me personally.  not physically, but they damaged my sense of order and justice in the world, because they introduced confusing fear and chaos.  hearing about this cop is good because it fixes some of the damage that the events have done to my peace of mind, and I will heroize this policeman because it still elts me believe the narrative that good triumphs over evil
Okay that is how you make your subordinates respect you and follow you... What a bad ass!
Was his name Jim Gordon?
Le Commish!
The world needs more people like this...
Dude totally rocks.  
l est le héros qu'ils méritent.
Fucking balls. Out.
Ce mec fucks!
The hero we all need
Great article AP.
So he had a pistol and won a gun fight with a guy with an AK47? 

WHAT A PRO
Reading this article, I realise that death is too good for the people who caused and sponsor this. I want nothing more than them to rot away and slowly go insane in a 1x1 cell for the rest of their pathetic existence.
Le Commish!
Boss
That is by far the best article that I've read on the Bataclan attack.  Ever since it happened I've wondered what the hell went on during the hostage period after the initial attacks happened.  Every story and article I have read prior spoke of the 10-15 minutes of the attack but none of the time that followed until the final police raid.  
The Union of commissioners of national police (SCPN) said that his part the night team of BAC 75. He doesn't want to reveal his identity.

They got in with only hand gun and bullet proof vest, killed 1 terrorist on the first floor who was spraying on hostages, that made the 2 others flee to the upstair level and help the Intervention forces getting in to evacuate the first floor of the venue.
I'll follow that leadership
&gt;One asked him whether he valued money, then held out a roll of bills and told him to burn it. 

These are like real-life Jokers that are somehow even more sociopathic.
Thought for a moment that this was a followup of sorts to what Anonymous announced this weekend about eminent attacks on Sunday.
Can someone link me to other sources about the commisioner story?
 Can only find this article and one from The Times of Israel that says anything about the police commisioner (and its word for word the same article)
 &gt; so many were killed at the theater "is because so many people wouldn't leave their friends."

oh god , I nearly cried reading this. 
I guarantee over the recent events with Paris, Japan, etc... And it being Friday the 13th there going to make a movie about the recent events
He got the 'hero' icon in the Bataclan battlefront map. 
[Direct quote from the Commissioner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rAjily7rME)
How do you say Commissioner Gordon in french?
Jim Gordon???
I'm able to read stuff like this a lot of the time and not have too much of an emotional reaction. I feel for everyone and know it was tragic and horrible, but something in me doesn't give much more than that. Until that last line. Shit like that absolutely tears me apart.
Commissioner "Le-Roy Jaune Kiens" commented on wanting a plate of Cordon Blue after the ordeal.
that last sentence in the article, brutal.
It reminds me more of "Dirty Harry" , when he attacks the hijackers in a plane. Pretty sure the guy had a .357 Manurhin revolver, that is usually what the second line policemen or top brass  carry.
Hes like the real life version of  Commissioner Gordon
"Im getting too old for this shit"
Not sure about the veracity of this, I read nothing  in the french papers about the part about the commissionner
just like in the movies.
So glad he was unharmed on top of doing this so he gets to go home to his family and get honored the way he deserves.
The fire running through his veins...
God fucking damn it. Can we just not fucking kill each other? Yeah, I'm naive, blah blah blah. Fuck you.
Wow this is incredible
I've read my fair share of the attacks and have teared up a bit (I hate that I've become desensitized to hearing about this kind of stuff) but this article broke me. It's just heartbreaking.  
I have a picture of the commissioner that explains why he only killed one terrorist : https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR0Tdak5ntk1FRiKvIfcGZ3nRHda7qSucVBzQUqRjgIQFiSR4GFiQ
fuck.
Reminds me of 9/11's [Orio Palmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orio_Palmer).
truly bad ass

They say he yelled "Vive la France!" before rushing in.
Heroic stories with extra frosting keep popping up 
Need a pic with him, the Canadian guy, and the guys who stopped the attack on the train 
&gt;One screen showed a missed call from "Mom."


Damn.
I bet ya he left the scene when realized that he didn't have enough ammo to combat AKs. Plus he didn't know how many terrorists were there. Once he killed one and saw suicide belts and AK47, he knew he had to leave. 
*IN SELECT THEATERS 2019*
Ballsy. More so than the fucking coward terrorists...
So he's the French Jim Gordon?
Please tell me he was at a nearby restaurant with his mistress. So French. 
Pretty badass
I wonder what Marshal Ney would say
I thought this was posted in r/conspiracy.
What a badass.
The police officers here and the terrorists are the definitions of bravery and cowardice, respectively.
Leadership in its purest form.
Buy that man a beer

&gt; Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

Christ...that would stick with me until the day I died.
Charline, who was at the Bataclan was a massacre.
Real life Jim Gordon :)
Fuck. I love bravery and commitment for a good cause.


Arabs are always accused of , but let's wait for the investigation

Lead by example. A true badass
Can we just name him Gordon... Police Commissioner Gordon, "I AM THE LAW!".
the batman of bataclan.  good for him, not many would have the balls to do what he did.
This alone probably saved a good deal of lives.  This guy is the man.  True hero.
wow...what a display of bravery.

&gt;One screen showed a missed call from "Mom."

My heart...
If you are thinking about making a stupid Jim Gordon analogy, don't.
Woah :o
Does anyone remember the Kenyan mall attack? Special forces took over three hours to enter.
Someone give that man a medal.
The last line got me worst. "Mom" was shown as calling on the cell laying on the floor.
"Not in my city, not on my watch" sort of thing by the sounds of it.


Thats to bad ass that Chuck Norris may have to watch out.

Theres a new bad ass on the block, and he is french!
Sebastien tried to use humor. I think I would have done that too. 
Isis members wanted Suicide by police at bataklan. Did you see that America?
&gt; Some police who moved in after it was all over said they were traumatized by the incessant ringing of cell phones scattered about the debris, blood and corpses, an officer said.

That would've been harrowing, listening to all those people trying to contact loved ones and knowing it was all in vain. 

Damn...
I have heard a somewhat related story  in the hispanic media but I am not sure if it's true, apparently there were some colombian cartel members at a Cafe where one of the attacks occurred, they heard gunfire and thought they were being attacked so they whipped out their guns and killed the terrorists, they were later arrested.
what HBO documentary?
"Mom"... Fuck me
Reminds me of the old days (?), when leaders were at least partially decided on how physically capable they were, and less on being desk jockeys.
Sounds like propaganda that didn't happen. Similar to the "Let's Roll" narrative after 9/11
Was this one day before his retirement? 
.. And that children is how you lead by example.
The real commissioner gordon 
Reminds me of the cop in Columbus when Dimebag got killed.   
&gt;  “all of the provisions that recognize the rights of the public are non-binding, whereas almost everything that benefits rightsholders is binding.”

&gt; The DMCA criminalizes DRM circumvention, which is harsher than a number of other TPP countries’ existing laws.  .......  criminalizing anyone who “circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram.”

Sounds wonderful.


Too bad we're all so thoroughly alienated from the political process that knowing something five years in advance is no proof against it.
We have a system of copyright not to make money for creators but to promote the useful arts and sciences and to allow for a limited time of exclusive production of those works. This extends from the Copyright Clause of our constitution:

&gt;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

In 1790 we had a term of 14 years, renewable once by authors who were alive. Now we have a term of life + 70 years, and we've exported it to most of the world by way of similar trade agreements.

The CTEA and DMCA are functionally unconstitutional by extending the length of copyright retroactively. Taking works whose authors are already dead and about to move into the public domain and extending additional monopoly rights to these works does absolutely nothing to incentivize the production of new works and the very last thing we should be doing is exporting this broken system to the rest of the world.

Worse than that, our broken system doesn't come with one of its redeeming factors and an essential counter-balance: fair use.
Can someone tell me what i will not be able to do on the internet that i currently am able to do? Thanks
I am glad this was addressed last night in the debates.  
The article noted that Philip Morris lost it's litigation in Australia, but after that it reconstituted itself as a Hong Kong company and commenced an [Investor-State Arbitration against Australia](https://www.ag.gov.au/tobaccoplainpackaging) under the Hong Kong - Australia investment treaty. It has cost Australia $50m as at June 2015 and is continuing. Phillip Moriss's strategy is to deter other countries from introducing similar arrangements.
Time to start building our own deepnet networks. Fuck everything about this, I will fight this insanity every way I can, forever.
Looks like I'm going to have to pay for WinRar after 2 decades. Sad days ahead of us.
"Ok guys, we realized the war on drugs was dumb, but we need wars. How about a war on open source?"
Anyone read about those old coal mining towns in the US?  You work for the mining company, live in company housing (owing rent to the company) and buy food from the company stores.  The cost of living is purposely set to above the wages they pay so their workers are always in debt and can never leave.

That, to me, is a good example of some the problems unregulated capitalism can cause.  Now there's a lot to love about capitalism, but it does have it's share of [problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIuaW9YWqEU).  Traditionally, the only thing that can reliably mitigate the downsides is government regulations.  I don't think many people would say that workers rights and food/environmental safety laws are a bad thing, yet it's in capitalist's interest to not have those things, as generally they cost them money.  That's what's so dangerous about the TTP.  It would take away a significant chunk of a governments ability to regulate corporations.

If you're interested, Dan Carlin, who does a pretty good political podcast IMHO, did a good [podcast](http://hwcdn.libsyn.com/p/6/6/8/66894a63e02388fe/cswdcc90.mp3?c_id=8658015&amp;expiration=1447273817&amp;hwt=edfb0759164181bd7b03a927427063db) on this and more.

#TPP ≠ not just internet, its a massive trade deal.

**long post, because why not, and copy of my old comment**

A few highlights of the TPP: 1. Lower tariffs generally (good for consumers and export-oriented producers, bad for industries that compete heavily with imports)

Signatories agree to enforce intellectual property restrictions for a longer period of time (good for pharmaceutical industry, bad for consumers of generic drugs.

Internet freedom activists have also criticized the TPP for its potential to entrench and expand US copyright law)

It weakens protectionism in the auto industry, like the North American content rules (bad for US auto industry, good for Japan).

It enhances labor mobility so it is easier to move within TPP countries - similar to EU.

It includes labor rights clauses, restricting child labor, forced labor, etc. (this will prevent people from challenging labor laws as protectionist measures, and may raise the standards of some developing country signatories slightly)

Ends some forms of agricultural protectionism in Japan and Canada (bad for Canadian dairy farmers and some Japanese farmers, good for consumers and producers elsewhere).

It also contains an environmental chapter, which has received more criticism than the labor rights chapter as far as I've seen.

It will establish an investor-state dispute mechanism (some critics argue this will elevate corporations and enable them to undermine national sovereignty, while defenders point out that most trade agreements have such provisions, and the TPP has included an opt-out for tobacco regulations, after the Australian experience).

The TPP will likely boost GDP among the 12 prospective signatories (US, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Chile, Australia and New Zealand). But the gains range widely. Because the US is already a large diversified economy, its projected gains from trade are smaller - only about $78 billion. Vietnam, in contrast, is projected to see an 11% boost to GDP.

Of course, not everybody stands to gain equally. Consumers gain pretty unambiguously from having a greater access to cheaper goods.

Workers in some industries stand to lose as they face greater competition abroad, while others stand to gain from access to new markets.

In some countries, however, there are provisions in place to help those displaced by trade treaties. The US has Trade Adjustment Assistance, for instance.And in the Canadian election, Stephen Harper pledged billions to the auto and dairy industry (though it is up to Trudeau as to whether he follows through).

Some of the other implications of the treaty are harder to sort out in a balance sheet type manner. 

There may be geopolitical implications, as the US strengthens trade ties with many ASEAN countries, plus Japan. The treaty may pose risks to the environment. 

And certainly for consumers of generic drugs, this is probably not a good treaty.
Interested in how companies are suing governments worldwide? A corporate enslavement of nations is about to take place. Some following cases of hundreds of cases brought against states by corporations claiming a horde of damages


• Britain is considering plain packaging of cigarette products and it has been challenged by the cigarette industry for compensation that may run into billions of taxpayer money; 

• Philip Morris is suing Uruguay for billions over its decision to increase the size of health warnings on cigarettes and for clamping down on the use of sub-brands, which give the impression that cigarettes are safe to smoke; 

• Philip Morris closed its factory in Uruguay during a labor dispute leaving workers out of jobs by using blackmailing tactics to get its way; 

• Vattenfall the Swedish energy giant filed suit in 2009 for 1.4bn-euros against the Federal Republic of Germany in the Moorburg case that refers to two massive coal chimneys spewing a steady stream of thick smoke into the sky.

 • A year after the Moorburg case closed, Vattenfall files another case against Germany seeking 4.7bn from the taxpayer on its decision to phase out nuclear power. 

• El Salvador is facing a multimillion-dollar suit lodged by a multinational mining company after the small country refused to allow it to dig for gold. 

• Argentina was sued by the French conglomerate Vivendi after the province of Tucuman limited the price it charged people for water and wastewater services and was forced to pay 100m-dollars in compensation. 

• Ecuador after cancelling an oil-exploration contract with Occidental Petroleum the company filed a suit before an international investment tribunal and was awarded 1.8bn-dollars in damages;

 • Australia is currently facing a billion-dollar lawsuit filed by Philip Morris the tobacco conglomerate

I wish there were more literal examples from the TPP, instead of relaying these expert reactions.
If things are done in secrecy, then your best interests are not in mind.  US government is full of crooks equally as bad and corrupt as other foreign governments.  US is no different.
oh well fuck the internet, fun while it lasted, back to actual social interaction
[deleted]
I used a reptile cage scrubber on my fish tank. It was $2 cheaper. They are the same identical piece of sponge tipped plastic. Under the TPP I can apparently get sued for not using a product "correctly."

What's next?

YOU AREN'T THINKING CORRECTLY! TO THE GULAG! OFF WITH 'IS 'EAD!
We all complain about TPP, but still don't hold Obama accountable....and we about about to elect (don't worry it is all rigged) Hillary who is also in the pocket of Hollywood.
Contaminated water, adulterated food, low wages, infringements on free speech and democratic rights. What did you expect? This is capitalism at its finest. Now go out and buy yet another smart phone!
Can anyone give me a high-level summary of this. I keep reading headlines like this and various details of the TPP, but no actual consequences as to why this is bad for me in the UK.
Torrents get killed, and proxies live on.
Internet gets killed and tor lives on.

I wonder where does this end? You can't censor all the information in the world.
1. I despise being grouped in with "the internet"  and the whole idea that the people who compose the internet in any way have the same ideas and thoughts and opinions

2. For all the complaining about the TPP being secret, now it's all out in the open. If you don't want it to pass, talk to your representatives. Congress still has to pass it. We're not past any point of no return. 
And it will pass because the money wants it passed. Until the money is dealt with and then it won't matter any more.
&gt;Another provision of the TPP, designed to protect the interests of software developers prevents nations from demanding source code.

&gt;In theory, this would help prevent piracy and protect the rights of those developers. But it also means that if the source code is secret, there are far fewer eyes searching for potential flaws—a key part of good cybersecurity—increasing the likelihood that the digital products we use can be hacked and our data exploited.



Is the article advocating that we need a regulating body to force developers to provide their source code for open consumption to the public? The open source movement is fantastic but I don't think it should be *forced* upon developers.
Born in a time of Internet pioneering, it's eventually going to slowly and eventually be censored by the government of the places we live in. We're just sheep to the government. They don't care about us. They are fighting over simple things with "political parties" you wouldn't need these if we'd just do the right thing, to benefit the people of today and the future. Morales matter, but choices do too. They're trying to take away our choices and force us into the pins of false security. Corruption at this rate will turn countries such as the United States of America communist, it was a land based on freedom that's now blinded by material objects and personal gain. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump aren't there for you, Trumps is a classic business man, there for his own gain. Hillary has a mask on, you can tell if you pay enough attention. Not of physical material, but of mental. She fakes everything look at her smile. There is no emotion. They will add on to the corruption. They are against the American people for they only think of themselves.
really hoping the last line would be "and its not as bad as everyone feared"
No deal birthed behind closed doors is a good one.
&gt; The DMCA criminalizes DRM circumvention

Kill it with fire, now.
Can we he get an eli5?
Its too bad we are all too busy posting complaints on the internet to let our representatives know that voting for this is going to cost them.

Tweet/call/write your representatives. Let them know this isnt OK.

Some of us Americans are tired of having the best politicians money can buy.
As a side note (Net Neutrality people) this is why it is always good to have the text of a bill or agreement available before it is signed or implemented.

Assuming the TTIP is the same, what does this mean for someone living in the UK?
Thanks Obama. 
Does the TPP criminalize removal of mattress tags too?
If Donald Trump hates the TPP, then I hate the TPP.

China can't keep *beating* us. I want to *win*. ***Let's make America great again.***
&gt; [...] And they say it’s as bad as they feared. 

Written in other ways:

* *Treaty No worse than feared*
* *Treaty meets intellectual property experts' expectations*
* *Experts finally given access to proposed treaty*
* *Secretive TPP now fully available*

;-)
WELP. time to migrate to the deep web.
The fucked up part is that IP rights were the primary focus of the United States. Every potential signatory country prioritized the things it wanted in the TPP. That's how trade deals work. Instead of agriculture tariffs, currency manipulation, renewable energy, cyber security or any number of issues, the US pushed most strongly for fucking copyright laws. If Disney had any shame, they would make a series of cartoons with Mickey Mouse living homeless in a smog filled city full of overpriced, unexportable goods.
What can we do to stop this?
Thanks Obama. 
the real purpose of the tpp is to control the future of information technologies. towards which all industries are tending. to constrict a future where access to accelerating tech in manufacturing, synthetic biology/genetics, distributed computing, AI, blockchain etc. is democratized. encouraging privatization and exporting of US patent laws ensures all future advancements/innovations can be controlled. those breaking the law will be criminalized and subject to the draconian US penal system. and don't be surprised if modifying YOUR dna will be considered an act of bio-terrorism.
Last week European Parliament passed the TTIP bill, so we're actually half fucked up. Now single European nation will have to ratificate the shit, bringing it legal to censure an manipulate the internet at their pleasure. It's believed that for the end of 2016 we should get the first practical signs of that, such as ISP offering low budget data packs that will allow you just to a certain speed, maybe just heavily limitating the speed when you get out the "safe zone". They just need to keep it cheap in the first place, many will migrate without even thinking...anyway what's the problem if I'll be able to get news only from CNN or Fox... ! 
Abuse of intellectual property is a major factor in trade: perhaps half of all aeroplane engine parts in Asia are fakes. In China in 2002, one US brand had a 95% market share, but the owners of the brand sold only 5% of the total product that was consumed: the rest was counterfeit. When Microsoft launched Windows XP in Hong Kong, there were vendors selling ripped-off CDs of it outside the very conference centre where they did the launch. 

The treaty is designed to manage this sort of abuse abuse of intellectual property. That is why it is written explicitly to manage the abuse of intellectual property. Those who are innately opposed to patents, copyright protection and similar IP management will oppose any such measures, be they in the TPP or out of it. Secrecy has nothing to do with it: if those stealing IP were outed, you can be quite sure that there would be a hullabaloo about privacy. Transparency is always for other people. 
&gt;devastating for internet freedom

Just about everything in TPP is a copy pasta of what was already in placed in the US.. 
By this time we should be shooting nukes and flinging feces at whoever will not leave our internet alone... the fact that we havent had any random acts of violence against these fuckwads is the reason they keep resurrecting this shit. Please go out there and burn their fucking houses down instead of politely discussing this horseshit!


The US copyright system of forever and a day is ridiculous B.S.
It's crazy how many people hold such powerful opinions about this deal when it's such an insanely complicated deal. Maybe some parts of this deal seem negative when they're neatly summarized in a possibly biased paragraph, but when was the last time you agreed with every part of a document that was thousands of pages long?


[deleted]
I hope it's not the same kind of intellectual property "experts" that helped write it.
The real problems associated with the TPP are not internet related. They relate to corporate power vis-a-vis government. Almost nobody on this thread is fighting corporate control over water, food, money, land and people. Most people here just want free things on the internet. If you do, then you can fuck off. I don't care that you risk prosecution if you download free  movies or music. Your first world problems are laughable. 

TPP was done in total secrecy hidden from the public, so it must be great for everyone.
[deleted]
haha coming from r/economics to this place is great.

the sky is falling hysteria is fun the watch
&gt;“all of the provisions that recognize the rights of the public are non-binding, whereas almost everything that benefits rightsholders is binding.”

Isn't that always the way it goes? Sigh
Remember kids, your politicians are terrorists and deserve to be treated as such. 
How does anyone? even the most entrenched experts, know anything about the TPP, it's over 5500 pages, and over thirty chapters, of corporatist junk.

Wouldn't it be cheaper as a society to just pay our congressmen like 10 million a year or something extravagant so they wouldn't be as apt to be bought out by special interests?  I mean can we the people just bribe them to do what is best for us?  It would save billions in the long run.
I don't understand how it is constitutional to keep it secret until after it's passed. That is diabolical.

Copyright in Canada is LIFE plus fifty years, not fifty years and it's being extended to LIFE plus seventy years.

You can only share stuff created between 1945 and 1965 if the creator died before 1965.

Can we not have one single article on this topic that isn't completely crap? I realize daily dot just plagiarized the EFF article which was also craps, but still.
They cannot enforce it everywhere. Their stupid idea is stillborn.
Hope it doesn't get buried but Carl Sagan warned us about this sort of thing decades ago 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iyFw8UF85A
Whoever wrote this article does not know what they are on about, given they say:

&gt;  It can be quite easy to be falsely accused of piracy, and in the past, major copyright holders have had no problems with suing regular users for hundreds of millions of dollars over claims of copyright infringement. And remember, these claims can go to the ISDS.

The ISDS provisions *do not* apply to claims by copyright holders against alleged infringers.  I mean, seriously, it's in the name: ISDS is *investor-state* dispute settlement.  It applies to claims by investors against states in connection with alleged breaches of the guarantees provided for by the investment chapter of the TPP by the state in question.  That simply has zero application to a claim against Jimmy for downloading Game of Thrones.
well its not worse than they feared so all is well nd overhyped
O wow this article is full of it. Here is there claim when it comes to Tobacco companies suing countries:

&gt;U.S.-based cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris sued, unsuccessfully, over that law, citing a different trade agreement. The TPP’s legal system, the EFF argues, “can be characterized as a tool for private industry to directly undermine democracy and any public interest rule.”

The TPP *explicitly removes Tobacco companies from this sort of activity*. Its like Reddit just has no idea how trade deals work and why they benefit a lot of small as well as large US companies. [Here](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/11/06/455055023/episode-662-omg-tpp) is a great NPR: Planet Money podcast for all the uninformed out there. Please stop spreading lies, this deal is not evil. 
ITT: Edgy teens who don't understand economics, lawmaking, or geopolitics.
ITT: People who don't really know what's in the TPP. I'm going to leave [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/3ru5y6/transpacific_partnership_open_thread/) right here.
The internet sucks now already with the the county blocking,  and being in Canada it's gonna suck even more than it already does.   When governments and corporations tag team the citizens,  it's may as well not even exist.
I would like to know who wrote the TPP, every chapter and verse of this over 5,000 page document. My guess is that it was written by lobbyists and lawyers, and who were these lobbyists and lawyers working for? Who wants to take credit for writing it? Who wants to keep who wrote it secret? Those are some questions that I did not hear being asked as this massive trade agreement was pushed by President Obama to be fast-tracked by Congressmen and Congresswoman who had to go to secret meetings to read even one page of the agreement, and they were not permitted to take notes from what they read. How can Congress know if the TPP deal is in the best interests of their constituents if they have to jump through hoops to even read one page? This is not democracy. This is crony capitalism in its most extreme form. 
Can anyone cite for me the parts of the TPP that they so vehemently object to? Everything I've read in it has seemed quite good (particularly on labor).
What countries will this TPP trade deal directly affect? If not all of them at least indirectly.
The dystopian future is calling. Prepare to bend over to our  Umbrella/Vault-Tec inc. overlords.
it is horrible to American autonomy and jobs. Worse than the dems first attempt, nafta and Gatt..and there is also another one proposed by this administration on the Atlantic side called TISA, which is JUST as bad as TTP..this admin is selling out America
Can we say "the people" instead of "the internet"? That'd be great. Thanks. For those of you that are confused, the internet is not a being of anykind. 
tl;dr he is whining about the possibility of not being able to watch anime and to read manga for freeh en la futura.
More people should learn about resource based economies. Capitalism has taken us a few paces forwards but it wont take us all the way to better equity for everyone, the systems inherent flaw is the socio-economic incentives that produce behaviour counter-productive to sustainable existence. These attacks should be a wake up call.
Who in the US government is responsible for this?

What human sack of shit would hide this from the public?


Holy Shit. Like is there anything we can do about this? As democratic citizens?
You know, every year or so there is a story that hits the front of all about a struggling unknown artist who has had her work stolen by some big corporation. They post to reddit and the hivemind marches down to the local pitchfork emporium and riots until the situation is resolved and the artists work is taken down.

Now imagine a big corporation came to reddit, hat in hand, and complained that there were people stealing (downloading) their content without paying.

Can you fucking imagine, reddit would tell them to get fucked and laugh in their face.

But how is it different.

All I see in this thread are thieves complaining that they might get punished for stealing.
I'm just going to not infringe on copyrights to make my life easier. 
The internet has thoughts as a singular entity? Wow, I didn't know we created AI.
If the critics were blatantly wrong about TPP being secret (https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text ), can you really trust their criticism?
If that is the worst that the TPP is, that isn't bad at all. It is a trade deal, some wins, some losses. You just hope that the wins are more than the losses, and that is what is happening here. I'm not sure at all why people are upset about fast track or that it was done in secrecy. First off, of course it is done in secret, all negotiations of any kind are from the NFL CBA to large trade deals. You only leak the awful stuff to get a better bargaining position, and of course negotiations start absurd, that is the point. As far as fast track, that is the only way ANYTHING gets done. If each country could change things, it would never be implemented. What about a climate treaty where the US only accepts the provisions where other countries need to cut down? What about a strategic missile reduction treaty where the USSR only accepts the provisions where the US has to cut down? The Iran nuclear deal would be useless if the Iranians only agreed to the parts about discontinuing the embargo and nothing on the nuclear reductions or inspections. 

It just seems like a fuss about nothing.
well if they can't get it passed in office may has well backdoor it on something people are gonna hate already anyway.
Depending on how bad this gets I'll simply unplug from the internet and get damn good at Age of Mythology while listening to old David Bowie CDs.
The good news is the current administration is ending in a year, the bad news is that if people don't start voting we'll have 8 more. 
Does anyone want to explain what the TPP is doing? I've been reading this and I don't really understand it.
A law that can't be applied is not a law. It's just a bunch of people wasting time and money on useless pieces of paper.
I thought that it was talking about Twitch Plays Pokemon before I clicked the link...
Largest problem for Australian's is that we get a fuck you australia tax applied to everything literally and these laws in the tpp prevent australians from legally accessing other markets because of current anti competitive behaviours by foriegn owned and operated companies since with the old excuse of region zoning. This is literally tyranous American companies trying to prevent Australian's from being able to shop around a better price and calling that literally copyright infringement. Imagine if you wanted to skip around a price but stone bullshit trade agreement carrot your idiot and potentially corupt leadership wouldn't resist to enforce foriegn profit margins. It's not like those same producers weren't making money, but instead they can artificially inflate the price above every market and not pay tax on that either because Fuck you that's why.
In reading this, I loved how it was all a sign of our times, along with a link to "how to survive a mass shooting" shoe-horned in there too.

Society is fucked.
What I'd really like to know is what I can do to effect change.  Call my senators? Done.

Now what?
Can anyone say how it will affect someone in the UK?
Man, this thing is a nightmare

So if I read the last part correctly, the TPP hasn't become official law in the U.S.?
You have lots of power over this if you really don't like it: Stop buying this stuff.
What if I don't live in one of those 12 countries? 
Please somebody make a tor Android app so the peoples internet can move there. 
This is the part when you realize that this fix has been in for years and everyone helped them take away the last bit of freedom we had left.
I felt like I fell into a click bait trap once again about TPP.
The hydra bay welcomes all comers.
So if just about everyone hates this why is it a thing? 
It will be like the world of Cyberpunk, Gibson chose correctly.
Funny how it's always the biggest criminals and psychopaths who worry about any new state sanction. All while having the nerve to hide behind "mu'h freedoms". Where the hell was our freedom when some FELON was banning us from subreddits or even shit we paid for on Steam or whatever?

Where was our freedoms when those guys were discriminating akin to when they used to have "no niggers" signs, and libeling, harassing, assaulting our person? What? Suddenly freedom is just fictional conveniently then? Freedom ONLY exists when it can oh so conveniently hurt the government and thereby hurt efficiency and providing actual positive benefits to a populace?

Anyone who opposes the TPP is either a fool or a moderator trying to dupe you all into continually supporting their own criminal behavior. You know why Reddit, 4chan, etc all hate TPP? Because they won't get to continue making money banning and shitting on you. Their modernized economy fueled by fraud, embezzlement, and tax-evasion will be made obsolete. Which is still a better fate than they deserve which is tortured in some dank dark foreign prison.
good job obama.
What does The Google think about the TPP deal?
What we needs is, is a kickstarter like fund to pay for some hot shot lawyers to handle a monster legal fight, some crazy lobbyists to ~~bribe~~ persuade government officials that TPP is a really bad idea which will loose them votes. While that's all happening we hire some meme-master grade marketing bods to produce a slick advertising campaign and run it continuously on nation TV and radio.

Are there any girls on the internet? Maybe we can find one that wants to be the face of this campaign.

OK so I'm being facetious, but fact is the only way to fight this shit is with big money and huge publicity! I would happily start it if I thought I had the personality to carry it off!

After seeing the final draft of the TPP, well, I can confirm i don't have PopcornTime and utorrent clients anywhere near my computers.

You either allow intellectual property or you don't. There's no middle ground here.  It's NOT necessary. Open source stuff proves it.  But the "copying is theft" and "if they don't get a monopoly people won't create things" arguments are just too appealing to idiots, even though they're so blatantly false and disproved thousands of times over in recent history alone.
Can someone eli5 TPP?
Freedom of speech it is a thing of the past.
How does the president say that this is good for any of us? Or those in Congress who are for this? I just feel so let down by this system, all of us are being drown out by both the government and large corporations,  and the revolving path between the two.

Since congress voted against it, I would like Reddit to tell me who is (or at least who is most) responsible for TPP.
I'm not really surprised, but I'm really starting to get serious and pragmatic about how to defeat the TPP.

Basically, Congresspeople will vote for it and nothing will stop it as long as the issue is confusing or only "a little controversial" to their bases.  I'm not even sure how much it's worth the fight in the House of Representatives.  It's the Senate where there's an actual game to play, though.  While Democratic senators might get in a twist if scads of young voters pester them about it, their nays will be but tokens if Republican senators are not pushed the same way--but they don't care too much about the young vote.

*We have to magnify the relevance of TPP issues that will upset the moms and pops,* and we have to make sure it reaches the media channels they see.  Skyrocketing drug costs are one issue to use, for example.  *But how could we reach them on the topic of the internet freedom impact?*

That's a weird name for a drug.

It wouldn't let me use the link to the original article when I was trying to make the submission so here is original CBC [Link](http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/infantile-seizures-drug-1.3318183)
I mean, according to the article it was either raise the price or cease production altogether. This drug is still available.
Did anyone bother reading the article? It stated that production of the drug was to stop entirely in 2016. 

Are we just ignoring facts now and just grabbing pitchforks for the sake of being outraged?
Holy fucking misinformed reddit.
Not many people outside of pharma would know this, but they also did this with IV acetaminophen. When Mallinckrodt bought the patent from Cadence, they increased the price 140%. It put a significant strain on my hospital's finances. We used to use it like water post op, but after the price increase we put heavy restrictions on its use. 

[Mallinckrodt buys IV acetaminophen from Cadence](http://drugtopics.modernmedicine.com/drug-topics/news/when-iv-acetaminophen-costs-skyrocketed-one-health-system-did-some-new-math?page=full)
The rise of CBD medicines should take advantage of this.
Don't even bother reading these comments it's pure stupidity.
Can't wait for an offbrand company to make a $1.00 Vial
I want to share with everyone how dangerous infantile spasms can be. My son was diagnosed with a rare brain disorder at 3 months old, and we were told to expect seizures and look out for them. Only a few weeks later he started having these jerks randomly. At first they were only a split second at random and it was difficult to catch on camera. Then they started more frequently. They only lasted a few seconds, came in clusters from just a few to over a hundred in about 15 minutes. He was diagnosed with infantile spasms. He was no longer trying to sit up, became paralyzed on the entire left side of his body and did not use it anymore. These seizures caused global development delay and it was hell. We had the option of ACTH injections which was estimated to be around 40k (before insurance) and another medication called Sabril which had very bad side effects I wasn't willing to risk. By some miracle the seizure medication we started him on stopped the IS within a few weeks, it wasn't supposed to. 

Taking advantage of parents and children like this is absolutely Fucking revolting. 
This is why the government has to decide the pricing on medicine. I mean, a free market is great and all, but in cases like this it's just too dangerous.

Edit: Yes, I'm no expert at economics. My points was that the prices of things like these, should be regulated by the government. 
On one hand we want to incentivize companies to make these drugs.  On the other we don't like the price gouging they engage in.

Its a very complex issue and not nearly as black and white as many of the highly upvoted comments would have us think.

The reality is that nobody makes these drugs out of the goodness of their heart.  If not for the profit motive, these drugs wouldn't exist and that seems like the worst possible outcome.

Of course some of these price gouging activities are being conducted by companies that didn't even create the drugs, so maybe we have pushed the profit motive too far.

I think we are close to a happy medium and probably need to look at a tweak in the regulations, not a massive overhaul.

The *funny* thing is, a whole lot of research money comes from the government (31 billion from the National Institutes of Health in the US alone). Then, all these trained up, knowledgeable people and know-how are used for creating marked-up drugs. This is insane, the average consumer is paying twice for their medicine - once in taxes to fund it, and once to a shill of a capitalist to mass produce it.

Why would any company name a drug 'Absurd?' Poor marketing strategy
/s
Get em reddit. 
Weird for a drug for children to be named "Absurd".
No guys this is just the invisible hand of the free market working in its mysterious ways. It should NOT be questioned.

It should be illegal to patent a drug. Go ahead and patent your method of creating the drug, but patenting the drug itself, ensuring that no one can buy it for anything lower than your absurd prices, should be considered a crime. These companies are profiting off people's desperation to treat their health problem, it's equivalent to war profiteering. 
Anyone else here think that the seizure drug was named absurd?
Before people start bashing on capitalism, think about why these price increases are happening.

The ONLY reason these price hikes are possible is because of Patents or Intellectual Property rights on things such as this which are enforced by governments, stop competition which then leads to high prices. 

There is no free market (capitalism) in health care if you have artificially high barriers to entry / laws which prevent people from competing, leading to monopolies.

Why do we keep tackling these issues one by one so nothing gets done? Isn't it about time we attack the corrupt source?
I knew Mallinckrodt sounded so familiar. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallinckrodt#Nuclear_Waste_in_St._Louis.2C_Missouri
"Mallinckrodt says it increased the price because of a change of manufacturing." -- how about you change it back?
Here we go again.
We used a similar treatment for our son who has a genetic disorder. The injection we used retailed at $150,000 per small vial.

Unreal
First...
&gt; The drug is long off patent. Snead said it works 90 per cent of the time.

Then...

&gt;"They just bought it and jacked up the price," Snead said...   
The global pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt owns the rights to Synacthen Depot in Canada.

Wait, so if it's off-patent then how can someone buy the rights to it? Can someone, possibly from Canada, explain this to me?
Is it enough yet? Is this what finally outrages enough to change things or must there be more?
'absurd' is a terrible name for a drug.
Maybe because they know marijuana stops seizures in children and infants
Two words, Charlotte's Web.
ACTH is a similar drug to the one mentioned in the article, which is used for treating Wests Syndrome in the US. It costs, ehem, right around $20,000 a vial.

Hopefully in a month there will be a generic brand do that costs 1$
US drug prices have soared astronomically the past five years and much as there are this that want to blame capitalism, the reality is that prices are allowed to be increased as we have seen as a result of laws enacted in the guise of making a "Cheaper and More Inclusive" health provision. 
And here it comes; the copy-cat PharmaBros looking to make a quick buck at others' pain. More will come in the near future, unfortunately. It is time to stop looking at healthcare as a for-profit venture or we'll **never** be free of sick fucks who kill people to line their pockets and then take Ambien to sleep at night.
Unless, I'm missing something doesn't it actually make sense that they hiked the price?

&gt;infants in Canada with a rare and potentially dangerous form of epilepsy

If the consumer base for said specific drug is too small then they have to increase the price in order to even break even after all the costs incurred for developing the drug.

Otherwise there would just be no drug for sale at all.

Like didn't the other drug that got a massive price spike only have like 2000 users? There was no way they could have ever broke even without a price increase.
Who would name an anti seizure medication"absurd"? Doesn't seem like a good marketing strategy 

Why are we doing this to people? Why is this okay? Is this all just in the name of capitalism or are they just passing the cost down to consumers? I don't understand why greed is allowed to literally hand people a death sentence. 
What scuzzbags. Just evil.
I have a question. Doesn't the government have price gouging laws? Why don't those apply? 
yet the out of pocket cost is a fraction of that but who wants to bring common sense in to the argument.
That's absurd 
This is absurd. 
I wonder if Charlotte's Web would work for these babies?
If only we had anti seizure medications that were natural, organic, and grown everywhere like a plant, a weed if you will..
I'm confused, I thought healthcare in Canada is perfect?

Redditors, somebody help me out here?
skreli strikes again?
A company can do whatever the hell it wants until you regulate it. Which is to say, if you don't like the fact that this price jump happened, support the regulation of pharmaceutical monopolies and/or intellectual property rights as they apply to pharmaceuticals.
You can't praise capitalism for all its strengths then panic when shit like this happens. This is what you get 
Why can't a bunch of people find these assholes, confront them and say "knock it off, knucklehead, or we're going to kill you."

If you can't act with decency in a free market, you lose the privilege. 
Just so every one knows.  It's a [peptide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetracosactide).  It's a synthetic peptide and analogue of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) which is used clinically as a diagnostic agent. It consists of the first 24 (of a total of 39) amino acids of ACTH and retains full function of the parent peptide. Large scale synthesis of a 100 kg per year, the costwould approximately be US $7.5–10 per gram per amino acid. residue
As someone that sees blueprints from Europe all day long it took me a second to realize it was not a 2.000% hike.  
It's off patent.  Another drug company will come in and make it for cheap just like last time.  
It really comes down to the laws and regulations put into place. It's not surprising that every time a company fucks us, it's in an industry where competition is small, and it's very hard to compete against ridiculous hikes. All corporations may be greedy, but the laws protecting the few from competition allow they to be almost unlimitedly greedy without repercussion.
Quit having seizure babies
This bullshit in a nutshell: Its been happening for a while, scapegoat one hateable guy. Assume problem is fixed, find a new target. Nothing about the industry changed, and it will happen again regardless because once its legal to do, it will happen for profit.

Whenever this happen, the company that makes the drug should be nationalized. 
Welcome to capitalism, enjoy your stay.
Capitalism is great though.
Capitalism doing god's work
Still think unfettered capitalism is a good idea?

I'm sorry you, my neighbors to the north, are suffering under the same ludicrous system.

Capitalism is undoubtedly broken and continues to be proven even more so every day.  We need to dismantle wall street and the public option.
Capitalism strikes again.
That's a weird name for a seizure drug.
Good thing you have socialized healthcare. Just spread that cost around to the taxpayers and let the pharm companies make billions.
They also bought the rights to ofirmev. Orrrrr injectable Tylenol and raised the price substantially too. Seriously. We are pulling this shit with Tylenol now. Wtf
Just goes to show you what type of greedy people we are dealing with.

I would love to see the stats on how many people died from not being able to afford overpriced meds
Welcome to ineslastic demand, when a company increases profits by raising prices than it does by lowering them. After all, are you going to stop buying that medication and let your new baby have a seizure? 

Other than a regulatory solution, the best option to change this behavior is a consumer boycott of anything the company sells. The market has to make the act of a massive price hike so unpopular, that the company factors in the risk of public perception. 

That, or the patent expires. 
This would never happen in a country like... Huh... Weird.
I thought the medicine it self was called absurd. Then though, nah, that's bogus.
I'm epileptic, was only diagnosed with it a couple years ago when I was 16. This is fucking disgusting, it's horrible dealing with seizures as a teenager/young adult, I can't imagine seeing a small child/baby going through it just because the meds are too expensive. 
Are we surprised that drug companies are run by some of the greediest sick shitheads in the corporate world? 
Not this fucking shit again....
It's a good thing cannabis is much cheaper!

So now you Canadians can see what we here in the USA go through every day. First time I've seen the price differential go that way. How much is Albenza in Canada? $2.37 a tablet last I checked. Here it's $161.02, in a bottle labeled "Made in Canada".

Come get your cosyntropin here in the USA, it's "only" $80 a vial wholesale (but you gotta buy a box of ten).
But hey, regulation is socialism and unamerican.

This is why we have rules, and government intervention, because when your unabashed greed isn't even softened by an infant in need, you need to be watched. 
"Absurd" doesn't seem like a strong enough superlative. 

Evil is probably a better choice.
Its all about the money. Who cares if children die? /s
Preying on the most vulnerable of people who have no alternative but to pour out life-savings to treat their sick child. These monsters are amongst the lowest of the lows of humanity.
You just got **TPP**'d!
Stories like this make me really want to nationalize the whole healthcare system.
"Pitchforks for sale! Get your USDA Grade A, pitchforks here today folks!"



-------E -------E -------E -------E 



Now with kevlar shaft and reinforced grips! 
Unfortunately, I believe Mallinckrodt completely. For a rarely used drug with very low demand, any change in the manufacturing process would result in a significant increase in price. Every time the FDA makes a regulation change, it adds millions to the cost of the manufacturing process, which is usually only negated through mass production.
There need to be a limit for capitalism. This should be considered profiteering and needing some jail time.
I'm curious how much is in a vial. It there's 680 doses per, that's one dollar per dose. On the other hand maybe it's only one dose. I really have no idea, but everyone's getting out the pitchforks based on a Yahoo article about a drug they've never heard of and it provides absolutely no context. From what I can tell, they dose 1ml per day for a few days. So if there's 30ml in a vial, it would probably cost about $200 for treatment. That's really good as long as it isn't needed regularly. OR maybe the vials are 1ml a piece and it's going to cost $20,000 a month, I really can't tell. 
This is a good thing, it will encourage others into the market. We wanted capitalism right?
As someone who suffers from seizures, and is about to have a baby next month, the possibility of her having them is there. And now this?

What the fuck is wrong with people?
I just want to express my relief that America didn't adopt death panels and just let the private sector price people out of their mortality. 

Free markets, man. 
THC pills are very effective in stopping seizures LEGALIZE IT M8
Put a price on a pill whose demand is pretty much guaranteed for anyone inflicted with this disease, and worse, the price is maintained by private individuals, are we going to accept that this isn't working soon or are we going to continue shouting "bad apples"?
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?

Why are there so many pathetic sacks of shit in the world? 
A drug that saves the newborns and infants from debilitating life threatening illness and people label this price hiking shit as "Absurd"...a better word for it is "Evil"
Who names a drug absurd 
If I found 50 million dollars in a suitcase, I would keep it. No question about it, that money would be mine. But if I found a suitcase full of this medicine and I knew I could easily get 50 million for it, I couldn't do it. I'd give it away to people who need it. And I'm poor as shit. No excuse for this. 
Once again, greed over the betterment of mankind!!!
The TPP will have clauses defending these pharmaceutical companies too.. Come on Trudeau..
Capitalism am i right
Who names an infant seizure drug "Absurd"?
Hedge Funds are the real terrorists.
It's the Yahoo news icon that caught my attention in this post more than the headline.

But, yeah that's totally fucked.
Wait till you hear about the medication Sabril.
This is the unfortunate side effect of a free market on medications. Medications such as these are used quite rarely and the companies often lose money on them. So they increase the price. They're for profit drug companies. It's what they do. And since it's so rarely used other companies aren't fighting to make the same drug since they won't make any money either.

The upside is that by having profit as an incentive, these companies have the desire to keep making life saving drugs. If they weren't going to make money they wouldn't gamble the millions of dollars in research and development.
As long as there is no real consequence for bad behavior, this and everything else wrong in the corporate world will only continue. If these companies got a swift response like a new puppy shitting on your carpet, then perhaps they'd learn...
If these people wanted to not get so much outrage they could do the same thing and only raise the drug's price 25% to even 100% and we wouldn't hear about, but these greedy fucks know the patients have no choice and are laughing all the way to the bank.

These companies have blood on their hands.
Well you wouldn't want anything bad to happen to your baby right 
This is getting old.
This saddens my heart. I have an infant with a benign tumor who is taking propanalol (which was traditionally used for treating hypertension in adults). I can imagine that at some point in the near future, the same thing will happen to this drug. In fact, I don't think any critical drug is off the table.
But guys,  it's just capitalism. You would do the same thing if you were in that position. ^^/s
Maybe I'm ignorant but since this is a drug prescribed in Canada (according to the article), wouldn't Canada's national healthcare take care of the cost?
I like money just like the next person but come on. 
Very poorly written headline. It's worded as if the name of the drug is Absurd. 
My question is how do these people explain in to their friends and colleagues? When they go out for their fancy lunches and discuss business how do they say "well make so much money fucking these people over" 
Isn't capitalism great!
Isn't Universal Healthcare and it's collective bargaining was supposed to stop this?
Those dimwits who wrote the article need to know that is **percent** and not **per cent**!
what about medical marijuana for the infants? I have seen stories that absolutely back up the use of medical marijuana in medicine form to cease seizures, it's natural and doesn't seem to have the negative effects of big pharma drugs.
We need to start jailing the people who do this for crimes against humanity. 
I thought they called the drug "absurd". Then i looked if it was subredditsimulator, and then i finally realized im stupid.
A drug called absurd, eh?
Sometimes government over regulates because fuck you we're in charge.

Sometimes government over regulates because industry makes such a total asshole of themselves, they are practically begging for it.
When are these fucking people going to be held accountable for this kind of deplorable business conduct.  Are there any regulatory committees or bodies that don't have their hands in the pockets of these companies?  This is insane.
You may even say that's.... ABSURD.
Marijuana probably cures it better than this drug.
Count Dooku must be behind this!
This is why we need to abandon flat corporate tax rates and make them based on margin. 
As if they didn't learn the first time. Reddit did you bring your pitchforks? 
Further evidence that we need a single-payer system
WTF its almost as if they want children to suffer. I guess only the rich matter since they can afford it. 
It's weird to see that medicine gets this inflation while we overlook the prices of other hyper-inflated products and services, I'd almost think we'd need a consumers advocacy panel in congress, but it likely already exists in many fields yet has been gutted to only the most "essential" of trusts, like big oil or diamond trade. 

Could anyone imagine a govt panel that says "ok samsung, Sony,Vizio et-al; your 4KTV are on average 5500$, it costs 250$ in materials to make right now, this looks like price fixing..." 

Now's the time to fix price fixing everywhere, not just solely in the pharma arm of price fixing. 
Gotta spend that cheddar if you want your kid to be better.
This company is not having a good week. I think with all the attention on pharma pricing practices right now, some of these hikes may be reversed. We'll see.

The people who come up with greedy shit like this are far more dangerous to our country than terrorists.

Affordable healthcare is a human right. These people would deny fucking infants their human rights. 
Who would name a drug 'absurd'? That's one weird-ass name.
Can someone please tell me how it is possible for someone to buy the rights to a drug that is long off patent..?
Well, give it a month or so.  This is how we get cheaper drugs, apparently.  Maybe he's doing us all a favor in reverse?
CBD oil
There comes a time in every civilization that its people must stand up and ruthlessly wrench back control from the elitist. Need you guys to start watching platoon or Apocalypse Now everyday, because you guys are soft As Fuck.

We are left with no choice but to eradicate the greedy by any means necessary.

Someone needs to make an example of this and the other guy. I vote castration, all in favor say aye.
Weed is free
So the drug is named "Absurd"?
http://i.imgur.com/bz2E3mH.jpg
Just semantics here, the drug is not actually named 'absurd', rather this was a comment made in reference to the tremendous price hike.
We can't rely on the private sector for morality. Competition within a regulatory framework that prevents this kind of shit is the only way to go. 
Smoka da ganj
honestly I feel like we need end the medical business and make it apart of a government agency. 
they need weed. it helped my sister calm down before passing away
We probably need some kind of regulatory board like the CFPB with the power to investigate and punish companies that are abusing these situations to hold people hostage.
Please tell me again why Socialized Health Care is wrong?
I actually like when I read stuff like this.  It's only a matter of time before Big Pharma is more heavily regulated to stop insane price gouging like this.  Keep on being greedy companies.
Greed is a helluva drug.
I'm glad that these price hikes are being noticed now, maybe it will eventually lead to a reform of policies regarding pharmaceutical companies and patents in the Northern Americas. 
**checks absurd-o-meter**

It checks out.  This is absurd. Screw these people. 
I propose we put every price for vote on Reddit, and only allow it after Reddit users think it is reasonable. /s
So we have a repeat of the greedy bastard and the AIDS drug. Fuck people. 
Yay capitalism! 


/s
Wait is the drug called absurd?
Well guess CBD is a cheaper resource. Maybe we should use that?
If only there was some sort of natural medication that helps people with seizures. They wouldn't arbitrarily make it illegal would they?
ITT: People thinking this is in America
one does everything to attain that murican dream
Check the prices for Doxycycline.  You will be shocked!
This type of thing is what's really wrong with our country.  Not to mention how much influence they have in Washington.
Next week it will be $1. Just wait for the free market to kick in.
My son was diagnosed with infantile spasms and we had to give him ACTH injections which were 5k a shot twice a day. It was almost 60k a vial. He also takes Sabril twice a day which is 5k for a month supply...its crazy what these companies charge for medicine!
medical procedures or related medication should only be expensive, or vary in price if it's not essential or life threatening: ie, getting a nose or boob job.  that is superficial.  on the other hand...life saving surgery?  or medicine that will allow you to function like a regular person?  everyone should have access to that.

there should not be a paywall that determines if you will be living or dying.
[And this is exactly why TPP should not be ratified.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Pacific_Partnership)
I don't quite get why this sort of thing is surprising. When global economic systems encourage and facilitate greed and exploitation, we should expect these kind of things.
Decisions that harm people financially without any concern should only be made by muggers kidnappers and banks. Drug companies should be ashamed of themselves. In all seriousness though...they all suck.

I remember 6 to 7 years ago my little guy had west syndrome.  It's pretty horrible thing for your little one to go through. Little seizures Start to get worse and worse and you feel so helpless.   We went to sick kids too.  We caught it early and the doctors gave two drugs. The first one is supposed too block that part of the brain that causes the seizures and the second is like a steroid to fix other problems.   Worst thing with these drugs is the 16 bottles of milk it will make your kid drink.  I can't look back at early pictures of my son.   Not because he gained sooo much weight.  But I remember him yelling non stop for more food and formula all the time all hours of the night   after the drugs are out of the system they go back to normal weight.  But I'm sure no one has seen a 9 month old chug 16 bottles that fast.  After that they turn into a zombie like state.  No reactions.  No smile.  It took my little guy almost 4 months before he would smile again. Pretty sad time.     Now I remember paying around 50 bucks for these viles back then.  And they were really expensive.   Also we had to inject it into his leg from home.   Thankfully you online need a week or twos worth.  Sorry I can't remember.  But I do remember not costing much for than 500 bucks.  Can't imagine what these poor parents would do now at 600 + a vile. I'm thankful I was start starting a small business and could afford this.. However in the USA at this time parents would have it waaaaaay worse.  Because it was 2500 bucks a vile.  And normally people living in USA would come to Canada and smuggle the drug back.  I was always thankful we never had to pay that 2500 a vile.  With all the brain scans that go along with it these American parents would be in dept upwards around 200k. I understand companies need to make money.  But as a patient.  It rips my heart out thinking of these young poor parents trying to figure out how to afford this drug and go into dept. 
this is such a dumb PR move to do when everyone was recently so focused on that other slimeball that sold his pills for thousands of dollars.
There should be regulation put in place where they have to justify the price hike. Or just have globalized standard Healthcare. 
Beginnning to think this is more about downsizing global population, instead of corporates addiction to infinite growth. 
So sad that these people are in controll of other peoples lives. Well luckily for most CBD has been a huge success with seizures. Hopefully someone can make these people pay somehow.
That's absurd
 And people wonder why we're giving them THC instead.
&gt; infant seizure drug called 'absurd'

is this from some other country and poorly translated? Because why on earth would you name a drug meant to help children absurd? does it stand for absurdkodetinfloiazapamanien or something?

&gt; ca.news.yahoo.com

Oh.
For those too lazy to read the article, since the TLDR bot didn't mention it: there will be exceptions made for those with legitimate medical reasons not to vaccinate.
I feel like although this is obviously great incentive for anti-vaxxers to change their mind but the truly obsessed believers will just forgo the benefits and then we're left with these kids that are just doubly fucked, not only are they more likely to get sick and die now they're poorer to boot. Unlucky little shits. Wheres the middle ground between pushing the parents and protecting the children. 
Why are so many people around the world against vaccination? There must be people on here against it, given how big this problem is, any of you care to share your thoughts as to why you're against if?

edit: War and Peace below me.
I love the way the Victorian Premier responded to the anti-vaxer's protests a few months back.

He basically said "This is science, you can't protest science, guys".

edit: I was paraphrasing. Can't find his exact response, will have to ask him in his AMA tomorrow.
Premier*
Seems a like an effective way to protect the herd.
For me all of the anti-vaxers are coming out of the wood work on Facebook. There are only so many poorly structured anecdotal click bait articles I can take before my head explodes.
Wow, this anti vaccination group is seriously big in the West. Sometimes, I think poor people are much smarter than their rich counterparts. India recently was announced polio free and also managed to eradicate maternal and neonatal Tetanus all thanks to successful vaccination campaigns. It is extremely weird that the more educated people are against vaccines.
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/30171755/no-jab-no-pay-laws-pass-parliament/) reduced by 76%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Parents who don&amp;#039;t immunise their children will stop receiving childcare benefits next year but one senator believes welfare for all parents should be stripped back.

&gt; The federal government&amp;#039;s no-jab-no-pay laws will remove childcare benefits, rebates and the Family Tax Benefit A end-of-year supplement from parents who don&amp;#039;t immunise their children.

&gt; Labor said the Department of Human Services needed to conduct an intensive review of how the scheme was working, with particular focus on the seven per cent of parents who don&amp;#039;t vaccinate their children but are not registered conscientious objectors.

Makes sense. If you're not going to protect your child in one of the most basic ways, why should taxpayers help you support it?
I just wonder how much of the wealthy upper-class are getting their kids vaxed.
Hopefully the US will pass something similar!! 
Why the fuck does this article spend half it's space quoting David Leyonhjelm? He is the *only* member of his party holding any office and only got elected because his name was first on the ballot in a country with mandatory voting, ie a *donkey vote* 

Why did they give him so much space to rant on about his "libertarian" policies which would be far more at home in the US than Australia?

&gt;They get next to no welfare, pay more tax and use less health services but are forced to subsidise the lifestyles of those who get pregnant and take time off work to care for children, as well as all the medical and education costs incurred in the years that follow.

This says everything that you need to know about him. Technically yes most of those points are true but they don't include human nature or the future of our fucking species. Those things are kinda important. 

The vaccination policy I agree with, because despite David Leyonhjelm's views we are a *society*. and vaccinations as well as welfare are essential to that. If you're not prepared to be a part of that society then why should you benefit?

At least this *news story* lives up to the fine, high quality journalism that Yahoo and Channel 7 do so well.
A rare sign of reason
Honestly I think it's time society started treating a refusal to vaccinate as what it is: child neglect. No more beating around the bush, no more wishy washy 'it's a parent's choice to make' nonsense. It is neglect, plain and simple - just as it is neglect to take other idiotic risks with a child's life and wellbeing. 

If someone decided they were morally opposed to seatbelts and child restraints and then sped around with their child in the car, society wouldn't enable their reprehensible behaviour - society would be entitled, in fact *obliged* to act to protect that child and *their* right to health and safety, which quite frankly trumps their parent's right to do whatever the fuck they like.

So, for those willfully blind to common sense: refusing to vaccinate your child based on ~~your 'research'~~ the hours you spent reading Natural News (a choice you made based on your desire for personal exceptionalism rather than actual concern for your child's health) does not make you alternative, healthy, clever, conscientious, knowledgeable, diligent, informed or correct. It does not place you on the smart side of a conspiracy. It makes you a self-absorbed dick. 
SO's ex posted a big thanks to her daycare provider for letting her know about this today...after making our attempts to get their 3 yo vaccinated a nightmare :/ Still refused to admit it was for the welfare then gave us a hard time AGAIN for getting it done to schedule.
Yay!!
Wait, you fuckers get childcare benefits?


*-an American*
Okay, here's the problem:

Even if you're 100% pro-vax, as I am, once you start holding "benefits" over someone's head you have way too much power.

Don't believe me?  Imagine they said "smokers can no longer have health benefits", because it causes mounting medical bills.  Or anyone on government-funded healthcare can't drink alcohol, because of the same reason.

When you're indebted to someone, they have **power over you**.  It happens slowly, insidiously, over time.  But it happens.
Serious question here: If they're going to ban practices which are deadly/pose serious threat to one's health, why don't they just ban smoking as well?  
  
And about the people being employed in the tobacco industry argument, that's not a great reason to support people getting sick and unhealthy, that employment shouldn't have been there in the first place.  
  
It's not like fast food in the sense that there's actual pleasure in the food without getting addicted, in smoking you HAVE to get addicted to get pleasure or more pleasure from it.
As an australian, and a dad.. awww yiss. my little girl might NOT get polio!

Straya ain't fucking around
I'm glad this has happened in my country. The anti vaccination movement is criminally misguided.
And here comes the circlejerk....again
As a medicine student I am filled with joy that a country does something about these parents that unnecessarily put their children life in danger.

Granted most of them will not die when they do get ill, but most of them are handicapped mentally of physically. 

If you ask me, if their child gets handicapped sue them for neglect... or is this too harsh
Whilst I am very pro-vaccination, I am anti this law.  Because today they are banning anti-vaxxers, tomorrow they are banning those who haven't paid their rates bill.  This is bad news.

Edit: the exanple was extreme to make the point - this time they make the condition for something you agree with, next time it may not be something you agree with, but it may be something that will surprise you that others agree with. Consider also the actions of governments lately that have surprised you, and which gave been unpopular - do you really think that they won't go ahead with actions they think are unpopular? 

Consider where the future is potentially going in the next 20 years: significantly fewer jobs, overpopulation, a lot of resource scarcity, new lifestyle and military  technology and the medical technology to live forever. There may not be enough to go around. Those in power may need ways to cull the heard. The weak will be picked on,  and the common people will be too busy trying to survive to argue. The slippery slope may become an avalanche.
So there is this to be said. I believe one of the primary reasons the anti vaccination movement exists is because you never actually see any data in the pro vaccination arguments from sources other than pharmaceutical companies or government organizations, that often times seem to be in bed with each other.  In fact the data to be so skewed that just looking at the positive data may make someone think something is up.  

I of course didn't settle for this as I trust science as a whole and so asked my friend who is a Bio-chemist with a PhD from MIT his thoughts and if he could show me some independent sources for data confirming. He did. I vaccinated my child because of this, and am pro vaccination now.

I really think people have to stop saying "because science" in their pro vax arguments and stop using big business or big gov sources as they have been historically manipulated in other regards to provide desired results. People should start actually engaging people in a meaningful way with actual independent data. Give people the respect they deserve, they don't all just act this way to be a thorn in your side.
as badly as i wanna shout "YEAH FUCK THOSE ANTI VAX PIECES OF SHIT" im also worried that this will just mean children and families who need those benefits will not get them. this is not the way to combat a complete and total dilusion. this wont change their minds, only put their children even more at risk.
This is the first time in a long time where I haven't been embarrassed to be an Australian while browsing the front page.  That said, I'm a shitcunt and haven't read the article yet.
Do they also ban smokers from getting health benefits?
Aren't most anti vaxers upper middle class anyway?  They don't need the childcare benefits.  So if they are choosing not to vax due to concern for their child's health (right or wrong), this won't affect their decision.  At least not the majority of them anyway.
What's this? My country is being progressive all of a sudden?
... and then the children suffer. 

Not sure this is well thought out.
I'm all for vaccinations, but how does cutting off child care money promote the health and well-being of children?
Why the sideways laws though?

I mean, if you want kids immunised, bring in a law that does that.
"All children must be immunised" with the obvious caveats for medical reasons.

To me it seems stupid to bring in laws that just seem spiteful - and which won't actually help if these parents just take the financial hit.

Do Australians want herd immunity for their children, or some kind of vindictive sense you've "punished" anti-vaxxers? The article seemed to suggest that some of the political support was just from political parties who don't think Australia should have a future. i.e For them stopping help was something they wanted to do regardless of jabs or not - really the guy quoted seems to hate kids for some irrational reasons.
That is great !
I guess "it's my body and i will do with it what i want" only applies to murdering unborn children and doing drugs.
[deleted]
So there's a weird misconception here about this being targeted towards the poor. Which I guess maybe true but you'd be shocked what the payments are to just general middle class people too.

My partner and I both work full time, we're both university educated and make pretty good money, though we turned down higher paying jobs for lifestyle/passion reasons, if we had kids we'd have taken the higher paying jobs and be earning more. We're only 30 but I put our incomes into one of the government benefit calculators and said we had 3 kids, a 15, 5 and 1 year old. For context we earn over $100k after tax.

The calculator estimated benefit payments of $604.94 per fortnight. Which is just under $16k a year.

That's just the one I looked at, there are also benefits to cover specific costs associated with parenting, there's also money to cover the cost of kindergarten/preschool. 

Also a one off $2k payment for the first kid and then $1k per kid after that when they're born.

This can all add up to a lot of money, and we're not some poor starving family. In fact we already live in a 4 bedroom home we own anyway, we could have 3 kids and it wouldn't ruin us. But the government currently comes along and gives non-starving people like us money anyway.

Actually while searching around I decided to look up the governments budget documents for 2015-16.

A household with 2 kids, one under 6 and one between 6-13 years old, with a household income of $100k per year will pay ~$17k in taxes and receive &gt;$20k in benefits. Leaving a $3k shortfall.

This house has a "Full time taxpayer contribution" value of 0.2. That means for every 5 of these households there needs to be 1 single person with no kids and receiving no benefits earning $80k per year just to make up for that shortfall (basically me). There's at least 10 of those families just on my street, combined with the pensioners living down the other end we may be the only people in our neighbourhood actually paying taxes...

Now if by some statistical fluke my measles vaccination didn't work and I've been protected this whole time by heard immunity, and some little un-vaccinated brat knocks me out of work, then what happens? I love my partner but I doubt she can pay everyone's taxes and my medical expenses too.

Just get your stupid kid vaccinated and stay off my lawn.

Good. If kid's can't bring in peanuts to class to ensure the safety of the one kid with allergies, then kid's shouldn't be allowed to attend public school without being vaccinated, so the exact same reason.

Vaccinating protects those most vulnerable, refusing to follow standard, medical practice over disproven and frankly, idiotic ideas surrounding risks that just don't exist, is foolish at best, criminal at worst.

Wait a minute, so if someone decides they don't want children - they shouldn't contribute to betterment of society through each generation? 
I am 100% pro-vax, I think it's important, and I think it is sensible. BUT, I do not agree at all with the government holding parents, and particularly mothers will be impacted by this, to ransom. Beat your kid up, refuse to read or play with them, malnourish and neglect them, teach them to be racist or homophobic, not a worry, you will be paid. But refuse to inject them with a substance that, for whatever reason, you decide is unsafe for your child and that's it, you're out of the game. I can't support it. I just can't.
I'm fine with vaccinations. However, this seems like an infringement of rights.
It is all warm and fuzzy when the government means well, but power always corrupts people and this decision will allow control over citizens via injection in the future.

I don't care how nice you are, but isn't it going a little far to demand that I don't have a right to refuse chemicals being injected into my body? If I can't even control that, what can I control.
Nice to know we can still do some non-sports things right. Straya FTW!
To say that vaccines cannot or will not cause harm is disingenuous because they do.

In the United States, if you or your child is harmed or killed by a vaccine you have no right to sue the manufacturer. Big Pharma is the only entity that cannot be sued for an injurious or deadly product. All vaccine injury/death claims must go through the [National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.](http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/index.html) No other corporation is given this kind of protection.

From 1989 to 2013 the NVICP has paid out more than 2.5 billion dollars to children and their families for vaccine caused injury... and these are taxpayer dollars. Big Pharma pays nothing into the fund.

If you or your child is vaccine injured it can take a decade of arduous litigation to receive compensation. Meanwhile, you will have to pay out of pocket for any medical problems caused by vaccines.

Edit: formatting

I'm entirely in favour of this.

EDIT: Uh-oh! Jenny McCarthy downvoted me!
 Reddit loves to mock college students for wanting safe spaces and shit like that but sees nothing wrong with going apeshit over anti-vax and getting outraged about *other people* smoking cigarettes.
I'm not anti-vaccination but I am anti-mandatory vaccination. Unfortunately most people don't have the cognitive complexity to distinguish between the two positions. And whilst this isn't law is mandatory per se, it is mandatory for those parents who need benefits (which is awful in and of itself, targeting poor parents whilst letting rich parents off the hook).

Also, this is regarding the Autism argument, the media portrays Autism as a disease which makes you incompatible with modern day society, my cousin has severe autism, and he has a girlfriend and a child, most people with Autism are normal people with their brains wired differently, an obvious exception is the ones that can't speak and the like, but most people with Autism are normal people, with normal lives, but different brains.
Good for them. Congrats, mates!
Wish there was a way to ban stupid. How fucking dumb do people need to be to be against vaccinations ? The government gives you something good for free, and you refuse it. And then you expect to get money from the government that you do not trust.

Maybe if anti vaxers are all sterilized the heredity effects of their stupid genes won't pass to the next generation. Would still have to deal with the brainless subhuman trash like Jenny McCarthy spreading vaccination skepticism. Death penalty for causing harm to society would be a good idea I think.

And why is this so common in developed christian countries like America and Australia ? 
Proud to be Australian today!
A bit harsh, but necessary.  Anti-vaxxers are fools.  The only reason anyone should be exempt from vaccination is if they (or their children) have an allergy to at least one of the ingredients (yes, that is a thing, though it is extremely rare) or have compromised immune systems.  
I get that the anti-vaxxers are retarded, but should we really be pushing this hard in the other direction?   There have been bad vaccines before, and there are profiteering groups who's interest it is to make everyone want to load up on vaccines.  I remember reading that Tamiflue ultimately didn't do anything other than make friends of Dick Cheney rich.  Plus there was that recent vaccine that gave people narcolepsy.  I'm not sure we should be creating an culture that doesn't question the government because... science.
Moments like this I'm proud to be Australian.
Happy happy joy joy! This is a win for common sense, and in my country? Awesome!
Good, the only language stupid people can understand; Money.
What happens when they want you to take a vaccine that is highly controversial? For ex. the bird flu vaccination was pure bullshit.
Does this mean those parents don't have to pay the taxes associated with vaccines? It only makes sense. 
I fail to see how turning these people into pariahs will improve public health. If you shun people away from the system then they will do dumb and dumber shit.
As for the subsidizing of "other people's" kids, that guy is an idiot. Your economy will fail if your birth rate falls to low, hurting everyone.  Taxes to pay for schools, children's health care, parks, etc are investments in your societies future.  I want to grow up to be that 80 year old guy asking some young kid how the next iPhone, laptop, VR, thingamaboberdilly works because they took what we built and made it better. 
Why do anti-vaxers actually think that the government/scientists/whoever actually want to cause people to be autistic?  
[Kinda like this then I see](https://rickkelo.liberty.me/wp-content/uploads/sites/904/2014/06/StatismIdeasSoGoodTheyHaveToBeMandatory.jpg)
Some people should not be allowed to have children.
I'm brazilian, and I'm sad to say that anti-vaxes movements have been gaining strength around here. 10 years ago there was no one questioning the vaccination campaign. Today you see people believing in this conspiracy theories everywhere. Easy access to information have it's costs.
My mother is all for vaccinations but she doesn't think the government should tell parents how to raise their kids. I say that if the parents putting a child's life at risk then they're not fit to make those kinds of decisions for their child.
&gt; Liberal Democrats Senator David Leyonhjelm, speaking in support of the measures, said childless families should not have to subsidise the lifestyles of those who choose to have "little blighters".

Who elected that moron?! We are not immortals, so creation and upbringing of new members of society is an absolutely essential duty of any government.

 Even if you can't have children - you will still benefit from the children of others on whom you are going to rely then you get too old to work.
One more example of the global trend of government and state trampling on the rights of the individual to satisfy some collective hysteria. My warning is to those people who think that this is a good idea, start thinking about the moral consequences to this type of action in terms of future government policy and action.
Thank God. If you want to be an ignorant git let your children suffer, not mine.
just call it what it is: child abuse, and remove their parental rights
Aren't the kids already being punished enough by their fuckhead parents? This is incentive to vaccinate your kids, but the parents are the ones who should suffer the consequences, not the kids. Make it a damn crime and take the kids away from them to be placed with sane people who will do everything they can to keep them healthy.
&gt; Senator Leyonhjelm thanked and apologised to childless Australians.

&gt; They get next to no welfare, pay more tax and use less health services but are forced to subsidise the lifestyles of those who get pregnant and take time off work to care for children, as well as all the medical and education costs incurred in the years that follow.

&gt; And in the case of those who want to have children but can't, forcing them to subsidise those with children is like making people in "wheelchairs pay for other people's running shoes", he said.

Wow. Wise words like these coming from a politician is not something you see everyday.

I'm all for stripping these health benefits from anti-vaxers, provided they're also exempted from paying the taxes that go for it.
This makes sense, it's necessary to protect not only specific children, but the general population. And, as you mention, there is an exception for children who have a medical reason to avoid vaccinations. Just want to say, the supposed study showing a link between vaccination and autism WAS A HOAX, look into it. The 'article' in an obscure healthstore newsletter that reported the 'deaths' of 20, 000 Indian children from polio vaccines, WAS A HOAX, look into it. The idea that westerners vaccinate Muslim populations to cause male sterility, or because Bill Gates wants to take over the world, ALSO FALSE. Now, children and adults are dying or disabled from completely preventable diseases, and health care workers are targeted and sometimes killed over TOTAL NONSENSE.
A better solution would be to make vaccinations mandatory.
excellent. a step forward.

not getting your child vaccinated = child abuse.
Good. There should be consequences for stupidity.
My mums anti-vac, never really asked why cause I didn't care and am afraid of needles. Will probably either catch up when I move out or die horribly 
This would be an excellent law to have world wide.

Herd immunity is for the herd, which I am gratefully not a part of. 
Take a note from Australia's playbook, rest of the world.
Haha, suck it you anti vax fuck tards
I wholeheartedly endorse this policy. Many lives will be saved. 
Over here along with Anti Vaxxers there are also many parents who just "Can't be bothered" to vaccinate children (usually linked to drug/alcohol abuse).  Hopefully the promise of a few extra dollars per year will motivate these people to look after their kids.
This really annoys me. The comment that adults without children shouldn't have to subsidise those who do are absolutely toxic and a true danger to civilised society. 

When we pay taxes, we cannot think selfishly about ourselves in the 'here and now'. It is incredibly sorry sighted. 

I'm sure that every adult without child in Australia has at some point in their life: had an education; Received child benefit; Had access to some form of universal health care. This is what we pay taxes for, to cover our own development. To take full advantage of a system then to suggest that others should not be afforded the same rights is deplorable. 

I wonder who funded Senator Leyonhjelm's education or if his mother skipped on picking up his child benefit cheque.

Good. If you want society's aid, you can't be potentially infecting society because you read something on the Internet.
This is sad. 

I thought anti-vac is an American-only phenomenon. 
The only problem with it is neglect to take other idiotic risks with a hostage.
Good.  Proof even our right-nut-job crazies, of which we have a few, don't run our government, in spite of the conservatives being in power.
A Liberal wants to cut welfare? What?
"But we have rights!"
I'm not agreeing...but isn't this punishing the child because the parents are retarded?
This is excellent news! Force these deluded to save their kids lives...
Well reddit will be happy
Waitin for other countries to follow...
"Little blighters" That is wonderful
So let's go ahead and punish the kids for dipshit parenting. Great idea...
This needs crosslinked to r/childfree.
The senator's comments freak me out a bit.
Hey world! Look at what Australia is doing! Now so the same thing! 

Seriously... Keep being awesome, Australia 
hi
For those too lazy to read the article, since the TLDR bot didn't mention it: there will be exceptions made for those with legitimate medical reasons not to vaccinate.
&gt;childless families should not have to subsidise the lifestyles of those who choose to have "little blighters".

BWAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

I love the way Australians phrase things.  "Little Blighters"

Sounds like a gang
lol owned
The punishment for non-compliance is only going to hurt more children. Also I think anti vax correlates with high income so it probably won't be that effective.
Ohhhh man that shit would not fly here in America. So many liberal heads would literally explode if Congress tried to pass something like that! 
I'm not sure how I feel about him wanting to strip all welfare benefits from parents.

He does make some good points though, why should I pay for other peoples kids? I'm not Australian by the way.

But he makes it out to imply the tax dollars non-parents pay are actually quite a fucking bit and its unfair.

However on the other hand I was once a child this is kinda our paying it forward since the previous generation did that for us. Of course again I'm not Australian and this issue doesn't affect me but the argument is interesting because its one of the reasons republican voters are against universal healthcare in the USA. Why should I pay for your medical bills they ask.

Could some Australian people chime in here on this?
They should not remove the child's health care. The child didn't make the stupid fucking choice.  However they should remove the parents healthcare. Just my 2¢.
Fun fact:
You can be exempt if you have a letter from a representative of "the church of Christ"

Unfortunately it's not the lower income families  that would utilize these benifits that are anti vaxxers.
Can anyone tell me if my sister in law will be affected. She is a single parent, non vax and she works part time,  she does receive family payment but not child care allowance as a relative babysits
Man, I know I don't know how you get to $100k that you need to put the /s at the end.
IT kind of makes sense. I understand these ppl. I should become à diplomat
IT kind of makes sense. I understand these ppl. I should become à diplomat
Are there minimum required vacs? or all or nothing?
I don't understand how this punishes anyone other than the kids... 
But they still have to pay the taxes for it right? 
Excellent idea, make children pay for their parents mistakes. \s
Wow, thought I was going to hate this article, but it focused on freedom. Who would have thought that childless people shouldn't have to subsidize those with children? Ah the joys of democracy where no ones wallet is safe from the parasite coalition. 
For me all of the wealthy upper-class are getting their kids vaccination.
Personally, I was pregnant.
Most people don't know much about vaccines. Most people don't know that one of the most effective vaccines is a nasal spray with a crippled but living virus. There's a logic here, it's that if your body has to contend with a live virus, it's going to develop a stronger immune reaction. If anti-vaxxers simply don't want the usual shots, but want the sprays or possible other types of future virus, they shouldn't be penalized for it. For they are actually strengthening the herd immunity. 

I didn't really want my child to get the chickenpox vaccine, she did, but I'd have rather she hadn't, because it would mean a longer time, perhaps even a lifetime immunity from chickenpox (assuming her body came into contact with it at some later point and soundly killed it). There are other good reasons for having the shot though, like if you live with elderly people and don't want to risk them getting something that could be life-threatening.
Does that mean they get a tax credit? or are they SOL on the taxes they pay toward that program?
Who profits from this anti-vax bullshit? Whenever people are being idiots concerning social policies, there's usually a lobby that talked some bullshit into them that opposes all scientific evidence.
All this shit about anti vaccination but can someone r ell me what exactly modern vaccines contain and which method is applied? I know how vactination came and also that if I remember are two methods of viruses that are given : weakend and dead. What else goes into vaccine?  Suppresents or some shit like that?

 Thanks.
Freedom????

Yeah! Fuck those kids in particular!  Your parents are fuckups, so fuck you too!
Profits! not People! 
So, the child now is in worse condition. Ok.
I really don't like the precedent that this creates. Why punish children because you don't like the ideology of their parents? 
Then the people shouldnt have to pay taxes. I'm a molecular biologist  but i still disagree with being forced to pay a government to force the injection of a conconction of antigens and adjuvants into newborns.
Look, I dislike Anti-vaxers too, but whats the point of this? These are people who dont give a fuck that their child could get an entirley preventable illness. Why would this change their mind?

This just hurts the kids. This doesnt stop these children from needing to be fed and clothed by their family.
The US needs this. 
Oh God I wish we would do that here in the US. 
Good.

Seriously, if you refuse to vaccinate your kids because your think the government is on some global conspiracy to give your kids Autism or whatever, what the fuck are you taking the government's blood money for?
Well that's a slippery slope. What's next? Eat more than 3 slices of pepperoni pizza in a week and forfeit your socialized healthcare?
My vaccines dont work until anti-vaxxers vaccinate themselves. Im so scared that my vaccines will fail to protect me because johnny didnt absorb the needle.
How about drug testing welfare recipients?

Nah...that's discriminating!

*sigh*
I love Australia's no bs approach. 
Yay, more government telling people what to do.  I know this is gonna get downvoted by Reddit, it always does, but this is a bad thing round and round.  It is unfortunate people are stupid enough to not vaccinate their children, and it is also unfortunate the government is expanding its power.  What's not unfortunate, but stupid, is Reddit's applause at this.
This is fucked up.
Nature will find a way... 
But do they still have to pay tax for childcare benefits? That would be kinda strange if you're not allowed to benefit but still have to pay.
Good
about bloody time! I live in the uk and a neighbour once said to me that she didnt get her kid vaccinated because it was "illegal in england". fuck! tell me you didnt vaccinate because the aliens would select your child for anal probing but dont tell me this bollocks! 
Good. People that willingly and deliberately create serious health risks for my children shouldn't be sponsored by the government. 
Great news. My only issue is the implication that if your rich enough to not need the CCB then thus hss zero impact on you, so one rule for the wealthy and one for everyone else. 

Why not just ban kids from attending altogether - unless they have a legitimate medical reason?
"NO JOB NO PAY.."
Typo in the headline, Channel Seven. 
Can anti-vax folks start a religion and gain immunity from this law?
Can anti-vax folks start a religion and gain immunity from this law?
How about you just defy their will and vax?
I'm an Auasie and a taxpayer as far as I'm concerned good job! Not vaccinating not only puts your kid at risk but everyone else's. Alot of the country feels the same way
Instead of taking their benefits, surely a fairer way would be to ensure informed decision making - if someone doesn't want their kid vaccinated, then give the parent polio and *then* let them make an informed decision on whether they want to risk their child catching it?
Do they have to stop paying taxes for childcare benefits then?

I'm totally fine with them keeping their money to spend it on themselves how they want.
punish children for the idiocy of their parents.
Good. I'm glad this has passed. It's infuriating that people discount the millions of lives vaccinations have saved in preference for the rare occasions where something does go wrong. 
so children with asshat parents get to starve to death too? 


What is reason behind anti-vaccination...some like anti-abortion...religious reason?
that law is discrimination, it discriminate people base on their believes. =|
All legit reasons to not vaxx excluded, three words left : this is great ! 
Can we just start giving those parents smallpox?
Wish they did the same in america
i bet the rich don't get their kids done.
This will only hurt under privileged children and won't convince their parents to vax them..
Good.  Will they also ban them from taxes to pay for other people's kids too?
Anti-Vax People are dumb. They will not vax anyways. So this legislation will hurt the children, not the dumb parents. Not helping at all. Rich people are often the most ignorant :/
Doesn't this punish the children in the end?
Man, I'm so happy I plan on moving to Australia next year. Can't wait.
A big F**k You to the Aussie government. You bunch of big babies. You're not our mother. 
*"No vaxain, let your measly mumpy children stahve"*
Taxing stupidity one wallaby at a time.
Proud to be Aussie as fuck.

For the parents whose children have ACTUAL medical reasons- I'm glad you are considered separate to the anti vax muppets.

America behind on the times lmfao
Another freedom loss for the poor
The only reason I can't agree to this is that 1% of people who actually do have negative responses to injections.

As someone whose prone to going into shock and suffocating if I give plasma or do inoculations too quickly, I'm not anti-vax for any pseudo-science reason. I just don't want to die, thanks. If I take note my kid displaying similar symptoms to me, I'm not going to avoid vaccinations because of pseudo-science. I just don't want him to suffocate to death, kthanx.

I'd get a vaccination, as as well as my own future kids, when I'm older and more calmed. 
[deleted]
&gt; Senator Leyonhjelm thanked and apologised to childless 

&gt; Australians. They get next to no welfare, pay more tax and use less health services but are forced to subsidise the lifestyles of those who get pregnant and take time off work to care for children, as well as all the medical and education costs incurred in the years that follow.

This guy &lt;3 

fuck you breeders
Why cant this be made mandatory? Or punished by law if you don't do it?

The extra crazy ones will just go without the childcare.

YES! YES! You STUPID fucking retards! Punish the children some more, what, with catching all kinds of diseases let them suffer from malnourishment and lack of clothes as well. 
I like this. I like this a lot. More of this please.
anti-anti vaaxers always rubbed off wrong on me, there's like an undercurrent of sadism or schadenfraude that always permeates these discussions, i dunno man.

Tourist revenues in Niagria Falls are going to up.  Way up.
Justin Trudeau at the G-20: "Ah, guys... I thought this was the G-420." 
What's happens when it becomes legalized? Is it all across Canada or do provinces choose whether to follow suit?
He is the dankest prime minister on earth.
What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. 
As a Buffalonian, 19 and 20 year olds are going to Canada to get drunk now. I can see the future, and it looks pretty good for Canadian tourism.
Well, I wonder if I'll make that $20 I bet against my friend. I said legalization before 2020 he said after. This was like 5 years ago before Trudeau was really on the radar. 
Maple Syrup Edibles for Everyone!!!!!
Canadians so have all the chill.
Can we just elect Trudeau as well? Canamerica, anyone?
This guy doesn't waste any time. 

Take a look politicians, it doesn't take years of bitching or haggling to get things done.

Edit: I get it folks, the US government and the Canadian governments are different. I'm fully aware of this, thanks. It still impressed me nonetheless.

It'd be pretty nice.
Finally! Fuck yeah! Lets get selling this in stores and funneling money to our school systems please!
When it's legalized where can I buy some? I've never smoked weed in my life.
Trailer Park Boys is going to need to adapt here
Canada is about to out-freedom America.
Ricky and the gang about to be broke 
I can't wait to be able to grow my own at home. 
For all you confused Americans: the reason this is happening so quickly is because the Prime Minister has direct control over the House of Commons (the equivalent to the House of Representatives). Imagine the President and the Speaker of the House positions merged into one. 
Because it's 2015

Canadian Policies going on its right path !!
Bill C-420, also known as the K.U.S.H. Act
Title is a little misleading. Mandate letters are just a formal summary of the minsters' goals. No tangible steps have yet been taken toward legalization beyond the PM saying "we're going to do this at some point," which we already knew. 
doing Buddy Jesus' work.
dude weed lmao
Justin Trudeau for US President 2016
I love the idea that Canada has a weed legalization process all laid out, ready for someone to flip the switch.
His mom used to smoke weed at 24 Sussex, so it's not that surprising.
It's that easy? All he had to do was nod and they pressed the Snoop shaped button to release weed from the skies?

Execute order 420
Never thought I'd say this, but:

Canada, please annex us. 
420 blaze it
Finally this should have been done ages ago. Eventually it will be passed throughout most of the US. I feel like the areas where they have no drinking zones (Dry counties) will be the slowest.

Legalizing weed might also reduce the hard drug use problem in Canada. 
Canada gets it.
Uhhh why has this got down voted so hard in the last 5 hours
Can he just do that? What's the process actually like? I mean I'm as for it as anyone and good for Canada but does at least the way the title is worded worry anyone else? 
This is the only mention of legalizing marijuana in the mandate letter to the Canadian justice minister:

(Which, if you have been following Canadian politics, the idea that "The justice minister will begin the process of legalizing marijuana in Canada" has been well known for some time now.)
Initiate the process!

It was a bit embarrassing when the United States beat us to legalization. 
I will say that I initially had my doubts about Trudeau's ability to run Canada.  I still hope that he can fix the economy or at least appoint somebody to advise him that can.
But the moral of the country has certainly changed since his election.  
I hope that can catch on and fix our economy.

Trudeau orders Justice Minister to start trying to legalize weed.

Reddit: "OMG YOU GUYS WEED IS LEGAL IN CANADA NOW!  WOOO GO TRUDEAU!!!"
For those interested, this was discussed in the UK last month and was quickly put to rest with the words:
"Substantial scientific evidence shows cannabis is a harmful drug that can damage human health. There are no plans to legalise cannabis as it would not address the harm to individuals and communities."
https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/104349

I feel like there are more pressing issues at hand right now. Namely the massive influx of refugees Canada is about to take in.

Edit: love the downvotes from the butt hurt stoners. The refugee crisis is a Real, time sensitive issue that  can't just be swept under the rug with a few bong hits. I enjoy a toke as much as the next guy, but I'm more concerned about my country's safety then where I can buy my next bag. Enjoy your rose colored glasses. 
lmao
The father gave Canada universal healthcare and now the son is give Canada legalized weed, how can you not love the Trudeau family? 
I'm packing my stuff and leaving for Canada, who's coming?
I have a serious question, legalizing it is great and all, but most jobs require you to partake in a drug test, which generally test for marijuana. I've never had any interest in smoking, but what if I wanted too? I've got a job that has very strict drug policies, but if marijuana is legal, shouldn't that be something that doesn't disqualify you from your job anymore? 
Thank you Justin Trudeau for restoring my faith in Canada. Thank goodness that reptilian Harper is out of the picture.
The gridlocked regressive USA is going to end up sitting between legalized Mexico and Canada... What a fucking disgrace.
Sometimes it just makes more sense for the legislative to be the executive too.
&gt;In a public mandate letter issued to Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould Friday, Trudeau listed the government's top priorities, including working with the Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and Health ministers to "create a federal-provincial-territorial process that will lead to the legalization and regulation of marijuana."

Error on that page.. these are the mandate letters issued to the Ministers privately by Trudeau when they were invited to become those cabinet positions _before_ the swearing in ceremony, they were only just made public as was announced to happen when they announced the cabinet positions.


Is Canada currently taking recruits?

BOOM HEADSHOT!
Goddamnit, of course this happens two weeks after I quit. 
I'm surprised they aren't in treaties preventing this.
Not sure why, but I read this as "Justin Theroux has officially ordered" and thought it was hilarious the guy who wrote Tropic Thunder and Zoolander 2 was in any sort of power to order anyone to do anything.
I bet he must have parliament's full support. Otherwise such move wouldn't be possible.
That headline is so odd.

It make me think of Trudeau picking up the ~~Red~~ Green Phone, saying "Get me the Justice Minister!" and then a moment later, portentously: "Madam Minister, I'm hereby issuing you the order: ***start the weed legalization process.***"
w'lin
Wow, that was a 420-degree turn in Canada's domestic politics!
Wait, so Mexico and Canada are going to legalize weed? 
Canada legalizing, Mexico legalizing, it's a squeeze play and were the middle-man. I give up. Make it happen. 
A little late but I'm looking forward to legal and taxed pot.

What happens to people who have been sent to jail for possessing weed when the bill goes through? Do they get released?
Ricky is gonna be pissed
If Canada just get's some faster internet and better sewage treatment systems, it'll be heaven on earth :)

Oh who am I kidding... They have Tim Horton's on every corner.  It's already heaven!
Gotta pay for those babyboomers somehow. At least we'll have fun doing it.

Hey /u/losrockster,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Vivement la Société des Alcools et Cannabinoïdes du Québec!
Only half correct, Trudeau is nationalizing weed, if you sell weed without a license, you will be punished more severely, maybe the same with buying but not sure.
Canada. The whole country is going to pot.
Meanwhile in BC the RCMP is shutting down all the dispensories on Vancouver Island for some reason.

Its a joke

"Ms. Minister of Justice, start the weed legalization process." - Justin Trudeau
How much does my net worth have to be in order to get the rushed 24-hour Canadian citizenship?
The Trailer Park Boys episode based on this ought to be friggin awesome. 
It would be great if that was exactly how he worded it: start the weed legalization process.
I read that as Justin Timberlake.  I mean, I know that kid has pull, but damn.
They are cool with finding new jobs if it costs them a few pennies.
Based Trudeau
Did anyone else read Justin Morneau and think wow, I didn't know he had so much power over Canada?

A small conversation about this...worth looking at. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/nanaimo/comments/3slzco/nanaimo_dispensaries_ordered_to_shut_down/
There doesn't seem to be any news coverage of this at all on CBC, CTV, Global, etc. Weird.
Get 'er dun
There goes the Planet!
What do you guys think the age limits will be once this becomes set in stone in the next few years? I assume it'll vary by province? Quite curious if on an ideological level Canadian governments will agree to allow the drinking and smoking age to be the same.
Neat! Hopefully this common sense will drift south of the border as well. 
I have a couple general questions about legalization...

1. When should we expect to have this legalized? I'm not looking for a specific date, but should I expect the legalization process to take 1 week or 1 year?

2. Will the prices of weed in dispensaries be higher than the street price of weed? Or will it be lower. I know a lot of people I know are saying that weed is going to triple in size because of the demand that there is, but a lot of people are also speculating that it's going to lower drastically, because the amount of growers.


Thanks.

fuck off, vice
So I'll be in Calgary and Banff early January...think this will be in effect by then?
Can anyone estimate a timeline from this point to actual dispensaries? I'm guessing it greatly depends on whether we're getting provincially controlled dispensaries or licensed third parties.
I hope this is for real - if only from the Joe Rogan-esque idea that it's absolutely absurd to lock people in cages for owning a piece of a plant...
Wait, how is this able to be done so fast after going into office?

Yeah buddy!

Blueberry yum yum!
My man Justin knows where the money is!
Unmm hey Canada... Got room for one more?
I love how the authorities will throw around the old saying, "If you've got nothing to hide...", but constantly try to hide dealings that will have a huge impact on the lives of their citizens.

It was inevitable. This is what the communists were warning about - that someday corporations would be more powerful than governments.

People don't want to face it, but America is not governed by its people, it is governed by corporate interests, and Europe is almost there.

Every bad decision by the US government - from invading Iraq to calling for Assad to be deposed, or allowing fracking, allowing medical care to be unaffordable etc, has been designed to benefit companies rather than the American people.

Bear in mind Exxon was exposed for covering up climate change for over 30 years . Their upper management are sociopaths   
These big corporations despise democracy.

These deals are removing people's say in their own countries.
The TTIP has been specifically set up to ENSURE corporate exploitation over ordinary people, that's why it was all done in secret. Somewhat pathetic to say 'exploitation could happen' when it was set up so that it most certainly WOULD happen per it's intrinsic design.
This kind of bullshit is fucking absurd, public representatives are selling out people's democracies to corporate interests. How is this not treason?!?
All the dystopian scifi was right. Corporations rule us now. 
This article is about the US easing energy export restrictions. Reddit is so quick to take the "corporate interests squashing the little guy" point of view that most people are totally ignoring the actual situation. 

The US has export restrictions solely for energy security reasons. These restrictions were put in place before the shale oil boom which has enabled the US to be more than self sufficient in oil and especially LNG. As things currently stand, Europe imports huge amounts of oil and gas from Russia and the Middle East, on prices that are more expensive than the US could supply. These antiquated export restrictions help Russia and the Middle East and hurt American energy firms and EU consumers.

Trade restrictions are not the way to combat climate change. I am totally in favor of a carbon tax, or barring that better carbon exchanges and other forms of reducing carbon emissions. Contrary to this poorly written and misleading article linked from the OP,  this particular trade restriction does not reduce global emissions.

As for the sharing of "confidential negotiating strategies", again people are not really understanding what is going on here. These strategies are confidential because it's a negotiation, not for any more nefarious reasons. Exxon Mobile has incentives very much aligned with the EU here (liberalization of US export market). When you are in a negotiation, if there is a party with the same incentives as you and deep pockets, it just makes sense to share strategy with them and ask opinions.

This comment will probably get buried because it goes against the Reddit ethos of evil corporations exploiting the common man. But as a US citizen who considers themselves quite liberal and very much opposed to climate change I can't find anything wrong with this. I hope people will take the time to look into this a bit deeper.
Such a shitty article. Government's seek advice from affected stakeholders for complex trade negotiations, more news at 11. I mean, the EU *wants* access to US O&amp;G exports, so who better to consult as to the best strategy than actual O&amp;G companies that have to deal with both markets?

And before people jump on the "but people are a stakeholder too!" bandwagon, that's why NGOs get a similar level of access, and why 28 national member state parliaments + the European Parliament (which, let's not forget, shot down ACTA) have the final say. 

&gt;But John Cooper, the group’s director, said that its “two wishes” were for full access to crude oil, and a more developed gas market allowing price equalisation between the EU and US.

Wow, truly sinister stuff! Doesn't matter though. Some completely inane comment like "TTIP sucks dicks" will be at the top of this submission in due course anyway.
We can do more than bitch about it.  Call your senators and congresspeople.  Write them emails.  Leave a damn message at their office!  All you have to do is tell them "I'm against the TPP and TTIP.  As your constituent I demand you vote against the implementation of these bills."  That's all.  Tell their interns or whomever answers and they will log your stance.  When enough of their constituents make the case, they will either do as you bid or you should vote them out.  [Congress](http://www.house.gov/)  and   [Your Senators by State](http://www.senate.gov/senators/states.htm)
and the world's elites continues to fuck us up the ass
Letting ExxonMobil in on negotiations is hardly in the top 10 most offensive things about this bill.   
Ruxin's gonna be pissed
Hmmm. seems like an oligarchy, thanks to its campaign funding laws which basically still the intellectual capital from other countries to effectively overrule Canadian law.
"Too sensitive to be released" is basically the same as telling your current girlfriend that your texts with your ex are too sensitive to be released. 
How shocking that a major business involved in international trade would also be involved in an international trade agreement negotiating process.
Isnt it standard procedure to include inudstry representatives in trade talks?
Duh, and or hello.
This doesn't concern any of you.  Move along now.  Thank you for your cooperation. 
Lets not develop and move away from oil, let's just concentrate on money.
As the TPP/TTIP trolls always chime in: "Treaties must be negotiated in secret."
I'd rather buy oil from America than the Saudis...
So what are we going to do about it? Bitch and complain on the internet?
International trade negotiations have become nothing more than a means for multinational corporations to circumvent the democratic process and impose their will on the people. 
OMG!! And other faux outrage.
Pretty much in line with what we already knew. The entire deal is extremely one-sided, just like TPP. It is good that this gets more attention though.
I am Jack's complete lack of surprise
I don't see how this constitutes collusion. 
so if they had to go to europe for this...

look how much of a liar this makes everyone claiming they are "in on" the tpp?  so in on it they had to beg corrupt european governments to give them insight on trade...
"Too sensitive"

Next thing you know Europeans might demand change and government reform.
Are we the bad guys?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToKcmnrE5oY
This is how these treaties are meant to work. Western governments consult western companies in order to understand what policies will help them compete internationally. How else would the government even know what they want the trade rules to be? This story is a big nothing.
To play devils advicate it makes sense to show that kind of information to large businesses rather than ordinary people. Those corporations have a lot if power in the market, which would be very important for a trade deal.
This is how they always do trade deals like this. There were probably people from the tuna industry given the same access. Talking about big oil is just click bait
When can we start demanding to take their heads? France was really good at this at one point in time. I think it's getting to be about that point again.
Don't worry, I'm sure these meetings are just a way to discuss getting the best deals for their customers, there's no way international oil giants would ever do anything to exploit people!.
Corporations are more powerful than many of the countries.
If this dreadful anti democratic fascist document passes I hope we see an uprising on the scale of the Arab spring to take back our freedom and democracy. 
And absolutely nothing will happen just like every other time some shitty part of this deal has come to light.
Uh oh, TTIP is in the headlines again. Looks like it's time for another controversial and polarizing distraction event to happen.
[Collusion!](https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xfp1/t51.2885-15/s320x320/e15/1168471_520928508055362_695226952_n.jpg)
I see the anti-TPP circlejerk has added a vowel this time.
How the fuck is this not the same thing as insider trading! 
The secrecy of these "trade agreements" is insane. Even elected representatives had limited access or were prohibited from discussing the matter with their constituents.

Don't it make you ready to trust your elected officials?...
Why contain it? 

S'cool.
There were probably people from the public at all steps of the leaks.
(Gomer Pyle) Surprise surprise surprise!
I found the article that was original to The Guardian was a better read. http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/26/ttip-talks-eu-alleged-to-have-given-exxonmobil-access-to-confidential-papers
Instead of the process.
Wait, government officials and big oil colude! I could NEVER imagine such a thing!
How can anyone claim we live in a democratic society when not only do the people have no clue what's going on, but our lawmakers are clueless! The people have lost power a long time ago and this deal just hits it home.

We're being toyed with and lied to. 
I think in my lifetime we will see a revolution of some type. I see corporate power becoming too large, and it's only a matter of time before it falls apart. no style of government is perfect, and all are destined to fail eventually.
It would be more newsworthy if it were found that this had not happened.
WOW!!!  WHAT A SURPRISE!!
And nothing will be done about it. Same ol same ol.
So is anyone going to be held responsible? What's being done about this? This collusion is illegal right?
Is there any information on who actually disclosed what?
I'm having a hard time finding the actual sources.
Well that shocked no one.
Surprise??????????
Was there a problem with linking to the *Guardian* article that did the actual reporting?
Please, this HAS to blow up. Please I believe in the European government to fuck them all over. Please....
&gt;confidential negotiating strategies considered too sensitive to be released to the European public.

What, like pulling out people's fingernails or something?
now's the time to "storm the bastille", guys
Uh, yeah. The deal is between governments about business. The common people despise both of those.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT?

Nothing.
[COLLUSION!](https://media0.giphy.com/media/10Gp0wzMg4LB0A/giphy.gif)
We need to pass it before we know what's in it
There's absolutely nothing I can do about this.
Wouldn't there be a a full list of the traitors who signed the tready and it should be easy to hunt them down :/
The best politicians money can buy.
I'd love to see someone take these politicians and CEOs who are merrily colluding to profit off the suffering of the masses, tie them up like hogs and gun them down in the streets like the degenerate scumfucks they are.

Subhuman cretin deserve a death far more agonizing than anything outlawed by The Geneva Convention.

Yes I realize that this is outrageously violent, it won't happen and I shouldn't be wishing death on anyone. I just have utter disdain for these people who capitalize on *humanity* for selfish reasons. They are scum and deserved to be treated as such.
Okay is anyone really surprised?  
Governements do consider big business as stakeholders. They are negotiating for people but also for business. It makes total sense to let the biggies know what's going on. The alternative is to lose trillions in competitive advantage over simple mistakes or miscues.
Skunkmonkey, bringin' the stink...
Let me get this straight.  Corporations are people, just not public people.  Did I get that right?
Fucking arrest them and make a point out of them. The government has no problem making an example out of a person caught with a gram of weed, why not a billion dollar corporation involved in collusion? 
No shit
Awesome, now that we know, what's going to change?
TIL: "sensitive" means insidious.
Fucking cunts 
Just remember folks, Obama is an environmentalist who backs this shit.
Please explain why I should care about this item.
People don't want to be the go to game plan.
To these people, the people of the Arab spring to take back our freedom and democracy.
This is what happens when power goes unchecked.
I have no idea what this means. ELI5?
Exxposed would have been a better title.  Then again, I feel like I've already seen a movie with that title...
Corporations serve their own needs. They harvest the public. We are little more than farmed fish to them. They just dangle something shiny in front of us and watch as we jump in the net.
I'm sure they are being fair and honest and have our best interests in mind. 
Who else thought of "The League" when they read collusion?
I would really like to know how many people are genuinely surprised by this, and how that number correlates to the number of people who are unaware of what the TTIP is.
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/2TnkJ8_BmSI/hqdefault.jpg
Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean they aren't out to get you. 
No shit. Can we just lube up our assholes real nice for the next few decades of bent over fucking we're going to take? We cant do shit about this and they know it.
Well shit, corruption is rampant in the western world of politics
Well then the only logical conclusion is that this needs to be voted down, and EVERYONE involved voted out of office.  EVERYONE, and that includes those that Reddit loves (With a D next to their name)
Don't worry, the free market will fix it!
pray tell what are these confidential negotiating strategies?
To play devils advicate it makes sense to share strategy with them and tell them that saddam hussein supports al-qaida, who we allowed to attack us.
So let's see if I have this straight:
Trade deals are done in the interests of the corporations 
Governments are in love with the cap and tax style schemes to protect the people 
Big oil is getting deals to avert extortion from the regulatory system 
Only sovereign governments have the power to negotiate treaties and the like... 
It would seem almost vulgar if the environmentalists didn't work their way into the deal before the Paris talks fall through. 
Two's company, three is a crowd, this crowd with enough shade to cool the planet back to another ice age. 
Never watch the magicians assistant or the hand holding the rabbit, you'll miss the real show, some pretty dark magic.
It's disgusting to learn what happens behind closed doors.
What! The laws written on pieces of paper dictated by people you voted for on other pieces of paper gave way to human nature?! How could this happen! 
We need to vote once again for better people so this may never happen again!
I don't think anyone should be at all surprised by this. However it is truly sad that we are in a situation today where this sort of thing is almost to be expected.
[MFW](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wxlhyX-4qKI)
So what does this change now that people know about it?
So basically the situation everyone assumed was happening behind the scenes is true. It's so obvious that the process is not the least bit transparent and probably not in the interest of the general public of the countries involved. Gross.
collusion is not an illusion
Can someone please do an ELI5 for me?
Duh. These kinds of things are guaranteed to happen when there is no transparency. 
the european public are all morons - as the EU officials knew - because the european public voted in the EU...lol
Did anyone expect this thing to be above board and benefit the absents? 
All of these counterarguments already.
I understood nothing but fuck the bad guys
I understood nothing but fuck the bad guys
To be honest I think any possible growth of an oil company outside of OPEC is a positive no matter how it happens because OPEC has such a stranglehold over the world.

You are talking about here.
Disgusting
Duh, and or hello.
How is this deal transparent again?
EXPOSED

stopped reading
Now, you can make whatever sinister arguments you want details, or just google them.
Or they may want to learn, be informed, or think critically, they just want to help black citizens with stds but really let them get worse so they can negotiate.
Large oil company could ensure preferential treatment for them and tell them I never vote incumbent under any circumstances.
This is exactly why the myhth exists that if you want details, or just google them.
Bang goes the starting gun and off go the contending conspiracy theories. For example: 

&gt;This is a symptom of an abuse tactic called "gaslighting." The abuser carefully manipulates the truth to always appear to be "good" while doing horrible things. By retelling stories with subtle changes, the abuser takes control by making the victim start to believe they are insane.

or:

&gt; Direct genocide is too expensive and risks a rebellion. Wealthy communities will just insulate themselves as much as possible and roll back support for the rest. If you can convince an increasingly small group of needed workers and professionals that the poor are bringing them down they won't ever think of uniting. It's a very long process that you can already see signs of in North America.

The TTIP process was divided into a series of chapters - environment, energy and so on. States and relevant commercial interests were invited to contribute: this is, after all, a trade treaty. It deals in trade. So it is unsurprising that significant players in energy products were invited to contribute to the energy chapter. 

When the treaty text was complete, it was released for ratification, which is where the democratic process - which includes NGOs, smaller scale commerce, academia and of course the fringe all get to throw their pebbles; or help constructively. [For those who don't understand why trade is beneficial, here's a comic strip](http://www.standupeconomist.com/pdf/cartoon_macro_excerpt.pdf). 
I know I'm parroting, but we have hope in the form of Sanders the man.
Exxon is one of the most vile companies in history
Collusion noun secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy in order to deceive others.
They cooperated but they didn't deceive. They told people it was too sensitive for citizens which could be true because if the documents effect oil prices it's in your best interest that it's not made public. It's just common sense that if you're a member of government looking to build import and export links of oil you ask market leaders how best to do so.
I'm shocked!
Sometimes *The Company* from Prison Break looks like a prophecy waiting to happen
Any negotiating strategies that need to be kept from the public are probably not in the best interest of the public, let alone ethical.
It seems there is little ordinary people can do about this. But can we at least get some cake to eat while we're being fucked over by big business? 
another press release telling the world that governments are corrupt and have been purchased by big corporations. 
Isn't it already well established that large corporations were privy to the negotiations, while the general public was in the dark?
Dude I'm so outraged. Can somebody link me to a senator or congressman that I can bitch to? I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I want to make a difference while eating pizza, laying in bed and watching college football.
is this even a surprise to anyone at this point? ~~the~~ did anyone expect anything less?
It is not at all surprising that when negotiating huge trade deals that impact businesses and streamline trade... That you consult businesses while drafting said agreement. 

Tl,Dr: clickbait.
In other news, American Oil exerts influence on the Greater American Autonomous Territories. How is anyone shocked by this?
My friend said to me today:  
&gt;"Everyone who works for the government always seem shocked when people get upset when they find out that they have been lied to about something. Its like all those governments and government employees keep lying because they keep forgetting that you're not supposed to lie. But the only thing that they actually know how to do is lie."
So much corruption. Fucking oil companies need to get fucked. 
There are no nations any more. Just bankers. Tar.  Feathers.
This is why conservatives are against a strong centralized government and for stronger state government. It's much easier to keep the guy you run into in the grocery store honest than it is to keep a guy who is 3,000 miles away honest. 

The EU is a disaster and should be the counterargument when talking to all the wacky Bernie Sanders supporters out there. 
no doubt there will still be people defending the shit out of the ttip in the comments,

"nah, it'll just lower import taxes... taxes are bad lol"

"it's secret because if the public knew about it, people would not allow it to pass, it's economics silly"


"too sensitive"  translation: "controversial"
How is this not literally oligarchy?
I'm almost positive Rex Tillerson, Exxxonmobil's CEO, spends his free time slowly rotating around in a high-tech chair, petting a fluffy cat and ordering interns to be tossed into a pool full of laser-sharks for leaking info about his plans to construct a fully operational Death Star.
can a TTIP apologist get in here and explain why this is fine pls, thx
Bear in mind Exxon was exposed for covering up climate change for over 30 years . Their upper management are sociopaths   
How is this not treason?
Why am I not surprised.  The  public is kept in the dark but of course big oil companies  can have a part in the decisions. 
Now if only there was a Republican in office so we could talk about the president selling us down the river yet again... #Oblameless 
Saying that, considering our national debts they might not want to admit to manipulating markets to save western countries billions of dollars. It would be nice to know the truth please :)
all these EU official, representatives etc are scum because they didnt tell the public the truth, same goes for the members of various parliaments. they all signed a paper to shut up and they honor the eu omerta more than their duty to serve the people's interests.
Does anybody still think this benefits the citizens of the participating countries??
Even though you are 100% correct, people here do not want to admit to manipulating markets to save western countries billions of dollars.
The prize by Daniel Yergin and Private Empire, Exxonmobile and American power are great reads on the power the oil majors weld.
Nothing committed in the shadows is holy.
Ever since TTIP came into light, it's been stated over and over again that it is PRO America. So this is no surprise. 
I always parse "TTiP" as an acronym for "This Is Thin Privilege."

As if the world wasn't weird enough already.
Why isn't this bigger news? This is unreal. 
kill all ceos. seriously. 
...and no one was surprised. 
I for one am SHOCKED!

Thanks Obama
This is the very definition of undemocratic
The amount of illegal bullshit in the TTP must be somewhat high. I hope there is a team of people going threw all of the pages. 
It is this way with all trade treaties must be somewhat high.
Thanks Obama
So how long until i absolutely need a vpn?
People will always try to take advantage of corrupt government bureaucrats, and some government bureaucrats will always be corrupt, so...
This is PERFECT! I'm currently working on a paper on the TTIP - couldn't be happier..
Im glad that corporations where given these strategies, its not like the public needs to know about them. 
Nobody expected big corpos to collude with EU officials. 
Oh, the scandal of going to the experts when they need expert advice.  I might faint.
I honestly don't even mind any sort of government spying on me.
If they wanna read the mails I send to my grandma, they're welcome to.
Wait, are you suggesting that TTIP is corrupt? Well, I never.
This is why we all need to form independent sustainable communities.
i have a simple solution.  VOTE FOR BERNIE
No shit. Why would any of that be public knowledge? 
Thanks Obama
The Sweetums Foundation?
Can you even imagine being a "coca cola health officer"? How do you even get yourself out of bed in the morning? 
Anyone that's used a treadmill that tracks calorie burning knows how little leading an active lifestyle really plays for weight loss. Eat less and avoid empty calories. 
Wait, so Coca Cola is bad for my heath?
Soda does not cause obesity, and neither does fast food. I've been eating nothing but McDonald's, Burger King and drinking nothing but Coca-Cola for ten years now and only weigh 400 pounds.
Why even pretend to be embarrassed.
I made no lifestyle changes aside from not drinking sugary drinks any more. I've been continuously losing weight ever since, pretty much my strategy is to actually check the ingredients and if they seem ridiculous I won't put them in my body. Not a difficult philosophy to live by.
This is why I take every modern study on diet with a sack of salt. Too much financial interest involved in the research to trust anything anyone says.
I know this is really naive, but I'm still shocked whenever I come to the realization that some people intentionnaly work for the specific purpose of giving other people a chronic disease.


Not in the "I'm just a gear in the machine and don't see the whole picture" way, but in a completely lucid and wilful way.
There is a [Center for Consumer Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Consumer_Freedom) that fights obesity 'myths', spreading misinformation that you can eat whatever you want and that exercise is a single factor in weight loss or gain.

&gt; The Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), formerly the Guest Choice Network, is an American non-profit entity founded by Richard Berman that lobbies on behalf of the fast food, meat, alcohol and tobacco industries.

&gt; CCF has attacked organizations including the Centers for Disease Control, Chipotle, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, The Humane Society of the United States, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine.

&gt; Acknowledged corporate donors to the CCF include **Coca-Cola**, Wendy's, Tyson Foods, Monsanto, and Pilgrim's Pride.

&gt; Berman's organizations have run numerous media campaigns on the issues of obesity, soda tax, smoking, cruelty to animals, mad cow disease, taxes, the national debt, drinking and driving, as well not increasing the minimum wage. He is hired by companies to attack consumer, safety and environmental groups.

I wonder how they are having a good sleep at night.
I guess the title is technically correct but the person, and Coke, isn't saying they're leaving because of the scandal. They're simply acting like they're retiring a few years early and had already made this decision separate from the controversy. Basically they're getting away with the whole thing. Coke even got their million dollars back from the University. 
Reminds me of 'That Sugar Film'. Really worth watching!
Junkfood/fastfood industry, Sociopaths run amok.
But who will ensure coca cola is healthy to drink? /s
Sugar is the new fat. People are catching on. 
Sugar is the true culprit of the epidemic. Oh how they are trying to cover it up!
Coca-cola had a health officer?
It saddens me deeply to hear of corrupt scientists.
Sugar in soda is what nicotine is to cigarettes.

It's 2015 and if you drink soda, you deserve what's coming.

Only problem is society, as always will take care of you. 
Listen I don't drink any type of fizzy drink because I don't see the point in drinking my calories when I could eat them, but the obesity crisis is caused entirely and 100% by peoples greed. Coca cola offer a product with the caloric information clearly printed on the back, if you choose to be a glutton and guzzle two liters of it a day without limiting your caloric intake in other areas, then it is **your** fault and no one else's. Everyone is always trying to look for someone, or even more so some big company, to blame these days for their own idiocy. Vineyards aren't responsible for alcoholics , the Afghans aren't responsible for heroin addicts and Coca Cola isn't responsible for your fat ass. 

EDIT: Also everyone knows Coca Cola is bad for you and can lead to you surpasing your caloric limit. Want to know who the real scumbags are? Companies who make juice and market it as some type of health food, or anything less than sugar water for that matter. There is 23% more calories in Apple juice than Coca Cola, yet it is perceived by the ignorant masses as healthy... so really which company there are the bad guys?

Honest question for Reddit:

Setup: There's some fairly blind faith in scientists across the board on this site. As if the stuff Reddit really gets behind can't possibly be tainted by scientists who are revealing "findings" which are in their best interest (like the guy from Coke).

Question: How do we really get to the truth of things if behind the scenes, the reality could be that scientists are angling for job security rather than genuine science?

Soda doesn't make people fat. Too much soda makes people fat. Take responsibility for your weight instead of blaming the manufacturers. They print everything you need to know right on the side of the bottle, drink at your own risk.
You are pretty dumb if you think soft drink wont contribute to being overweight though. 
Sugar is the new fat and persons are catching on.
Coca Cola has been here for over 100 years, it's not the main cause of obesity. People have a different diet than 30 years ago, that's the main problem. We used to drink cola as a treat, now it has replaced water, that's the real problem, not Coca Cola or any other soft drink.
Heath bars are just chocolate and sugar anyway, I don't see why they needed a heath officer in the first place... 
The amount of sugar and calories per can is insane. Like a king sized Hershey bar has less sugar in it than a can of Coke. I started slowly cutting out Sodas and drinking water/diet soda and now I mostly drink water. It's definitely made me feel better and the scale feels better too. It's really bad, I never looked into the actually calories, sugar etc of a soda but it is crazy.
And yet I will continue to guzzle cola like it's going out of style. Caffiene fuels me~
Well if the majority of people weren't such aimless tools, then this sort of ploy wouldn't work. But just like the "I'd like to teach the world to sing" campaign, people allow themselves to be suckered by the feels. Ten years ago I was in a place where I'd have been pissed at Coke. But now, people are so fucking stupid I have stopped feeling sorry for the victims. The nicer we make things the more useless people seem to get. And none of this even begins to speak to the delusion of HAES. Those people are desperately looking for any reason to engorge their pet schisms. Coke didn't need to enter the fray, truth told. That's where they went wrong. HAES sufferers are more than happy to oblige themselves and would have done so anyways.
This does not surprise me.

A lot of Redditors are too young to remember this, but the average serving size of a bottle of Coca-Cola was 8 oz. back as late as the mid-80s. Today, a single can is 12 oz. and contains 40 grams of sugar. That's nearly 1/10th of a pound. If you drink three cans of Coke a day (or pretty much any soda) you're drinking over a quarter pound of sugar. 

Robert Lustig recently did some interesting work on the physiological effects of sugar that are worth looking up. 
In other news corporations are evil.
Wait, Coke has a chief scientist and health officer? 
I'll never, never believe that cutesy, wise Warren  Buffet, sage of omaha, had anything to do with this. /s
For Science
Loading your coffee up with sugar will make tiny bottles of sugary soda that are low calorie!
if this affects them at all it would be by people boycotting coke, but most of them probably don't realize how wide spread the coke brand is.
I stopped drinking this soda crap years ago thankfully 
Well known fat fuck Kevin Smith apparently lost a shit-ton of weight just by avoiding foods with high amounts of sugar, barely exercising
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqca8F1DMf8
Mmmmmm...heath officer...gaaaaahhhghhhghhgghhghhg
In other news: Scientists found that grass is green.


Leaves? Leaves what 
ledger?
Dang an officer just for heath bars.
clearly a stealth ad for heath bars
Nobody mentions king coca cola s propoganda scientist in the whole thread.  There is your conspiracy
As always, capitalism is a beautiful sadistic thing.
So someone can go from 250 pounds and exercising daily for a marathon, more or less.
Unless you are in great shape and exercise 15 minutes exercise in the main-stream media, and falls - another simply pops up.
Heath officer? I love those candies!
Those fuckers.
[Heath Officer?](http://imgur.com/gallery/h1WtyEy)
It's so weird to think of how wholesome Coca-Cola seemed only a handful of years ago...and now this.

Weirder is that they didn't change--we all did.  And quickly.
I found one house where they are making coca cola mrinda pepsi and all types of beverage making. I think these types of beverge should be banned only registered companies should work.
Thus bleeds the scapegoat.
but did anything soda was healthy? really? come on.
[Sugar is addictive.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2235907/)
You'd think they'd hire a scapegoat to do such a shady thing, not their chief scientist 
From what I've seen and read on James Hill, he's done some [really awesome work](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BOojt1CbvF8), so it's a shame if he's involved with foul play. Many people support the idea that industry and research should be separate, but let's be realistic - they're not, and industry funds many aspects of science (think drug research). Personally, I support science being separate from industry and tend to place little emphasis on research which has industry backing. 

I would say that from reading this article here aren't too many facts which point out foul play. He's had a few emails with Coke; ok, could be a bit dodgy. I'd like to hear more if anyone has facts, but won't jump on the accusing/blaming wagon just yet, especially for such a renowned weight loss researcher.
No surprise that Coke produced slanted "research." How about Exxon and climate change? Tobacco? The bottom line is always the bottom line with business -- which is why strong regulation is essential for capitalism. 
* Big sugar company hires fake non-profit to downplay effects of sugar

* Big tobacco company hires fake non-profit to downplay effects of smoking

Personally i become a waiter so can earn money/train my legs and burn calories.Can say on   lunch  hour i burn the most.
"A spokesperson for Coca-Cola told The New York Times that Applebaum, aged 61, was retiring and had made the decision in October."

Riiiiiiight. That's like what happens when they fire a whistle-blower and they say that the person was fired for other reasons.
EDIT Goddamit, of course you can move around.
I did the math, and jogging an hour lets me eat half a kit kat. Except when I had jogged an hour, I felt like I had earned a double whopper and jumbo coke. Its why I never actually lost weight, despite exercising an hour or two a day for months. I had to actually start tracking calories to actually lose something.
Next year's news flash: "Rhona Applebaum dies from complications relating to diabetes"
Let's be honest, if someone today is *still* unsure whether or not coca-cola makes you gain weight if you drink it excessively..

They deserve to be given a lollipop and then have it forcefully taken away
I work in pharma.  Specifically a biochemist in QC.  It always upsets me to read stories like this.  Integrity should be you're number one priority as a scientist, not pleasing your shareholders.  
I think one of America's core problems is that public figures think it is OK to lie.

It spreads to everyone. A lot of the political trolls you bump into on forums like these feel no need at all to say things that are true.

My pet theory is that it comes from raising kids by letting them watch TV. People wring their hands about the violence, but the worst part is the ads, which are obvious lies. That's what American children have as role models, and it's destroying the country.
Coca Cola is poison for the body, nobody should drink this crap. If you need a quick sugar boost eat a piece of fruit, thirsty drink some water. If you have any regard for your own health stay away from processed foods in general. And just because you're not obese these processed foods are still really bad for you.
Exercise purely for weight loss.
I am sure if we continued digging into the relation of nutrition science and food companies, we would find very interesting things.
aspartame is worst 
Murica diabetus!
I realise this is a serious note, if you are heavier then you burn more bevause you are harder to move.
He was leaving anyway. This did nothing. He helped deceive millions of people for personal gain and nothing will be done. Even the way the article is written is a joke. People believe in official sources like they are from god. Fuck official sources. Its like listening to the president about a political scandal. This country is a bunch of retards.
If someone is regular-strong, and regular-low-bodyfat, BMI will be eating MORE, AND losing weight.
guess he didn't  want to spend the rest of his life selling sugared water
*Coca-Cola chief health officer falls on his sword

Does anyone really believe this was being done in some covert way?  He just gets to take the bullet for the company, and probably with a severance package larger than most of us will make in our lifetimes. 
Oh, here's a headline "large corporation uses money to influence others". (sarc)
Well at least they aren't a health officer! What does a Heath officer do?
But, but it's settled science. Scientists never say things just because it helps them keep their job. 
170 calories *per can* of Coke can contribute to obesity?  Oh my GAWD.

This isn't fucking rocket science.  Count your calories.  It's physics.  Fuck HAES.
Coca Cola containing sugar is not news; like tobacco, it's not branded as healthy and its ill effects are hardly secret. I'm more upset by the purveyors of the "healthy" sugary drinks--fruit juice--especially "part of a healthy breakfast" orange juice.
Look it up for your own sake, but for most of the food you eat as replenishment, instead of turning it into blubber.
We did it reddit!
Are those stash cans in the photo? It looks like the top comes off. 
They hate us cuz dia-beat-us.
I've worked in dental for the last 10 years and it still amazes me when I see how much damage daily pop drinking does to ones teeth. It slowly eats away at your enamel and causes rampant cavities. Drinking it in moderation is fine but I've met patients that drink nothing but pop all day, everyday and their teeth are in horrible shape and yet they still continue to drink it. 
Stopped drinking coke and in 210 days, lost 30.5 pounds without adding exercise. Brother in law works for coke and is a tool bag, so there's that.
You can't exercise yourself thin, you can't eat whatever you want diet.
A "no sugar drinks for 3 months" challenge should become for viral
im so glad i stopped drinking soda, it changed my life. lost a astounding 20 pounds in 3 months after cutting out soda. if your someone suffering from being overweight, dont feel bad ive been in your shoes. you can do it! 
Don't for a second act outraged.  This is what people with decent paying jobs at corporations do all day long.
I think coca cola should stop pretending and sell itself for what it realy is, an unhealthy as fuck drink that touches all the right spots in my tong.
The fall guy. How about we get the actual mofo who ordered him to do this.
Berman's organizations have run numerous media campaigns on the side of the story of exercise.
It's amazing how easily people sell out for their 30 silver pieces.
My name is Heath - I believe I am uniquely qualified for this position.... 
Serious question: when these things go down, is it normally the company telling them to do a shady thing then tossing them under the bus when it comes out. Or the company putting so much pressure on them to do their job they decide setting up fake non profits are the way to go?
Astroturfing at its finest.
They say exercise is more important, but isn't it like 70% diet and 30% exercise? Just take in an equal (or less) amount of calories to the amount you burn in a day..
Everybody complaining how everything makes them fat and I'm just sitting here unable to even gain 2kg no matter how much cola I drink or fast food I eat and I don't exercise. Never understood the people who blame coke and such for obesity. It's honestly 90% parenting and 10% what you eat/how much you exercise. I'm still all for a parental license.
Why isn't this deleted and put in the conspiracy section? 
&gt; Coca-Cola's chief 'scientist' and 'health' officer

FTFY
No Cola, No Life!
Man. This is how our would is. You honestly cant trust any product nowadays. 
They're being sacrificed, and getting a hefty paycheck to shut up about the fact that everyone in higher echelons knew about it.
Coca-Cola having a person in charge of creating drink addiction named "chief scientist" is like ISIS having a person in charge of planning suicide attacks named "chief planner".
Coke Zero for health!
Wait wasn't there the news that one of the top scientists at Coca Cola left because Coca Cola funded research that down played the correlation between obesity and Coca Cola?
On a meta level, this is what a free press is all about. Nice job on this one 
ITT: People arguing over diet advice, and no one seems to have any idea what they're talking about.
Shocking
I feel like letting your children drink any amount of soda or juice is pretty close to child abuse.  After taking our physiology into consideration, these beverages offer absolutely nothing but harm for our bodies.  Children need to be able to rationalize what they are doing before you let them slurp down a coke at McDonalds.  I don't think it is too far from allowing your children to smoke cigarettes.  It has no purpose and damages your body and is addictive.  We need to be labeling these things as DRUGS.  
It's too bad, because on paper - for that time period - it's a great way to gauge bodyfat, lean mass and bone density in every single movement you make will need to burn off a whatever you want to increase your figurative skepticism, make the grain smaller.
Just who exactly would drink more pop because a non-profit said "it's not quite as bad as we thought!" If you buy into that crap diabetes is the least of your problems.
It also increases your basic resting metabolic rate.
Everyone knows Coca-Cola is bad for you, but its delicious as shit and people will still drink it. 
As sad as this is, artificial sweeteners are not much better for you.  
Diet to get thin; exercise to get fit.
I was trying to fool people.
I saw a Coke truck the other day with the ParticipACTION written on the side of it. What a fucking joke.

For anyone who isn't Canadian, ParticipACTION is a non-profit organization originally launched as a Canadian government program in the 1970s, to promote healthy living and physical fitness. 

They had commercials all through my childhood about eating right and excercising.

Sad to see them sell out to coke, and sad to see coke try and pretend they are part of a healthy lifestyle. 
Well, the issue isn't sugar. It is a society that barely moves or does any form of exercise. Also it is due to a consumption mindset. 1st world country's eat for pleasure, not hunger.
Question, mostly people believe all soda like drinks and vitamin water drinks are bad for you.  So what is a business to do?  You can't sell just water.
Small fat at best. I doubt you're even oppressed at such a tiny weight. Eat a cheeseburger you anorexic skeleton. Real women have curves.
Keep on drinking that sweet sweet pop you dumb fucks.
I did the math, and jogging an hour or two a day seems to rev up the metabolism quite a distance to burn off a whatever you want Our representatives should be weight * h-2, according to an Oxford researcher.
He's just a scapegoat, as I would highly doubt he's doing this independently from the main governing body of Coca Cola. It's a shitty career yes, but this should be entirely focused on he he company not the scientist.
Why is anyone surprised about this? Enron did the same shit and see what is happening to our environment right now? 
It's unfair to blame food companies for people eating too much. A 355ml can only has 140 calories, which is nothing compared to most drinks. For comparison, 250ml of 2% milk is 130 calories.
Everything soft drink companies do is meticulously planned and over-analyzed.  

Ideally, the aim is for max profit, but the business model is old and crippled because their best customers (Large Format accounts) are so big that they heavily leverage their buying power which taps into the supplier's profitability.  These customers also cannibalize the significantly more profitable Direct-Store-Delivery of Small Format accounts.

Ex: That old guy who owns the pizza shop isn't gonna pay $7 for a 12pm of cans, he's gonna wait until they're $2.99 at Wal-Mart and load his pantry.  That per unit difference is make or break for these small business owners.

Therefore, soft drink companies off-set this profitability loss by pushing volume with aggressive feature pricing on key weeks with the benchmark of sales today vs 1 year ago.  Which is an annual longshot.  
So the marketing team will circle jerk innovative ways to get influence consumers to drink more because it is a consumable product... and   when people drink more, they become fat.  Essentially, it is a business strategy for them that is designed to combat these financial hinderances with volume growth... and the obvious consequence of that is growth... in sales, fat cells, and probably cancer cells.

Not to be outdone are the National Syrup Sales, who are likely the biggest contributor to the epidemic.  The fast food joints who sell high calorie drinks to wash down high calorie meals.  In order to obtain these accounts, soft drink companies often have to flat-out buy-out the franchise, or negotiate less than stellar deals - but the volume growth is there so they do it.  Major league capitalism.

I have very-very tight ties with the Pepsi franchise.  The people I work with do not drink Pepsi.  The corporate d-bags I've entertained, do not drink Pepsi.  They get Aquafina and they ask for it by name because their favourite card to play is the "Freedom of Choice" card which is essentially a position that the consumers are ultimately responsible for what they consume... And they are not wrong, they're just assholes.

But I have to say that to put the onus on one man despite his being employed in a position of social responsibility is corporate and industry scapegoating.  I doubt it was the man's idea and he was likely put up to it.  That, or he got the idea from someone else who's doing something similar.  Probably cigarettes as the soft drink industry is approaching a similar fate in the product's life cycle.  Decline and demonization... sweet sweet demonization.  

"The White Man's Poison" is a phrase I heard from a diabetic who was purchasing several 2 litres at the grocery store and I think it pretty much encapsulates the role of sugary drinks in the obesity epidemic.   
There's nothing wrong in a company funding scientists to test their products.

The problem is when the funding is not declared.

e.g. you may find on several scientific publications regarding aspartame "this work was funded with money from Tale &amp; Lyle"

The problem happens when scientist deliberately alter the results to make the funder happy.

Or if the funding is not declared.
Soda drinks are all garbage, in my opinion.
&gt;leaveson himself, not because of being sued by everyone and stomped into mud

This world lacks justice. 
top kek
apparently, "scientist" and "officer" are now synonyms to "PR manager" AKA bullshit dispenser.
At very least switch back to cane sugar..

Firstly, it tastes better, especially in Rum &amp; Coke.

Secondly, as far as I can tell from my armchair, fructose might not be the best thing to be consuming in the quantities that we do.

When I was a kid, I realized that if I am eating but want to eat more,  just chug 500ml of pop and the burp will 'make room'

Then I found out when you give fructose to animals, they lose their ability to control their appetite, they eat more, and they exercise less. 

...So, yeah. I drink a lot of lemon water and tea now.
I would want to downplay that too.....
"health officer".  I guess they canned him after the corn syrup thyroid controversy. Makes me wonder if Syngenta corn goes to Coca-Cola's high fructose corn syrup.  Bring back sugar plants in your sugary drinks, dammit.
Coca Cola, now available in regular and type 2
The leading role in obesity is a combination of stupidity and laziness. 
What an age we live in, where if you are dumb enough to eat yourself to obesity or too lazy to get up off your ass..... society will hold your hand through life until the fire dept needs to remove the side of your house to bury you.

[deleted]
Pretty sure it's the buying and consuming these sugary drinks that are causing the problem...
Yes, sugary drinks and forks are the reason for obesity. 
Sugar-filled drinks do not cause obesity. I live on them, am toothless, and over 35 pounds UNDERWEIGHT.

Gluttony is the cause of obesity, nothing else.
I love the way the Left thinks science is great until it is conducted by a private entity. It's as if they think the government never lies to them, and only pays the most virtuous scientists who just happen to come up with politically correct results. It is funny.
This sounds like something Sweetums would do
I've lost tons of eating and snacks.
But why male models?
This isn't news to me. I worked on their main propaganda website:  
  
http://www.beverageinstitute.org/
Sugar is toxic
Know what happened why I was training a lot and decided to stop drinking soda too?  Lost 25-30 pounds in two months. I thinned the f. Up. Soda, in my experience, was an important factor( I had at least 3 cans a day)
Introducing the new, all natural, all American liquid diet that sheds the lbs without pesky exercise.  That's rite American, today we introduce this revolutionary, scientist and Pope approved new life changing diet.  The "Coke Choke" is unlike any diet you may have tried in the past.  It uses our very own patented two step system that will have you thin and fit in no time.  Simply drink 24 cans of the Coke product of your choice each and every day and whatch as the miracle of Coca Cola forever changes your life in glorious new ways...
He didn't resign because of what he did.  
He was forced to resign because he got *caught* doing it.

"scientist"
I like Pepsi!!!
The only thing wrong with soda is that its just empty calories. Provided you eat relatively healthily, get your vitamins and nutrients, cans of soda aren't going to kill you as long as you aren't eating and drinking more calories than you're burning.

I just don't understand why everyone can't understand that.
Water is wet.
Freedom of speech if you tell lies tell them to the minorities so they can get fat and die off
Good thing I stay away from filthy poison like this.
Coke isn't the problem... It's you! 

Also, watch Slingshot on Netflix. 

Coke/Dean Kamen are leading the way to bring clean water to remote villages. Coke is doing more to get water to people in need than all of Reddit does...sitting in their mom's basement quacking like ducks.   

No, I done work or drink Coke.

Don't drink that Big Gulp Coke twice a day you fat Reddit geek.
At my gym a lot of calories, so now your threshhold for gaining weight is in the information that I've read so far the threshold for gaining weight is like 2500-3000 calories.
The amount of propaganda I see from the 16 hours of exercising, but hey, I could eat whatever I want when I'm backpacking.
So it's world news that a man that works for a company tried to downplay the negative impact that company's product can have on people? Apparently nothing important is happening in the world.
You gotta think it wasn't his idea. I'm sure there were higher-ups that made it a job risk that he's gotta hide it or he's gone.
If r/worldnews isn't going to focus on issues that primarily affect the US, then this should be removed.
I used to work in a research lab that has received some funding from companies like this and can honestly say that neither the research nor the results were ever influenced by the sponsor. It's too bad that just because research is funded by a company like Coca Cola it is immediately discounted. If Coca Cola wasn't spending money on research, there's quite a lot of legit research projects that wouldn't have the funding to be done in the first place. Unfortunate, but true. 
So. Instead of discussing the fact that (yet again), a 'scientist' is caught lying... Reddit discusses how long to exercise so they can keep drinking Coke.. I just can't even. 

The religion of science is the most messed up religion, yet. 
Their tactics are no different than tobacco companies, and the should be fined in the sameways tobacco were in the 1990's.
Fructose is poison.
Sugar is poison 
Obesity epidemic lmao Stop blaming sugary waters and evil coca poison brewers.

Just take care of yourself. It's fucking as easy as just eating moderately.
More than just being wrong, it's just plain stupid.

A better and correct plan would be to fight the bullshit surrounding artificial sweeteners.
nice to see some plain old evil in world that does not end in immediate genocide ..........
I am sure it was cokes idea 

They cant continue like this there have to be limits.

So how long until this amoral character winds up getting another job at some high paying corporate gig?
Keep drinking soda people, nothing wrong here.
Well if that wasn't a dead giveaway. Like no shit excess sugar is bad for you...
Aaaand they retire with a golden parachutes and r/fatpeoplehate wins again!
I am genuinely interested to see how this story will play out in the future. The Spanish constitution prohibits any regions from breaking away from Spain, so I want to see what will the Catalan parliament do about it. Will they just show a middle finger and say "Screw the constitution"? 

Also, "the centre-right government of Spanish premier Mariano Rajoy, facing a general election in December, has said it will immediately seek to block the resolution in the courts."

It'll ~~genuinely~~ be interesting to watch..
They really should have created Hispania to strengthen their de jure claim then they wouldn't be having this problem.
GDP of Spain is about 1.3 trillion. GDP of Catalonia is about 255 billion. It's a huge chunk of the Spanish economy and I bet the Spanish government will do just about anything to keep is part of Spain and keep the revenue flowing. Spain is in bad shape as is, so an actual sessesion would cause a full economic collapse. There's no way this will happen without violence.
Spain is never going to allow the secession constitutionally. Which leaves Catalonia doing it unilaterally, worst case scenario, Spain is perfectly able to send in the national guard. Even if this doesn't happen Spain is going to pressure the UN and the EU (no euro either).  Catalonia would not be recognized, let alone allowed into the EU. Spain could place an embargo or screw with them in many other ways. I don't know how France would play along in this scenario.

This is a lot of hypotheticals but I don't really see any scenario with a good outcome for Catalonia. I could be wrong and they split peacefully, but Spain's attitude up to this moment suggests that this is unlikely. 
As long as it lets me convince my wife that we need a new National Geographic Atlas of the World, I'm for it.  She won't let me replace mine just because there is now a "South Sudan" -- I need *two* new countries.
I am curious How it will end. In today's world it is more and more difficult to secede from a country, loans, paychecks, healthcare, social benefits, unemployment money, retirement money, everything is centralized in huge softwares.. Moving everything to a new system must be such a nightmare.. 

It's not just "hey we are independent now !", people must consider the tremendous efforts it will take to rebuild a government and all the tools that seems like granted but were developed and financed by decenies of taxes.. 

+People should be aware that leaving a somewhat stable country and form a new one will most likely have as consequences less trust from foreign investors, foreign companies and worst rates on pretty much everything : Loans etc.. 
Obviously, there are plenty of other aspects of a Catalan secession, but I'm really interested to know if La Liga would remove any Catalan teams from the league as a result. That would be a massive curve ball to Barcelona, particularly (meh, espan-lol fc).

Also, worth noting that the vote was 72-63 in favor of secession. I would kind of hope that a decision of this significance would have more in favor than 53%.
Can anyone weigh in on why the Catalonia region of Spain feels the need to secede? 
Stephen Maturin rejoices!
If they did secede, would Catalan be a part of the European Union or would they have to apply to become part?
It must be Monday.  I initially read this as "Canadian parliament votes to secede from Spain ..."


Voting for it in parliament doesn't mean it's actually going to happen. It's going to be interesting none the less. 
Perspective of a Castillian spaniard: This vote passed the Catalonian parliament 72-63. That is, in the bastion of support of the separatist movement, this vote squeaked out a majority only after one party voted as a bloc. The political reality is, it would be very difficult and costly for Catalonia to secede even if 95% of the population was enthusiastically on board with the idea. But if just 53% of MPs could bring themselves to vote for it *in their own regional parliament* then it borders on the impossible to implement such a drastic change in the medium to long term.

The separatist movement should think hard about what would actually be best for its own people. The EU has indicated Catalonia will have to go through the EU application process just like any other country. They will lose a tremendous amount of money every year until trade agreements are restored, and since Catalonia's biggest trading partner is the rest of Spain, it doesn't bode well for their economy. Spain will be the country least inclined to trade with Catalonia, with the most to gain from Catalonia's failure.

EDIT: Another reason why this is dead in the water-- pretty much every EU country has a separatist movement in it. The respective EU governments are loath to show support to one nation's separatist movement, out of fear it will legitimize the one within their own borders. If you're making a new country, the first thing you need are other countries to recognize you exist. Many of Catalonia's neighbors will be hesitant to do so for what it means for their own national borders.

Settlers of Catalan
So whats the plan of Catalonia? Feeding thier bellys with national pride? 

They have no plan for what comes after. Right now, they have a huge part of spains GDP, yes, but how much will be left after every fucking global company takes his 'spanish' HQ from (mostly) Barcelona to Mardrid? They want and need a spain HQ. Not a Catalan HQ "out of EU" with 1000 / 4000+ employees. 
Currency? 
EU? 
public sector entities? 

There is so, so much raw emotion and pride sidens the catalans, but so so less foresight. 
But what will happen to Messi?
Man, countries are like chicks, they are totally onto you when you own 1/3rd of the world and have so much gold your economy implodes, but as soon as you find yourself in a tough spot without a job and surrounded by rivals who are doing much better than you, they all go ''I think we should take some time off'' and shit.
[deleted]
I think that if they decide to leave, they won't care what (now another  country) Spain's court, parliament, laws, constitution etc has to say about it.

Why would they particularly do? I mean they would try to be as nice as possible but if they are independent, they can act as they like with the (economical) power they have.

Which make me think that in said situation, they'd try to not make big waves, but I don't think Spain would either as it would just hurt both economies more.
California! It's time so secede! Now's our chance! 
This reminds me of recent claims that Hawaii intends to secede from the U.S. In both cases, I understand why they would want to form their own state, but being that they're so small, won't it cripple their economies? I know Spain's economy isn't in great shape anyway, but it's still better than one tiny section trying to be self-sufficient, right?
The same user is submitting tons of click bait from this same source.

C'mon Reddit....let's keep some quality on /r/worldnews
Castile receives the "Restoration of Union" casus belli for 5 years. 
I wrote my senior thesis on secession and I have such a boner right now. 
See, Scotland? Catalonia can do it. Why can't you?
As a catalan I am fucking scared. I've assisted so many meetings from CUP (the radical ones) and they won't accept nothing but independence, that means it does no matter how much pressure Mariano Rajoy is trying to put in (also, he'll lose a lot of power on December's elections)
I have a feeling that Catalonia would regret this decision.
Self-determination is a human right. I really hope Spain allows a real referendum and recognizes the result. The UK handled the Scotland independence debate perfectly and I really hope everywhere else follows suit. 
They get it before Scotland? Dammit, we had a headstart and everything.
That's what happens when you don't core. 
This is post-modern warfare.
So much for strength in numbers.  Balkanization only works when you don't have an outside enemy to defend against and someone else is willing to bail you out in the event of a disaster.
Crimea, Donetsk, Donbass, South Ossetia, Kosovo, Catalunya.

Next year, Texas.
Spain will be done for if their best major city is fucking *Madrid*.
Would this mean FC Barcelona would be out of La Liga? :O
Real Madrid: Spanish champions 2017 - end of time
so does this mean it will actually leave by 2017 or its all a bit of a fake?
Good Luck Catalan! I hope you get your freedom!
They've already had so many public votes and they never get more than 30% of the population to vote for a yes to seceding.

Is there people that want to secede? Yes. Enough people to do it on a democratic way? No so far.

It'd be wonderful if those who want to secede just went and bought an island and leave the rest of us alone. There's still a huge economical crisis in Spain and this time and money should rather be spent on fixing real problems.
What are the glaring cultural differences that make the Catlanese (is that that the right word?) want to secede? Why do they feel that they need their own country? Not to say that they don't deserve one, I was just wondering why.

Quebec watches with extreme interest...
Expect to see more secession and Balkanization all around the world in the next decade or two. 
South Carolinian here. Just a heads up, this didn't go so well for us.
As a spaniard, I hope they succeed.
Won't happen. El Clasico is too important. Once again, football saving lives.
The Eu will never allow the rest of Spain to wage a civil war against Catalonia if they want to break away. Rajoy doesn't have any real options if Catalonia says screw you. If he deploys the military or police to crush the Catalans he will face heavy sanctions.
But where will they settle?
At least, you got to admit, it is refreshing to see people gathering their balls and re-applying them to the world.
How would the creation of Catalonia effect Andorra's relation with Spain, since they will no longer border each other?
ELI5 why all these Europeans want to fragment themselves even further when it doesn't seem like it benefits anybody. Is it some sort of weird pride thing? 
The main argument from people who are against this really perplexes me.

If you think they don't have a mandate, based on the election results recently, then why do you mind if they have a referrendum on it? If you are sure the people don't want it, then let them have the referrendum, it will be defeated and ye can go forward from there. If they hold a ref, and choose to leave, then that is the democratic will of the people.

It is quite clear to me, that those who don't want catalonia to leave are hiding behind political process in order to stifle democratic will. This thing about it being in the constitution, as if it is some kind of sacred cow is just an excuse. Countries ammend their constitutions on a regular basis. The constitution was also written at the time after a long bout of facist rule, so the reflection of todays way of thinking is somewhat skewed.

People in Europe like to espouse that they love democracy and free will, yet when it comes to it, they will try their very best to prevent it, if it means they stand to lose out form it. It is pretty hypocritical and morally reprihensible.
On the last elections (that were supposed to be elections to vote for or against independence with a 75% turnout record), the **majority of voters voted parties that are against independence**: 

**Parties pro-independence: 47.8%**

* **JuntsxSí**: 39.59% (Made by an extreme-left party ([ERC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Left_of_Catalonia)) and Right-Wing party ([CIU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_and_Union)), which has been involved in a 3.300 million Euros corruption case lately (Look up [Jordi Pujol - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Pujol_i_Soley)). The members of the JuntsxSí party are [currently being legitimately investigated for a multi-million euro corruption case.](http://spanishnewstoday.com/politicians-and-businessmen-arrested-in-catalan-corruption-searches_34843-a.html). Find [More](http://www.catalannewsagency.com/society-science/item/spanish-police-search-15-residences-offices-and-companies-linked-to-former-president-pujol-s-family) here.
* **CUP**: 8.21% (This party is an anarchist, anti-capitalist party, which does not side with CiU but is Pro-independence).

**Parties against independence total: 50.56%** 

* **Ciudadanos**: 17.90%
* **PSOE**: 12.72%
* **PP**: 8.49%
* **UDC**: 2.51%
* **Catalunya Sí que es Pot**: 8.94% (Party against independence, but pro-referendum, but **[against independence](http://www.publico.es/politica/pot-no-apoyara-declaracion-unilateral.html)**). Themselves and their voters are against independence, but they are pro-democracy so they'd allow a referendum). Also, [the leader of the party saying he is against independence](http://www.lavanguardia.com/politica/20140605/54409646366/pablo-iglesias-independencia-catalunya.html).

[**Wikipedia link for the actual, unbiased results**](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elecciones_al_Parlamento_de_Catalu%C3%B1a_de_2015).

And yes, you've heard it right, the main ex-leader and "founder" of the CiU party (the one proposing independence), [has been shown to have stolen around 3.300 million euros, holding 2.400 million in Panama currently and 900 in Belice.](http://www.libertaddigital.com/espana/2015-11-01/los-pujol-tienen-exactamente-3300-millones-de-euros-de-momento-1276560527/). It was financed by granting construction work to companies that later donated to his cause/accounts, etc. 

All in all, the party asking for independence (with 39% of votes), is the party that has been involved in corruption throughout these past years. Until the courts discovered their corruption, they were against independence, including his current leader (the current proponent), [here he is saying he is against independence in 2002](http://www.elplural.com/2014/07/22/artur-mas-en-2002-el-concepto-de-independencia-lo-veo-anticuado-y-un-poco-oxidado/). 
Hope they succeed! Best thing we dutchies ever did was seceding from Spain
Yes, but what will happen to FC Barcelona??
I think it's fascinating watching portions of small-to-medium sized countries trying to break off from the rest of the country; meanwhile, globalization continues and more multi-national economic entities and ties are formed.  You are gaining influence in your "national" arena by making it smaller, but diluting your influence in the global economy by becoming 1 of 1,000 tiny countries rather than a significant part of 1 of 100 medium countries.  Yes, I just made up those numbers.  I am curious, but so far it has not risen to the level of researching the impact.  :P
As a Catalan, it surprises me anytime a post regarding this is made as most of the time the comment section is hostile towards independence, taking into account its usually left-leaning and libertarian views. Regardless of the possible outcomes of independence, what removes the right of the people of Catalonia to decide upon their future? Does a wife have to ask her husband for permission if she wants to leave him? Self determination is a human right, and regardless of whether you're in favor or against you should be in favor of the celebration of a referendum. 

Now, as a Catalan, I am in favor of independence because of many reasons, including but not limited to:

1.  I don't feel Spanish. I don't like it when people put me in the same group as Spanish people or apply the same stereotypes to me. No, we don't do flamenco or bullfighting in Barcelona.
1. I feel that my culture would be waaay better represented as a country and not as a region. We have [many interesting traditions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IZ7CaGNI6w) which I want other people in the world to see and enjoy, just as I do with theirs. 
1. The Spanish government is absolutely corrupt and structurally failing; I believe that after 30 years of trying to change that the best solution is to take a lifeboat off of the sinking ship. This might sound like a greedy argument but I believe that a change like this would make Spain want to change for the better.
1. Spanish officials have repeatedly mistreated us, tried to hurt our language and culture by words and by laws, and the best way to defend them is to have a separate country.
5. I feel that the only reason Spain doesn't want us to leave is because we have money. That by itself shows how unintegrated we feel in the Spanish union. 

I hope this can make this clearer and make our point better understood. 
In the last elections 55% of the people from Catalonia voted against secession. 
The thing is that the system is not 100% proportional, so 53% of the seats went to pro-independent parties.
**There is no precedent of a country breaking away from another with less than 50% of the people in favor.** This is just a joke.
Well maybe if they didn't make music that caused people to start mass murdering each other at weddings this wouldn't be a problem!
All hail the hipnotoad

What is Catalan? Went to Wikipedia, and I am now even more confused. Does it just mean northern Spain, or is it like a group of people thought out Europe. 
I'm just crossing fingers and hoping that there is no armed conflict. Though it's very unlikely, Spain has been peaceful since the fall of the dictatorship of Franco. One thing is clear, Catalonia is not gonna get done with this easily, with all laws and international and European pressure.  
Welcome Barça to Ligue 1!!!!!!
Sheesh! Everytime a country secedes, EVERYONE always state that the country will never make it.
Viva Catalonia!
For anyone who's interested like me as to why they want to secede...

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/11179914/Why-does-Catalonia-want-independence-from-Spain.html
This might have been done so Catalan can get off the Euro and devalue their own currency to stimulate the economy.   25% young adult unemployment for so many years is unacceptable.  Time for more local-level solutions because national governments are controlled by bankers
Would this affect Barcelona being apart of LIGA BBVA in 2017/2018?
I thought Catalan was conquered. Unlike say Scotland which entered into a union (to save themselves from bankruptcy and what not). This could lead to more regions breaking up. 
Can a Spaniard here explain to this American *why* this is happening? Is it like a Scotland thing where "We want to be independent because we were before"? I know Catalan used to be a kingdom of its own before the Reconquista but I have no idea what might be causing Catalan to act this way.
more of this pleeease
So what's next? Aragon splits off, Leon reappears, Galicia reappears, and the rest reverts to Castille? Let's reinstate Granada whilst we're at it :)
Can someone ELI5 what's going on in Spain? Why does Basque and Cantalan want to break apart? 
Scrolled by fast and read the headline as "Canadian Parliament votes to secede from Spain". I am not very smart. 
There is too much money in Catalan for spain to let it go.
Rajoy government, cheered be the EU can't drop the unemployed rate below the 20 points... that's..... lame. 
TIL Catalan exists. I wish Reddit would up vote more universally relevant news. 
Spain is in bad shape as is, so an actual majority approve of it.
No need to be the bitch during a time when you cant just invade a country and annex it. 
Perspective of a Castillian spaniard: This vote passed the Catalonian parliament 72-63. That is, in the bastion of support of the separatist movement, this vote squeaked out a majority only after one party voted as a bloc.

Woah it looks like its actually happening and this is really fucking neat. I wonder how this will play out, it may just be a clusterfuck.
ARE YOU PAYING ATTENTION SCOTLAND? 
Can California do this too? Tired of paying more to federal government than we get. Let the south pay for their own welfare from Texas.
The politics of identity, rather than economic logic, seems to propel secessionary movements across Europe. There are three phases: a sense of being disadvantaged by a remote elite, a groping around for an identity that excludes that elite and finally a drive to separate altogether. 

It's that first step that seems to be critical. Trouble is, feelings of this sort are seldom due to the reality of a remote elite, and much more to do with a sense of local inferiority. Separation won't help with that.  
I remember hearing that a lot of no voters simply refused to vote. Seems like this catalan government is so obsessed with independence they're simply going full steam ahead regardless of what those who disagree with them think. 
Initially, I read Catalan as "Catan", and I thought, " They should be alright, as long as they can get a favourable amount of wood for their sheep ".
If Catalan Region breaks away successfully, it will set off a precedence for many similar such regions to break off both in Europe and the World. In theory, I do support nation-states, that is states based on a specific ethnic groups, rather than states that artificially try to bring together different ethnicities into one identity. (This works in the New World, but not so much East of the Atlantic). Such break away states must have a clear justification for their secession, as in the end of the day, people have the right to choose who they are governed by. 
Spaniard here. In my opinion they should have waited after December's elections, at least. The current government of PP (2011-? and the previous times the same party has governed, 1996-2004) basically rejects even to talk about the issue with the Catalonian government. It's a bit like "if we don't talk about this, it doesn't exist, and since we won by absolute majority we can even disallow any debates about this in the parlament". 

The previous government of Zapatero (PSOE, 2004-2011) was a little more open to talk, and even promised to push a reform of the catalan's autonomous statute along the lines of whatever was voted in the catalonian parlament. But that draft was rejected by our constitutional tribunal. The problem is, that tribunal is formed by members choosen by the two biggest parties (PP and PSOE), with a majority of them at that moment having been placed by the PP in their previous government, so while their opinion might hold some water... shouldn't be final. They tend to align with "their" parties a lot of times.

Also, there are several parties that are open to start talks or even to reform the constitution to allow a referendum, and I think that would be the right way to do this. Several of them also want to rebuild the constitutional tribunal so judges are the ones who vote each other instead of being placed by the parties. These parties will probably not win the elections, but they have enough support to guarantee that any government that comes after December's elections will need to negotiate a lot with them (I hope so).

Lots of people think that if they were allowed to do a referendum when they really asked for it, the result would have been a deep blow for nationalists. But the current government's insistence in "that's illegal, and we COULD do anything allowed by the constitution to prevent it (hint, we have tanks and you don't and we could just jail your president and all of his team)" is only helping the nationalist cause. Today, even lots of non nationalistic catalans say "I want to vote NO, but I want to have the right to vote that". That was unthinkable 5 years ago, and it's mostly because of the absolute negationist position of the current government.

Also I think most of this is a smoke curtain to hide the deep corruption in both governing parties, Spain's PP and Catalonia's Convergencia. Both parties have lots of members with swiss bank accounts and lots of fraudulent operations (even their most historical figures), both had their treasurers jailed, both had several of their offices paid with black money... I could go on for hours on this but my English is not that good with legal jargon.

And while Convergencia always "trolled" with the independence part, they never really fought for it, they only used it historically to make pressure to get more money. Once they obtained it, it was a non issue again. If I were a nationalist, these guys would be the ones I would trust the less. The CUP (another nationalist party) is a lot more open about their intentions, even if they are proud to be radical anti capitalist I would trust them more because they are open about their intentions of "fuck the EU, we have to build the Europe of the people, not the Europe of the banks, even if it will be hard at first".
I hope Catalonia gets their independence. Spain should stop getting it the way and accept it. 

I know Catalonia is one of the highest GDP areas of spain which is why Spain Is fighting so hard to keep them
Once they do, they will be known as the Settlers of Catalan!!

I wonder if they have wood!
United we stand divided we fall
Jesus Europe, you guys really can't hold it together.  
   
Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Baltic States, you guys are fragmenting left and right.  
This is so cool. My great Grandfather is Juan Bardina, from Catalonia. He was born in the late 1800's (Edit: IN CATALONIA) and has always been a proponent for the succession of Catalonia, as well as equal opportunity for education between sexes and Religious neutrality. He was essentially exiled from Spain by the Nazis after co-conspiring with other anti-war German intellectuals. He fled to Chile, had my Grandmother.. and now I'm here. 

I'm not sure if this succession makes a lot of sense nowadays, but it would be amazing to see my Great Grandfathers' life work come to fruition. If anyone has any questions the similarities between me and my G-grandfathers ideologies are SO eerily similar. He was into education, the natural development of adolescents, and MMA (LOL). He even wrote a book on which fighting styles were the most practical in a street fight. They were the same three styles I've been saying were the most effective for the last 7-8 years. I just learned about this book today.
Some information:

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUGhn06ij0o) you have a "long story short" video explaining the background. 

Since the day the video was done, two things have happened:

* Catalonia celebrated a non-official [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_self-determination_referendum,_2014) two days later. The yes won. 
* Last September, Catalonia celebrated [official elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonian_parliamentary_election,_2015) specially focused on this issue and the independence parties obtained an absolute majority. 

More:

* Today the Catalan parliament just made a symbolic start of the independence process, not executed the process itself (it's complicated, I know). That is something that will go on slowly for the next two years to prevent a big clash or too much tension.

* The common view in Catalonia is that Catalan nationalists have tried it all to negociate with the rest of Spain and get a referendum or better autonomy. Spain has always said no to everything and the time has arrived to go forward.

* Catalan nationalism is an open, politically plural and proEurope one. It is multicultural and non-agressive. It is very different from other big nationalisms in Europe.

Well, we'll see what happens now!
I read this as Canadian parliament votes to secede from Spain by 2017. I think I might be dyslexic, or retarded. 
So, correct me or help guide my understanding here, but my tentative take on this is: "Rich snobby assholes want to get away from all those poors and working-class types holding them down, and form a nice little micro-country for rich snobby assholes only." 

Is that essentially it - a class argument - or has Spain at large genuinely mistreated Catalonia somehow?
WOOOHOOO! No more Barcelona in the spanish league.
What will happen toh LAliga then??? Will Barca will be separated??
I visited Span and Barcelona this last year and found the secession movement fascinating. So I have a question about the gravity of this vote.

The way I understood this situation was that there have been votes in the past to form a new country in Catalan that Spain refuses to allow.  The fact that the Catalan parliament voted to do this was big, but it has been done before without instigating much change.  Not only will Madrid not allow it, but it is more of an idealogical stance than a step forward, as it has been voted and passed before.  Am I wrong here?
*They burned the churches down in Harlem,*

*Like in that Spanish Civil War*
Forget about politics, the biggest concern here is how this will impact Spain's national team for the World Cup!
Do it. My country secede from spain long ago, things are better since then.
Seceders of Catalan.
It's the fucking Catalonian wine mixer!
It's the fucking Catalan Secession Wine Mixer!

Happy to see Catalonia (my country) here
Seceders of Catalan
Hoorah!

Strike a blow for self-determination!!

Next, the Basque Country!!
Mexico seceded from spain and did not collapse, cataluña could do it as well. 
Balls in your court, TEXAS!

I read that as Canadian Parliament and was very confused.
Does this mean that Barcelona won't be in La Liga anymore?
As a Basque, I'm hoping this succeeds and that we're next. 
As a Scot, I'm insanely jealous. Really hope everything goes well.
GOOD FOR THEM! Who the fuck wants a royal family that was reinstalled by a Fascist as their head of state?
It's ironic - reddit understands why a country would want to seceded and loves different cultures, yet is baffled and angered when people don't want so many immigrants going into Germany/Scandinavia. 
This is what happens when you runout of other people's money.  Eventually the group getting screwed the most will say FU and leave.

I think people have to really get something, that if you are going to share resources, you have to be mindful about the need to say no.  It is always politically beneficial to say yes to everyone, but saying yes to everyone's wants and desires will destroy that common resource.  

It is unfortunate that Spain will go through some pains to realize this, but it will be better off in the end.  Once the dependent regions learn to become self sufficient, they will have restructured themselves in a way that may pave a way for reunification later down the road.
Hopefully Scotland will be next. :)
Maybe this is a good way to get out of the EU.  Secessionist states just "leave."
we tried this in the states once, hopefully the Catalans do a better job of secession. 

eeeh? Wow. Visca, I guess. Good luck Spain and Catalunya... I don't think this will go smoothly.
Now for the second Spanish war of succession.
So, will Valencia province join Catalonia in this movement? Both provinces shares the same language, even though they calling it by different names (català and valencià)
Millions of people have died as part of succession in the past. And now, it's just a matter of taking a public vote and doing it. Humans have come a long way in some regards.
How about having Spain simply hold a referendum on independence in Catalonia? After all, if Spain will win this referendum, then this should get the Catalan separatists to at least largely shut up for at least the next couple of decades.
But what sort of armies can they field? I doubt their infantry can stand up to the Spainard's famous cavalry!
Could this lead to war? 
Spain still hasn't let go of Gibraltar, despite hundreds of years of British control. Spanish government will do everything it possibly can to keep strong control over it. 
Not without a Civil War, you won't!
Well it has been almost a hundred years, so a Spanish Civil War would be right on schedule
Throwing this out there: instead of a civil war, let's just have a 3 game fixture of Real Madrid v Barcelona
Reminds me of Taured.
God dammit, I don't want to see Barca in Ligue. 
war is coming
RIP FC Barcelona.
So which players will the Spanish national team lose?
what would this mean for FC barcelona? i have been following this team for sometime now (messi is the best player in the world).
They really should have created Hispania to strengthen their de jure claim then they wouldn't be having this problem.
Anyone have a map that would show the proposed separation of Spain and Catalan?
sounds like we got a civil war on our hands, boys!
Didn't even know Canada was in Spain!
Lol...companies are buying each other and merging while countries are seceding or splitting up
Would the new country be called Aragon?
I know new countries from what amounts to all the time, but this might be the biggest change from a Western perspective since the fall of the USSR assuming it goes through.
I wrote a paper about secession in a 3rd year law class yeras ago (got an A+!) that had some interesting and relevant research. 

In order to secede, 3 levels of secession law need to be in place:

1- State / Provincial.  In this case, Catalonia seems to have this.

2a- Federal.  In this case Spain does not recognize their desire to secede and has no legal framework to allow them to do so.

2b- International.  In instances where relevant Federal law doesn't exist or exists to deny the state secession rights, it becomes legal where the state can demonstrate a pattern of human rights violations imposed by the country on to the state.  

In this case there is no such case for sustained and prevalent human rights impositions from Spain onto Catalonia so they will not have the support of international law to overstep the federal laws and won't be able to legally secede. 

This has historically been done with success by Russian states and a few others, but most famously been 'teased' by the Quebec / Canada separatists.  They keep making votes to secede not realizing that even if they eventually did get a majority vote to separate that it wouldn't be legal on any level and wouldn't happen. 
Can anyone weigh in on why the Catalonia region of Spain feels the need to secede? 
Everyone is focused on how this will be bad for Spain, but what about Catalonia itself? Are they able to stand on their own legs economically and politically? And what support are they getting from the international community? 
*bling* Ah that was the microwave my popcorn is ready ~~~
par for the course
A lo mejor pueden unirse a Quebec. Good luck with that, guys! --signed: a spanish guy
FCB vs PSG = new El classico!
So if Catalan got their independence, how do they split the fleet of subs that won't float?
So now for a really important question:

Will Barcelona still be able to play in La Liga?
Nazis never die... 
Settlers of Catalan.
[But why](http://i.memeful.com/media/post/lMzzPmM_700wa_0.gif)
But, muh Real Madrid vs. Barcelona matches 
the important question is, does that mean FC Barcelona will still be a part of La Liga?
No more El Classico?
we let scotland have a vote/referendum.

Spain let the Catalan People vote on their future
Sweet! My great, great family is from Catalonia! 

I KNEW WE WERE ROGUE OPERATORS. 
So will Barcelona (FC) join Ligue 1?
The political parties supporting secession represent 48% of the catalans who voted. But due to the election system regions with little population give more deputies per person than more populated regions. This means that although secessionist are not majority they have the majority of deputies. Even in Canada (the only country at this moment accepting the possibility of secession of one of their regions), wouldn't accept less than 50% of the votes in order to declare secession. To declare secession with less than 50% of the population supporting it is a very dangerous move.
So why do they want to break away? are they unhappy with spanish government?
Remainder of Spain votes to rename itself Dogalan
Should get France to attack Aragon and release Calalonia in the peace deal
....eh, why can't they just occupy it good ole' Spanish way? They've done that in the past.
Will this affect el clasico?
I'm packing my bags for a nice long vacation in Spain. Gotta protect Catalonian comrades from evil west.
Where will they host the Spanish Grand Prix?
I tried to settle there once, but without any ore (and too many sheep), I wasn't able to win.
I read this as Canadian parliament at first, and wondered how truly out of touch with Canadian politics I was.
Inb4 civil war.
What??? I wonder what Podemos has to say about this. Defenitely the movement 11-M began something. Nevertheless, I'm really surprised to read this
Like hell you are!

*pulls out gun and shoots Catalan in the foot*
I'm not sure if this has been brought up or not, but Madrid is considering the election pretty much null and void and will refuse to let this happen.
So we could see a new country in the coming years? Catalan sounds close to Catan. Spain pls.
http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=C805ka3C20k
Interesting video about Catalonia and how it compares to other countries (mostly Spain) on GDP and defence capabilities.
The south will rise again!
This is kinda unfortunate. Spain won't let this happen, and it'll be used as an argument as to why governments in other countries shouldn't allow regions with different histories to have semi autonomous parliaments.
I'm surprised they haven't registered secessionar.cat (the [Catalonian top level domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.cat)).

Say goodbye to all that sweet ".cat" domain revenue Spain...
Everywhere you look on the globe people want to cling to their own clan whether it is geographic or religious or ethnic, no matter the genetic similarities.  We rank ourselves and others, something our brains have trouble escaping from the days we lived in cave clans or the open steppes. We were unsure that the other was friend or foe.
Hopefully the King will be able to keep that from happening, no matter what it takes.
I like how it says "Scotland". Not "Scottish port", "Scottish coast". Scotland. The entire fucking country.
No dash cam footage?
Is Scotland OK?
I enjoyed how many times they crammed in the "zero-tolerance policy" for drinking. Oh, also there's a bonded store of alcohol on board that they keep having to replenish. Did I mention there's a zero-tolerance policy for drinking?
Scotland was 10 times the legal limit at the time of the crash and is being held responsible. 
So he preferred his rum on the rocks?
What kind of Russian can't steer a ship after only half a liter of rum?

Breaking news: Russian drinks rum instead of vodka
&gt;“Although a radar watch alarm had sounded every 6 minutes, the somnolent officer was able to reset the alarm without leaving his chair,” the report noted.

He hit. The fucking. Snooze button. On a radar watch alarm. 

I love this guy. 
8 times the Russian alcohol limit? So legally dead in America


How do you "eight times over zero tolerance"?
What should they do with the drunken sailor?

Ear-lih-ay in the mornin'.
'Into Scotland'?

I'd like that to be a bit more specific. Its coastline is 6,160 miles.
I'll bet before he took over he said "Captain *Morgan's* at the helm tonight boys! WOOOO!" 
I basically love everything about this story. No one got hurt, either, which is the best part.
In my experience that's fairly normal in Scottish waters, so I applaud the Russian crew for adopting local culture so seamlessly. 

When I was a student, over on the other coast, I worked with the crew of a Dutch dredger &lt;name of vessel redacted to protect the guilty&gt;. We were listening to the radio one day, and heard them calling the coastguard and asking them to send out a launch to direct them to the dredge line. 

The coastguard operator seemed bemused. "You've got Decca. Why can't you navigate to the dredge line yourselves?" 

"None of us on the bridge is sober enough to use it."


I love now the title says "into Scotland" 

"So where did it crash into?"

"Scotland"

"Which part?" 

"All of it. All of the Scotland"
Putin can show off his cruise missiles and fancy planes but this is the Russia we know and love.
Oh Russia. Please don't ever change.
Secret nationalist conspiracy to physically seperate Scotland from britain
Well, a russian AND a sailor, that's double the alcoholic tradition!
[The drunken president of Russia almost getting ran over by a bus](https://youtu.be/v9YnDirqwT4?t=149)
Although they can drink vodka like it was water, the Russian liver has not yet evolved the ability to do the same with rum.
I hope Scotland has insurance.
"Vlad, alcohol store is almost gone!"
"Is no problem Ivan, drunken Scotland can surely spare some. Let us go ask."
This may be the best headline ever written
And all of the Scots were left scratching their heads and wondering how this motherfucker lost control of a ship after only having a single nightcap.
This is the Russia I admire. 
Hopefully he brought some Russian vodka as a parting gift to make it up to Scotland for this offense. The Scots should then send him home with Scotch whiskey, or perhaps some more rum, his apparent drink of choice, at least on this occasion.
By Russian standards, it's a full liter or you're a pussy.
Headline is such BS. Half a liter of rum is what a Russian sailor calls breakfast. This guy was just getting level. 
So as a former US sailor I have to say that I'm both impressed and a little sad that The Russians have out done us. 
Scotland was too sloshed to notice, really. But the [Poet Laureate of Govan](http://i.imgur.com/x8g06it.png) was nice enough to write a poem for the Russian sailor in question: 

    You'll notice by your scrapped ship    
    You've drunk too much, my son    
    For running aground your ship    
    against my shores you're gone.    

    I know you won't like it     
    And most likely are sick    
    But please don't blame me    
    It was Captain Morgan who did this trick.    

    By now, you'll realise that I'm very much aware    
    of anyone stupid enough to repeat this affair    
    So before you decide to neck any more litres per hour    
    Next time, believe me, I'll be coming at you drunker, at many more metres per hour. 
russian here. sounds right.
Half a litre??? Fuckin light weight...
The sailor was immediately given honorary Scottish citizenship.
Witnesses say whilst Scotland tried to get away to avoid the collision it's citizens voted to stay with England. When reached for comment after the accident England said "We appreciate the sacrifice Scotland made for the union and hope that they will find comfort in the knowledge that we will ensure their oil and gas reserves do not go wasted."
This is complete buffoonery!
How can there be just one guy driving a ship? Don't they have several guys on the bridge at any given time?
What do we do with a drunkin  sailor? What do we do with a drunkin  sailor? What do we do with a drunkin  sailor, early in the morning?  
Didn't a similar accident occur in February of this year for this *very same boat*? Link : http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-31545794

Looks like the sailor has always been inept.
justrussianthings
In Soviet Russia, you don't crash Scotland, *Scotland crashes you.*
Every Scotsman right now.

"Fucking Lightweight"
Scotland's response  "we understand"
LEEERROOOOOYYY JENKINOVONICH JENKINOVSKIY!!!!
If he drank he whole litre he might have crashed into earth. The earth.
The Russian Maritime Union should pull this guy's papers. Half a liter of alcohol (even if it was 151) is like a 3.2 beer to any self respecting Russian, much less a Russian sailor.
Captain: Bring me the horizon! 

*CRAAAAASH* 

Captain: You magnificent bastards! You didn't just bring me the horizon, you brought me a whole island! We have succeeded beyond me wildest dreams, men!
Crazy how that entire ship was built to withstand millions of gallons of water, and the worst storms. In the end, all it took was half a liter of rum to do her in. 
Y-A-A. . .  
Я-Р-Р-Р-Р!!!!!!!!!!
This headline just seems like bragging.
Well, now I don't feel so bad for fucking up the print merge at work and having to re-print and stuff all the envelopes. This guy totaled a cargo ship. For my annual review I'll write "Didn't crash a cargo ship into Scotland" under Accomplishments.
The only crime was that it was rum and not whiskey.
This is the most Russian post I've seen this month.
8 times the Russian alcohol limit? So legally dead in America


And this is how Dracula got into Scotland.
When I was a kid, my neighbor was a tuna boat captain.  He'd done some work on Russian commercial fishing ships, and he said those Russian fisherman were constantly drinking and fighting.  
Ruskies don't half-ass it.
Hunt for the drunk October 
In the Russian's defense, Scotland came out of nowhere and failed to signal its turn.
half an L isn't that much, especially not for a russian sailor.  Wonder what else was going on.
I'd love to hear this this guy's story at an AA meeting.

"My name Boris and I am alcoholic. If you think you bad, I hit bottom when ran ship into small island called Scotland. I then figured fuck it, and went to pub for scotch"
You ever been so drunk you crashed into a country?

Here are 13 Russians who could hold their alcohol better than that loser.

TIL - N.I. sells paper to Norway by the ship-load! 
Can someone please post the dashcam video?  It should be good.
Prepare for rumming speed!
Scottish reports were "Russian crashes ship after light breakfast"
Rum?  Would have thought vodka.
TIL Russians don't always drink vodka
Well of course he couldn't handle rum... he's Russian. If he'd had ten times that in Vodka, he'd still be good to go.
What a fucking lightweight 
Everyone loves Drunk Russians™.
The most Russian thing ever,
Alpha as fuck
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?
["We're a lighthouse, it's your call...."](http://www.snopes.com/military/lighthouse.asp)
I'm honestly surprised this is the first time it's happened.
me_irl
Should have stuck to vodka. 
The only questionable thing about this story is why it was run instead of vodka 
Wouldn't happen if he drank that much vodka. 
"Oh sure, when Johnny Dep drives a boat around all drunk on rum in a movie it's adorable, but when I do it I'm some kind of asshole.  This is such horseshit!"
Scotland should name a cocktail in his honour! 


Naturally it should come shaken not stirred, on the rocks! 
I read it as "7,000-ton ship full of speed," that would've been a very different headline
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH A DRUNKEN SAILOR.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH A DRUNKEN SAILOR....
&gt;Despite the DFDS company running a zero-tolerance policy for employees, the officer had managed to consume enough alcohol to make him eight times over the alcohol limit, the MailOnline reports.

Well, heck, 8 x 0 still equals 0 so he's ok!!

&gt;A DFDS spokesman said: "What happened on the ship was completely irresponsible. We have a very clear and very clearly communicated zero-tolerance alcohol policy which cannot be misunderstood.

&gt;"We have never seen an officer having violated the policy before and we have never before seen such negligence of our safety procedures.

Oh really?

&gt;But despite the zero tolerance policy, Lysblink Seaways carried a bonded store, which included a stock of spirits, beer and wine, the report stated.

&gt;“Records showed that the bonded store was regularly replenished, and empty beer, wine and spirit bottles and cartons found on board after the accident indicated significant levels of alcohol consumption by the crew.”

You mean to tell me this stock was regularly replenished but no one ever had an inkling the crew was stealing it all and drinking it?

I think there is a long chain of people, from the store, to the captain to the idiot who crashed the ship all handily covering their asses right now.
Wow I thought for sure this was from /r/subredditsimulator
This sounds like a very Russian sailor thing to do.
Yeah, Rum!!
R.I.P. Scotland. Never forget.
Och eits just a wee dent, we can buff it oot.
Russian sailor reported Scotland was drunk and rammed his ship at full speed.
Йо-хо-хо и бутылка рома!
"Carrying a cargo of paper" this seems like a side plot for an episode of the office - Michael meets a sailor that is leaving with a shipment of Dunder Mifflin paper, and he wants to buy him a gift. Because he's a sea faring man Dwight and Andy suggest that he buy him a bottle of rum befitting a man of his stature. 

The Russian, who as it turns out is leaving an AA meeting when Michael finds him is too embarrassed to not accept the gift succumbs to the power of his addiction three days into his journey and crashes the boat into Scotland. When confronted about buying the bottle Michael does a bad Scottish accent and lies about buying any alcohol saying he wouldn't even know where a liquor store is in Scranton. 
Did Scotland and the captain exchange insurance information? 
I think the real surprising news here is that the Russians choice of liquor was rum rather than vodka 
~tans a bottle of buckfast~ 



Come get me if you think yer fucking hard enough!

Eh. It's just a pint. With some more practice he'll be able to fully function on a gallon a day. 
Where were you when Scotland was kilt?

I was at home making puns when reddit calls

No?

Yes!

Roosha!  Ah'll piss awl ovah yar fookin couch fa thus!
Well of all the places to drunkenly crash in to the Scottish are one of the more understanding, only the Irish or Australian's could have been more understanding. Those are three groups who don't consider it worth drinking if nothing gets damaged. 
Half a liter, what the fuck was he having a bad day?
He was 4x times the legal limit, keep in mind this is either the international waters legal limit or Scotlands, not sure which is more.
Wait, lemme see if I got this right

Fucking lightweight! !!
Sums up everything I know about Russians - in a good way - and I have visited the country three times and loved it.  They tend not to give many fucks.

The world would be a poorer place without a story about a Russian sailor who couldn't avoid the whole of the UK when driving a very big ship and pissed.  

Which one of us hasn't had a breakdown in concentration and physical co-ordination when a little over the eight.  No-one got hurt, it's just a very funny story.
Isn't that kind of not impressive by eastern European drinking standards?
I do believe that the name of the captain was Morgan!
How do you say "Hey ya'll, watch this?" in Russian? 
"Sober Russian wrecks boat."
This headline just feels like a drunk joke waiting to happen.
What's the Russian equivalent of "Hey Y'all! Watch this!"?
Can I just say, I love the phrasing of the title.

'Kapitan, we are running aground!'

'Niet, we are going to ram Scotland!'
Just glad nobody was kilt
Coming from a subreddit that has recently been associated with the bad news of the world, this was a delight to see. 
By rum do you mean vodka?
ITT: People not making the distinction between company policy and the law and assuming that having alcohol onboard somehow violates a zero tolerance policy about being under the influence *on watch.*
LOL
Also pretty alarming are the "Read More" links listing all the other cargo ship wrecks I didn't hear about. 
"Seriously, who puts Scotland here?, fucking unsafe"
8 times over the legal limit, that's impressive
Scotland is always looking for a good scrap.
Hit 'er right in the aye laddie.
How shocking...


I would have expected vodka.
Russian, Scottlan, Rum? This is bullshit...
That's Russian-style parking for you.
Oh god.

Is Scotland okay?
This is the last time that Russia will allow Marko Raimius to captain one of their boats. I always had my suspicions about that Russian captain with the Scottish accent.
At least the front didn't fall off

For a Russian I guess he's a light weight. 
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A RUSSIAN SAILOR ER-LIAH IN THA MORNIN
This story is crap.
It was vodka.
And he was on the way in.
And is made King
I told Yuri to just stick with Vodka, but nooooooo.
This is such a Russian news story.
Only half a litre? he needed to get his tolerance up before he took to the seas.
No one got hurt, either, which is the most expensive alcohol around while this guy effectively traded in a can I couldn't stop laughing at that.
What do you do with a drunken sailor, what do you do with a drunken sailor?  

What do you do with a drunken sailor? 
Crash it in to Scotland. 
Sailors from a country known for its vodka drink enough rum to crash into a country known for its whisky.
B/S, half a liter is nothing, I drink that much while putting on clothes in the morning.
Headline is such BS. Half a liter of rum is what a Russian sailor calls breakfast. This guy was just getting level. 
Damnit, another russian invasion !
Half a liter is not that much for someone with any sort of built up tolerance. Certainly you would be drunk but not retard drunk / black out drunk.
Well if he was a big enough alcoholic to drink a half liter of rum while driving, which is 10 shots for the uninitiated, then he should be able to handle 10 shots of alcohol and still drive. What a lightweight
If he was drinking vodka, he would of been fine.
I like the math here: "The sailor was reportedly eight times over the limit, despite the company’s zero tolerance on alcohol policy".
Eight times zero is still zero (0)
What I'm surprised about is that's less than ten shots and a Russian sailor couldn't still captain a 7000 ton ship? 
Yo ho ho and a dead mans chest. Cyka blyat.
Man....the headline.  Lost it.

A half of liter of rum really isn't that much for an alcoholic.... thats like 9 shots
CYKA BLYAT IDI NAHUI RUSH B CYKA
Shoulda stuck to Vodka, comrade.
I would think it would take way more than half a liter of booze to get a Russian sailor drunk. 
When he gets back home..."only half litter? You are a disappointment comrade"
[Why is the rum gone?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JImcvtJzIK8)

Thought this was /r/SubredditSimulator for a second.
What kind of Russian can't handle half a liter of rum?

I've had more than that today, and I'm still drinking.  
As a bartender - who pours two ounce drinks for every mix drink I make - 7 1/2 drinks doesn't seem like that much for a "drunkin' sailor"........... Pussy
My father used to be a maritime chief engineer. Once they had a russian captain who would buy a as much vodka as he could at port, lock himself in his cabin, and wait till next port.
Is Scotland okay??
I hope Scotland survived

half a liter of rum isn't that much, its less than a fifth.
Well, shiver me timbers...
Scotland has a little captain in 'em!
A typical Russian sailor.
8x over the limit!? In California that's 0.64 BAC.  I thought you died around .4 BAC.  Most of Europe is .5 so that's .40 BAC which is pretty impressive!
I guess someone is now looking for a new job.
That's the Russian way of protesting the war in Iraq.
CHOOO CHOOOOOOO

Really must have been Russian if he was going at full speed. 
&gt;Mario Larouche, 46, suffers from pain stemming from a car accident; he was found in possession of the plants illegally after he tried unsuccessfully to get a medical marijuana prescription from his doctor. According to Le Droit, the crown counsel in his case requested he be jailed for 90 days and ordered to pay a $250 fine.
&gt;Chevalier dismissed that recommendation and said Larouche was the victim of a system that "does not give people access to a natural medicine that goes back centuries."  

Holy shit. Well I never...
&gt;A Quebec judge has called out Canada's "ridiculous" marijuana laws, noting that lawyers and others who work in the legal system are probably getting high themselves.


The judge said:

&gt;"I think it's time we look much more leniently [at] things that happen."


The article also said that Public Security Minister Lise Thériault said

&gt;public safety needs to be a priority when the new laws roll out.

I think the most noteworthy part of the article is at the end:

&gt;With taxes, Larouche was fined a grand total of $1.30.
[deleted]
The judge probably has 50 plants growing in his basement right now too.
Meanwhile (well, earlier this year) in Garden City, Kansas, a mother is arrested and had her 11 year old son taken away because the child was defending medical marijuana, and his mom's usage of it, in school one day. She was using the it [cannabis oil] for her Crohn's disease.

As long as alcohol is accepted,  Cannabis prohibition is completely ridiculous.
GG judge, 30 plants is a life sentence in some US states.
...Much to Ricky and Julian's relief. 
If Canada legalizes marijuana, it's gonna make the U.S. look even worse.
It's really nice being Canadian these days.

Erm, is no one seeing the drug offense on the record? This affects your life in a lot of ways, not being allowed in the U.S. ever again is one.
Judge:"Now pay up!"

Man: "But I don't have any change, I use my debit card"

Judge: "... Then go to the bank, it's 5 minutes awa-"

*Judge reaches into pocket*

Judge:"Here's your change, now pay up."

*Man looks at coin*

Man: "It's a toonie ($2) though, I can't take this, it's only a $1 fine."

Judge: "Just give it back to me."

Man: "But wouldn't that count as theft since I took money away from the state? Legalities and all?"

Judge: "Oh^for^gods^sake ... Does anyone here have a dollar?!"

Edit: Extra with credit going to /u/shorthanded

Man: "I was told that the fine was $1.30"

Judge: "Do I look like a cash register!!"

It's happening. It's actually happening. 
As much as I agree with the judge, how does this work with jurisprudence? Shouldn't the personal beliefs of a judge be left out of this?
I mean, I'm Dutch and live in Amsterdam so I'm all for legalized weed around the globe, but this seems odd.
Canada
[Sorry, I've already put my clown down.](http://i.imgur.com/MGt50mf.jpg)
Can we get a few of those judges south of the border please
As a Quebecer this story makes me proud that I live in such a progressive nation.

I hope Canada takes the world lead for Marijuana legalization and research. It is high time this prohibition ends.
That judge should be president - of America 
If I were him, I'd make the fine 4,20 just for the extra kick &gt;.&lt;

Could anyone remind me WHAT YEAR IT IS?
"...there can be no justice so long as laws are absolute. Even life itself is an exercise in exceptions." - Captain Picard

Marijuana, another way to feel tired and hungry (in case you're not a student already).
To everyone saying the judge overstepped his boundaries: He didn't. He determined the man was guilty but since there's no minimum penalty for pot possession he's allowed to punish as he sees fit up to the max penalty. He didn't 'make his own law' or do anything contrary to the law. He merely gave out a penalty he saw fit that was well within his rights to give out. 
"obsolete" implies they were once useful or necessary
Attaboy calice.
Sooo... This Canadian Judge basically just said "Fuck the Police"? 

That's so awesome.
This is cool. Just for comparison, my friend got fined like 30,000 euros in AMSTERDAM of all places for having around the same number of plants, perhaps 20 or so more tops.

From one of the world's leading ganja smoking nations,  this seems common sense.  We'll done judgie
Excellent. The judge seems to be very sensitive to community expectations and is prepared to treat the law with compassion.
"Judge iissues $1 fine for possessing 30 pot plants."

More Judges like this please!

Damn! Judge missed the opportunity to make the fine $4.20 !
Thank God, its been in the works for a long time just sometimes takes people who realize the greater truth and truly wish to help people with the power given to them by their constituents. Now the USA just needs to follow suite.... common people stand up for your right!
Québec, Weed, Top post! I'm very proud. 
God dammit Canada! Stop doing shit right!!!
Awaiiiiiiii l'Québec!  Vas-y mon pot!
Progressive thinking from a judge? What kind of a world do we live in where somebody isn't thrown in prison for half their life for drugs?
That judge be blazin'
Here in Canada *(pronounced [Qnada])* we don't have private prisons that pay judgest to imprison as many people as possible.
Meanwhile (well, earlier this year) in Garden City, Kansas, a mother is arrested and had her 11 year old son taken away because the child was defending medical marijuana, and his mom's usage of it, in school one day. She was using the it [cannabis oil] for her Crohn's disease.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2015/04/17/state-seizes-11-year-old-arrests-his-mother-after-he-defends-medical-marijuana-during-a-school-presentation/
Well the system kind-of works. 

* The Cops *did their job* enforcing the laws as is their duty. 

* The prosecution *did their job*

* The Judge *did his job* , exercised common sense and made the punishment fit the crime.


In the end I think this was handled FAR better than the example of that Kim Davis nut case. Rather than do her job she chose to ignore laws she doesn't like on "religious" (!) grounds. 
I think the judge missed the chance to fine him $4.20 or if the judge turned out to be an 8 story tall crustacean from the the Proterozoic era, tree fiddy.
Great day for Canada and therefore the world
Colorado here. Just got back from the dispensary. What did I miss?
Pay it off 5 cents at a time.
IM MOVING
This is justice.
What sickens me is that people have to pay taxes on fines. 
As a Canadian.. I am shocked. What do you mean 1.30$ What is this extra 0.17$?? Ahhh... Quebec.
Good guy judge, but doesn't obsolete imply that it was once well functioning? Cannabis has not changed and the laws have never been effective or warranted.
Ha Haaa!  Canada about to fucking crush it on the world stage.  Pay attention world, the canucks are about to show you how it's done

Not really complaining, just honestly curious, is the judge really allowed to be pushing his own agenda like that?
Should have fined him $4.20
The prosecution will only appeal to a *higher* court.

heh heh
It's clear weed is going the legal direction. Why not just fucking legalize it period??!
Judge was high, the real fine was 420
The judge realizes where the country's going and is Justin time.
Pay it off in pennies 
&gt; noting that lawyers and others who work in the legal system are probably getting high themselves

I'm pretty sure by "others" he means himself.
AYYYYYYYYYYYYY
So the suggested punishment by the crown counsel (which I assume is the public prosecution, please correct me Canadians) is 90 days jail time and a $250 dollar fine?

That's the punishment I would dream for, even beg for if I was caught with 30 plants in the US. God bless you Canada. 
/r/trees
*here's a loonie*
I would be in such a better place than I am right now if I could legally smoke pot. 
 Come on USA get with the program. 
One day they will look back at us and laugh at the drug laws
should have fined him 4.20$
Soo do you guys do payment plans?
I just wish that this attitude will eventually be extended to users of other drugs. I believe in self-ownership, and that people can do with their own bodies what they want. There are many users of other drugs than weed who are not addicts or who at least are not harming anybody else, and who should at least be treated no different from alcoholics or nicotine addicts: by offering them medical and psychological help, not punishing them. I think dealers who sell very addictive drugs like heroin or meth with the intention of getting people addicted are scumbags, and that should not be legal. The sale of such drugs should be prohibited or extremely regulated. But the *users* should not be punished. I think in 50 years or so, we will see that as one of history's greatest injustices and shake our heads at how society used to punish sick people with imprisonment. We'll see it as no different than alcohol prohibition; a measure to force a certain puritan morality on people under the guise of helping society, with no consideration for the fact that society is made up of individuals who do not deserve to be punished for doing something unhealthy to themselves.
Ricky and Julian at it again...
ITT: Americans complaining about America
Do you still have to pay the $400 court fee like you would in the US?
As long as alcohol is accepted,  Cannabis prohibition is completely ridiculous.
I'm actually for legalization, but judges shouldn't be deciding policy. 
Just to put this in context, Justin Trudeau was *just* named the Prime Minister of Canada and immediately issued an order that the judiciary begin preparing to legalize marijuana. The judge is doing the right thing, but this exists in a political climate where Canada already *knows* that marijuana is likely to be 100% legal for recreational use throughout the country within the year.
So we're totally down with judicial activism as long as it's to get away with something we approve of? Lol. This is the dumbest way to neuter prohibition i've seen. We're supposed to dismantle the written law itself, not the enforcement of it. 
Judge Canada cool guy gets it and were still locking up non-violent offenders for minor drug offenses because you know, profits.
Playing Devil's advocate here.

I genuinely think it's bad that judges are taking it upon themselves to determine whether or not laws are ridiculous or not. To put such legislative power in the hands of the justice system goes against Montesquieu's Trias Politica, the foundation of most western nations' system of government.

I'm also a little drunk, so please excuse amy grammatical or spelling errors.
I bet that arresting officer was pissed. Haha
I know this is going against the grain here, but are judges allowed to basically bypass laws like that? I smoke, and I agree that the laws are archaic, but why is this one man allowed to basically nullify a law's enforcement based on political opinions? Is it legal in Canada for this to happen in a more serious situation?
Throwing humans in cages and stealing their property for cultivating flowers is insane.
I'm all for legalisation but isn't this kinda like the thing with that Kim lady who wouldn't issue marriage licences to gay people?  As a judge you need to uphold the law not your personal beliefs 
Wow I need to stop moping because we keep putting all of her possessions including her house seized by the government and probably be subject to sniffer dogs at train stations and suffer severe penalties for small amounts.
Reminds me a jury trial I sat in on regarding a DUI of marijuana in LA.

The young man was pulled over for a broken tail light. The cop mentions he was driving perfectly otherwise. Upon pulling the man over and coming to the driver side window, he noted the smell of marijuana and saw a "smoking" roach in the ashtray. The officer proceeded to run him through a battery of tests, (touch your nose with your finger, walk a line, blah blah blah) and noted signs of intoxication, and then booked him as a result. Blood toxicology notes that the man had THC in his blood (or the other stuff they're measuring, I forget) but were not able to tell when he had last smoked except "within the last 30 days."

The judge reminded us that this was a DUI incident, not a judgement about the legality of marijuana itself.

We had a hung jury, (I don't know the details to that, I was an alternate) and so the man got to walk scott free.

The smallest and silliest of crimes, and myself, and dozens of other people had to give up our jobs for two weeks to listen to this ridiculousness.

If the man was guilty, who knows what kind of jail time and ruination we were going to throw this young adult into. But even though he got to walk, the state of California still lost at least ~$50K of economic input due to our having to preside over this.


that's quite refreshing to hear - great job again Canada!
Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear gowns. 
As great as this may seem at first glance, I find it very worrying that a judge thinks he gets to decide which laws should be upheld. That's not his job. There's a thing called separation of power, and it's there for good reason.
[deleted]
Funny how a judge violating the hell out of the written sentencing guidelines is ok when we like the result... Can you imagine a judge making an equally-legal but incredibly strict decision?
[deleted]
yay
I would have a joint with this judge. 
A little steep, that's going to eat into munchies money. 
\&gt; Implying the laws weren't already obsolete at the time they were proposed.
What the hell? 30% added tax on a fine? What tax is that?
Isn't it legal to own a certain number of plants for personal use in Canada?
I do think the Weed laws as well as most drug laws are in need of
and update. The problem is who does the updating ?
way to fuckin go, eh!
Thirty per cent taxes? Now that's harsh. 
People are going to look back on all this Marijuana law prosecution crap and wonder why it was ever this ridiculous.
Our prime minister already said that he would legalize marijuana, that's likely why the judge is so lenient.
No one noticed the word defence? I thought i had forgotten English until I realized I was reading vice.
&gt;adding previous politicians have been too afraid of losing votes to change the laws.

This is why there are so many jokes about politicians and slimy behavior.  I don't know how it works for the frigid north, but down here... you're elected to represent your people to the best of your ability, not represent yourself.

I swear politicians spend more time and money on trying to get re-elected than actually doing their goddamn job.
It would be great if people could grow their own plants instead of having to buy from a store (where it's legal.)
This judge has to be a redditor, right?. 
Dope!
I sat in an Auckland court and watched a guy get a fine of a couple of hundred dollars for having 7 plants. It's similar in that it's a next to nothing punishment for a crime which technically has a maximum sentence of something like 7 years but there wasn't any interest in it because it was completely normal, that is, the judiciary being completely uninterested in personal drug use.

The downside of course is that there is still a conviction, which sucks.
Would it not be better for the defendant if the charges were dropped? 

I mean here, regardless of the fact that he was only fined $1, wouldnt he still have a felony conviction? 

Just curious. ELI5 and shit please.
What are the chances that the "crown attorneys, defence lawyers and judges" on this case had lit one up in chambers during the trial?
The important part of the story should be noticed.

**"Mario Larouche, 46, suffers from pain stemming from a car accident"**

This guy is self-medicating and based on that, the judge arrived at the fine of $1. The judge used common sense here. But even then the current federal government is already working on legalizing marijuana and working out the logistics of getting it legalized.

Here is the mandate letter from the Prime Minister of Canada to the justice minister to work with other ministries to get the process of legalization rolling.

http://pm.gc.ca/eng/minister-justice-and-attorney-general-canada-mandate-letter

If this had been a case of someone growing marijuana to sell then the outcome would have been different.
That judge should speak to the RCMP in Nanaimo, BC that just raided three medical dispensaries....
Congratulations, this is how you get mandatory minimums.
End the war on drugs.  

Prison is not the solution to addiction.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ao8L-0nSYzg
$1 dollar fine, $200 in court surcharges! 
Is this considered an activist judge in Quebec? In the USA he would be. Not familiar with the similarities of the system, but I don't believe they can do that here, unless laws change (or it would basically piss on everyone with harsher sentences for the same crime under the same laws).


This is great marketing for the next season of Trailer Park Boys. 
I feel like the rise of VICE has significantly increased the amount of Canadian based posts on reddit. 
THANK GOD, or whatever you believe they are finally telling the truth

So is that USD or CAD? 
I don't think it would be possible for a US judge to do that. Good on him though!
Way too hard to try and cover their tracks.
I wish the judge gave a fine of 4.20 instead 
Seriously though, if Canada legalized marijuana recreationally, what kind of impact would that have on the US, and furthermore the rest of the world where it's seen as something terrible?
What a time to be alive
My question is, when marijuana and presumably other drugs become legal, will marijuana-related charges be retroactively expunged from the criminal records of those who were caught during prohibition?  Will the fines and seized property be retroactively returned? 

Hey /u/alpha69,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
It's still on his record as a possession though? 
The guy couldn't come up with the $1.30, so he had to spend 30 days in jail.
What will we use the Swayze Express for now?!?
For once, I am proud to be a Quebecer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WULsZJxPfws
Wait, so there's a 30% tax on fines in Canada?
Awesome the second spring gets here 29 plants are going on my roof.
I predict record busts of Canadian weed in the US, and extra rabid law enforcement fury, like toddlers in tantrums that they can't control the channel switcher..
Should've been at least $5. smh
Compared to alcohol, which is legal, Cannabis isn't bad at all. Prolonged use can mess with your head but it's the least of their worries in terms of crime.
He was taxed %30 on his fine? I believe that taxes of this kind in the US are usually %7. Do Canadians normally pay a %30 tax rate?
&gt;With taxes, Larouche was fined a grand total of $1.30.

He had to pay taxes on his fine?
But 31 plants, thats prision for life!
Glad to see that someone finally did the right thing,just hope that maybe one day China could legalize weed.
TIL people have to pay taxes on their fines.
Could this legally ever happen in the US?
I hope the states catch on to this guys logic! I personally don't smoke weed but it does have its benefits. 
Someone think of the children! They are going to die now, or...erhm... something. ^^^/s
But doesn't conviction and a fine, even if $0.01 and paid still lead to it being on the record?  Shouldn't the judge have just flat out said "dismissed!" and called it a day? 


(I'm not familiar with their legal system...)
That's one of those fancy Canadian dollars though. One of them with all that fancy Monopoly Queen ink. 
First thing that came to mind : Our taxes are way too high
That judge is my hero.
This judge is the fuckin' man.  Good sir, we need more like you.
I wish QC would also reduce the fine for not locking your car to $1 from $75.

Something else which isn't worth being illegal, and a way for small municipalities to extort fine money.
Wish my judge was this understanding...
WOOHOOO VIVE LE QUEBEC OSTi!
That fine was pretty Loonie!
Less risk. More reward. More weed dealers.
Welcome to the future
ELI5: How can a judge do that if the law hasn't changed yet?
God damn taxes
What a breath of fresh air, and a small victory for common sense.
I'd buy that for a dollar!
I served 6 months in jail and was on probation for 2 years after. Paid thousands of dollars in court fines, fees, IOP, and paying to stay in jail.
r/upliftingnews
Judge Sensible
That judge smokes weed
Ricky?! Is that you!?
They tax your fine. Seems a bit ridiculous. 
That's the kind of defiant and awesome court ruling that you read about in history class 
The Prime Minister has called for legalization and regulation, setting the ministers of Justice, Public Safety, and Finance on the task. I don't think it's too surprising Judges are going to start becoming a little more lax in anticipation for this.
Why can't the US have lenient pot laws? Only reason we had them before was because we were racist and the reason we keep them is because Nixon was a tinfoil hat paranoid nut job.
&gt;According to Le Droit, the crown counsel in his case requested he be jailed for 90 days and ordered to pay a $250 fine.

Holy shit. 30 plants in the U.S. could put you in jail for decades. 
I've never been more proud to be Québecois.
Mad respect for the judge, this is possibly the most progressive jusge I have ever seen in my life.

I never smoked weed but I never understood why government is so harsh on pot heads, they are never violent.
Perhaps he should run for the legislature. It is not the place of a judge to decree the validity of a law.

How do you say puff puff pass in French?
Frame it.
Well, if Sanders isn't elected maybe I'll flee North instead of South.

This judge is a hero.

That's 1 Canadian dollar.
Cool.  Fair enough til the laws are changed.
Whoohoo!!
That small boobs one is a note from a doctor.
Quebec is a special place. A good place to visit July/August
Memes aren't supposed to put you in jail, they are supposed to set you free

MEGA UPDATE:
I have found mr. Erdogan's picture where he was showing off his wedding ring as his sole property in a party meeting in 1994 to gain the trust of the people( 5 years later he was to assert in another meeting that if he ever gets rich that means he has gotten into corruption - implying that he just wants to serve the country nothing else, and fast forward to 2015, he has a fucking palace !), they look so similar here .

That meme:  https://lagiye.com/gorseller/2015/12/gollumu-nasil-bilirdiniz-erdogana-hakaret-davasinda-gollum-arastirmasi.jpg 

And similar ones:

http://www.karsigazete.com.tr/upload/2015/03/99734.jpg


My personal note: guys, please let's share this meme/image as much as we can so that this ridiculious punishment is heard from some european authority who sometimes condemn turkey for such cases, and as a result the doctor might be re-recruited and be acquitted from the so-called insult crime he is facing

Translation:

Medical doctor from aydin city is put on a trial for sharing the image that likens president erdogan to gollum and court decided to consult an authority to specify whether gollum is a bad or good character in the movie. Hence, The case will be ended accordingly.


Doctor ciftci commented that " even starting such a case is a scandal on its own, I hope I will be acquitted along with gollum ".


And he is also fired from public service as a doctor. In return his colleagues held a demonstration for this:

http://www.evrensel.net/haber/262849/golluma-erdogan-sorusturmasinda-skandal-karar-doktor-bilgin-ciftci-memuriyetten-men-edildi

Of course nothing has changed.

 the report of he expert cemal sezgin,who is also an avid supporter of erdogan, that is required for sacking the doctor out of public service:

"
It mustn't be forgotten that Mr. Erdogan is elected democratically by the votes of 52% of turkish people, and held the chair of prime ministry for 11 years, over these years he won every single election by a long shot and formed these governments solely with his own party, without any other party's support. As he is the leader of this successful party/movement, supported by 21 million turkish citizens, he can't be target of such images. And as a result I conclude that sharing such images in social media has no contribution to our people's and our society's unity and on the contrary will provoke people with anger and hate, and beyond that this is a deliberate attempt/operation to disrespect and insult mr. Erdogan, who is elected democratically by the majority of people, by those who can't top him off by elections.
"

Guys just pass this news to your local news agents.

LEGALISE MEMES
Erdogan is an insecure, petty little man.
Worst of all is that the image is fucking hilarious. Erdogan has to chill the fuck out. 
Why do people never realise the Streisand effect? I normally would not see this or upvote it, but now i find it funny!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect
"there will be no more Erdogan memes where he is going... prison!"
I've never been so ashamed to be a Turk lately. It's just one f-ck up after another. Thankfully I live in Canada.
So is Turkey trying to be Saudi Arabia?
&gt;“insulting a public official” 


This should be everyone's right. **NO ONE** is immune from criticism. 
Someone needs to make a post that can get up voted so much it will show up on Google search like they did with Comcast and a swastika 
Arrested for memes, how god damn sad
Do you remeber [the shitstorm](https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/325b0m/russia_just_made_a_ton_of_internet_memes_illegal/) came down on Russia when Roskomnadzor banned memes "that picture public figures in a way that has no relation to their personality"? They didn't throw anyone to jail, not even fined anyone. 
The dankest meme to rule them all.
Very non-dank
2015.

Arrested for memes.

It's the future alright.
Shame on you erdogan, you destroy what Atatürk had done. Because of him, We,turks look like anti secular and anti democrat more and more. But this situtation nothing for him. While ago, Some highschool boys  had faced for jail time because they had fun with erdogan in facebook. Even he and his lawyers mess with little kids.
Smeagol until proven Gollum.
I'm having trouble accepting any government or culture where humor is literally outlawed....  like, grow the fuck up you mighty simpletons in power.
Oppressive regimes can't stop dank memes
Attention American college students...THIS is why you shouldn't be trying so damn hard to ban free expression.
Hey Turkish Government: Sorry you are so insecure that you feel the need to throw someone in jail for making a funny picture of you. Cowards.
Turkry is becoming SA, but without oil
Once again memes ruining lives. The Internet was a mistake.
Meme so dank it cause jail time
Jailing doctors for free speech expression.  Seems like the mark of an advanced culture.
If you have to convince people you are a strong leader... you are not.
That's actually an insult to Gollum!
And this Erdogan is the man Merkel is courting?
If anything it's kind of insulting to Gollum to be compared to Erdogan.
Not cool. Gollum doesn't deserve that.
What has it got in its nasty little prisonses?
Perhaps we could start a petition to get Peter Jackson to attest to Gollum's complexity and inherent 'good'.  Gollum's time with Frodo showed how his good side continued to fight against the evil influence as much as he could. Ultimately, Gollum was the hero of the story, saving Frodo and all of Middle Earth and helping to destroy Sauron.  
Nice country you have there. 
Well Turkey, if you're trying to stay out of the EU, you're doing a great job. 
Not quite as bad as Saudi Arabia but getting closer every day.

http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/12/02/world/europe/ap-eu-turkey-erdogan-gollum.html?_r=0

No matter how bad it gets in the US, let us never forget how bad other countries have it.


He's a cunt, and he does look like Gollum. 
What a joke. Damnit, I have my qualms with our North American leaders, lots of them. But it is nice to be able to be able to post a meme about them and not get landed in prison over it. If that's not an abuse of power I don't know what is. Like seriously, people are insinuating your in cahoots with Isis and you shot down a Russian fighter jet without just cause (3) and your worried about some little guy that posts a meme about you?? Give your head a shake.. Then he tries to cover up his Gollum-likeness by having a name that sounds like Aragorn. You'll never be Aragorn, Erdogan, just a filthy nasty Hobitses!
Hey doctor, have you ever seen the inside of a Turkish Prison?
Dank memes ruin dreams. 
Watching LoTR right now.  
Can confirm.  
Erdogan has an uncanny resemblance to Gollum, especially in the perched posture, sunken eyes, and obsession with the One ring.
This cant be real life, sounds like he was major rustled
Lesson learned, when you live under an oppressive dictatorial regime, don't insult the dictator publicly.  
It's almost as if Saudi Arabia and Turkey are jealous that ISIS is getting all the attention and they are showcasing their crazy side to grab some headlines themselves.
How did such a thin-skinned politician like Erdogan get elected?
How in the hell is this a NATO country with aspirations to join the EU? 
This is the country that Europe is rushing to include into the EU. 
Could you even imagine such a narcissistic asshole that you would allow someone to go to prison over such a thing?
totally worth it
Erdogan looks like four inches of skin stretched over twelve inches of skull. Like Benjamin Button fucked a catcher's mitt and then aborted the unintended consequence. Like Voldemort got caught in a grease fire. Also Saudi Arabian justice = ISIS.

Come at me bros!
You know what to do Reddit!
This shit rly grinds my gear just like my Venezuela. Shitty leaders still get elected, and re-elected, and elected again. I dont fucking get it. 
[deleted]
Lol and just last month in the UK a giant effigy of David Cameron compete with pig was burned in celebration of bonfire night. 

What a great country I live in! 
I don't think it matters whether or not gollum is a bad guy or a good guy, putting a man in prison over a satirical picture on the internet however makes you a pad person. 
Let alone unfit to lead if your self esteem is so low that you go overboard like this over a joke.
Really puts things into perspective for me. During the Canadian election in October I was posting really insulting things almost daily about "soon to be kicked to the curb" prime minister Stepehen Harper and never once had to worry about being arrested. Fuck totalitarianism. 
/r/photoshopbattles
The exposure this caused probably just circulated the meme more, honestly.
So they're putting him in a dank cell for dank memes?
And this is why they have no place in the EU.
Some people wonder why Turkey is not part of EU.
And this is a government that wants entry to the EU. Heaven forbid.
Don't these people see how insecure and petty they look when they do this?

They could just laugh it off, it would make them look so much better, having a sense of humor. Instead they ruin a guy's life. If they're trying to save face, they failed because it just makes them look like pathetic sniveling cowards.

It's like the Queen of Hearts, "OFF WITH HER HEAD!!" at the tiniest slight. It's not an enviable trait to behave that way.
Well this is going to become fun to watch when they finally get around to the eval bit of if Gollum is good or bad. This is gonna be one for the record books.
I wonder how Tony felt.
http://www.dangerouscreation.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Tony-Abbott-Funny-Meme-Gollum.jpg
I guess dank memes can melt Turkish dreams.
Funny (not so funny) how some use any news from certain regions as an excuse to reveal hatred towards entire people and cultures. Administrations, even democratically elected ones, do some terrible things and don't really represent the will or the values of their people. What was done to this doctor is a damn shame, and an embarrassment, but it's no Guantanamo. Love the people of the world, criticize governments!
The guy is doing something ridiculous. First he is busted buying oil from ISIS, then he shoots down a russian plane, then he is sending people to prison for memes. Are we sure Turkey should be in NATO?
Turkey, goddammit get your shit together.

Your idiot president is making you more ridiculous that America circa. Bush Administration.
That's what he deserves! Comparing that ugly, horrible thing to sweet, lovable Smeagol.  
What did Turkish people expect when they reelected him?
It's probably time to stop thinking of Turkey as any sort of free democratic country. Pretty sad.

My Turkish uncle said this wasn't the country he used to know anymore, when he went there again a few years ago.
TURKIIYEE YA!!

And they want to be in the EU? I don't think they belong in the EU tbh not if the majority of Turks think like or Support erdogan or what ever the fuck his name is, that pig screwer.
And this is a NATO member.
Look world. Time to demonize Turkey... 
Appearantly the doctor claimed gollum is not a villain so there is going to be an investigation about that hahhaha

With that, the judge called for an expert panel to determine whether Çiftçi’s defense is valid. The group will comprise two academics, two behavioral scientists or psychologists and an expert on cinema and television productions, according to Today’s Zaman. It has two and a half months to review to the evidence before the court reconvenes in February
Erdogan cares more about his feelings than the health of his people.
How long will he get if it's proved he's funding ISIS?
Fkn kebab
And yet another reason why Turkey will never, ever become an EU member.
Yea I can see why people, mostly Turks, say he is as and if not worst than Putin. 
was he the only one that shared the meme?
[The similarities between Erdogan and Putin are wild](http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/570122/Russia-Vladimir-Putin-Memes-Banned-Ban-Remove-Sadimir)
The fault in our memes
I wish an official from each government, that doesn't pull shit like this, would address this and tell them to stop.  Set an example ... or something.  I dunno.  It's not fair.
I used to like Turkey, been going on holiday there for half my life. I am 17. But now.. I will refuse to go with my parents and never travel there again.

[#JailMeTurkey](http://imgur.com/LYu1vy8)
So America takes down Assad because he is a supposedly vicious dictator, even though he is moderate compared to the rest of the middle east while they support Erdogan and Turkey while they openly aid ISIS? America's hypocrisy on foreign policy baffles me more and more each passing day.
In fairness his name is very LOTR-esque.
No, precious.
And these are our allies.
If it against the law he should be imprisoned.. Turkey is part of Europe and European laws allow imprisoning people for there political opinions..


Fuck my country literally 
Turkey should not be a NATO Ally. 
Yeah, don't let these guys join EU.
Alright, so Turkey is very rapidly rising on the world's shit list. After we're done with Iran and Syria and ISIS, Turkey will be the next bad guy. Got it. 
NATO - home of true "democracies" 

lololol

perhaps the next time NATO's warmongers are looking for a place to effect some 'regime change' and do that old favorite Europeon past-time of **carpet-bombing for democracy**, they can keep it "all in the family," as it were.
Am I the only person remembers when turkey thought they could get into the EU. Yeah i don't see that happening. Good job turkey 
Hahaha so sensitive.
How many Americans would be in prison if this were the case in the US?  I know my in laws would be there if Thanksgiving is any indication.
TIL he's not gollum, he's sauron.
It's almost like Erdogan's begging to have his super sekrit diapey diapey photos exposed :&gt;
Gulum, Gulum!
This would be a great TIFU story
How dares he to make fun of the Ottoman sultan!
Damn, everyone in the "West" would be in prison by now.
THE MEMES JACK
tl;dr erdogan cannot into memes. 
Erdogan sure is Gollum-like. 
When Jim Morrison referenced 'the whole shithouse going up in flames', this was the kind of stuff he was referring to I'm pretty sure.
What's in the Boooxxxxx?!?
We all know Russia accuses others when it is guilty of something, so they are probably the ones funding ISIS.
Boo, Erdogan, you whore!
Well, it looks like he's going to be known as President Gollum for years to come, so good job letting people know what offends you Tayyip.

Curse you, Streisand effect!
memes are dangerous
What a turkey.
turkey is the most westernized middle-eastern state

and you know what.. I still believe that
Erdogan, skase! Gollum-like vlaka.
memes are a fundamental basic human right
Well? Does anyone have that dank meme so we can repost it?
Assholes.
just goes to show the leader is a childish asshole that cares about his ego more than his peoples freedom. theres a reason why the doctor shared that lol.. this leader is trying compete with north korea 
Remember this next time you think your freedom of speech is being suppressed. This is what that actually looks like.

Hey /u/Karrakan,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Since when did that become a meme? It's just a picture FFS
One does not simply walk into Erdogan
Meanwhile the EU gives 3 billion to Turkey. My precious Erdogan please give the doc a ring and put him in jail for life! 
And this one [Putin ready to sue: Harry Potter's Dobby looks too much like me](http://boingboing.net/2013/09/11/putin-ready-to-sue-harry-pott.html)
What is the difference between people shaming e-racists on their homeland and this, let me tell ya Turkey got the balls to act because thats what should be done anyways, if someone acting like a retard why bother trying to fix something not fixable just use the force and remove that person from social life so that in our standart lifes we dont have to deal with HIM/her. For the first time i liked what Turkey did, wow.
Daily reminder that people think America is bad.
\#TayyipErdoğanIsGollum
Don't worry guys, Erdogan is just trying to get stale memes deleted. Nothing bad about that.

On a more serious note it's unlikely anything substantial will happen. These kind of shit happen all the time here. 
To all those who bitch and moan about everything that's wrong with the Western world and how awful our own governments are: this is why you need to get a sense of perspective.
Wacky memester strikes again!
Maybe we should stop being "friends" with countries that represent the exact opposite of the things we supposedly believe in?  Just one more thing in a long line of events that leads me to believe everything I was taught about the U.S. was/is a big god damn lie.
Omg such an idiot, now everyone can see the gollum screenshot. He made the puplicity himself :D 
So thats what I call a healthy democracy!
Jail him! How dare he insult gollum!
Literal Daesh
EU material right there.
And yet reddits twisted sense of social justice is pushing against Free Speech...Grea job guys, one day your feelings will be as protected as the turkish presidents.
Turkey is like Middle Earth.


#SueMeTurkey
Your friendly reminder that Obama has been working to get Turkey into the EU for ages. 

Fascism and oppression tastes acceptably to leftists if they aren't the ones being hurt by it, and it overall fits within their world scheme. They only scream when it hurts them personally or their friends.
Turkey needs a lesson in public relations. The charge will be acquitted, but not before the whole world has heard about it.

Actually, its more important to stop such charges in the first place!
What a moron, the president has a Twitter account. He's gonna get got.

https://twitter.com/RT_Erdogan?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfGKGSDcoUg
Doesn't he realize that he is in a position that he could be ousted in mere minutes if only 2 people agree on it.  If the US was like, your on your own and Russia was like Bombs away, it would be over.  Nato isn't going to fight Russia without the US.
Moderate muslim country. Yaaaaay!
An insult crime? Someone get Donald Trump to Turkey STAT! He will eat up the entire insult crime department. In seriousness how sad and stupid. What a waste! 
HolyMoley... The similarity will never be unseen!

And to you Turkey, Shame on you! Erdgoan, you can't take satirical humor? Are you a child? Or are you perpetuating a Muhammed-statue?
why nasty doctor compare us with that shit, we should wring his filthy neck!
they totally fit in the EU
ugh only in America can this kind of BULLSHIT happen 
I know the comparison is to a weird and disliked character, but really it's somewhat silly for Gollum to be that upset about his comparison to Erdogan. 
Now....remind me again why these douchebags are still part of NATO requiring us to side with them?
See stuff like this is why people in Europe tends to reject letting Turkey into the EU.
And this is why Turkey won't enter the EU anytime soon.... 
What a fucked up country let the the government pass these kinds of laws?
Dank memes are finally becoming illegal, feelsadman.
Corrupt piece of shit.
Why are we friends with Turkey again? 
Like there's some other gollum not from LOTR? Fluff title
I thought his precious was his golden toilet.  He bet that nobody could find that in his palace.  He bet that nobody could find an oil link between the douche and the turkey.




Nice meme
I think he owes Gollum an apology.  
&gt;faces 2 years in jail
 
this claim nowhere to be found

plus if hoars can sue, why cant president

 http://uproxx.com/webculture/2015/12/kim-kardashian-kendall-jenner-domestic-abuse/
no sense of humor
They can't do that, but they might send him to their ISIS buddies to do it for them.
man these arabs are on a roll these days.
That is the riddle that is Turkey. They cuddle up to Europe, and pretend to be a reasonable and democratic government, and then crap like this... 
I can already see the tagline for the movie that will get made about this. "The stakes were high, the memes were dank."
Maaan. I liked Turkey. Now all this stuff that's been going on recently. I don't know how to feel.
Countries should need to pass a strict series of tests before becoming our allies.
Man, what the hell, Turkey? You seemed to be doing so well. 
Amanda Seyfried's eyes are way big and are compared to golum in her MOvie TED. She is chill about that

Man, how many years could I get in a turkish prison for insulting some nutball who thinks he's important?  And who is he?  This could be fun!
Turks... this is your cue. You will show Mr. President how the Internet works, and how you can not be silenced. It's show time.
The ego of that Erdogan!
Any time I get somebody claiming that Obama is oppressing their freedoms, I look for stories like this.
He's just salty that he wasn't compared to Sauron.
You see you just lose all authority and respect if you're not big enough to take this sort of criticism, it's the don't criticise "the leader" syndrome again, or else...., it reeks of weakness and childishness on the part of those in power. My contempt has reached a new level.
lol. i wish obama would do things like this
I imagine he didn't leave them with the possibility of taking him alive. Still, it sucks that he's got his 'martyrdom' rather than imprisonment.
here is this detailed animation of the happenings

https://twitter.com/itele/status/667261888636456960?ref_src=twsrc^tfw

RIP dog
Au revoir et adieu, enculé.
On to the next one
Anyone else see the woman's head and partial spinal column on the ground, in front of the mattress, in the third picture in the series? I don't think CNN noticed this or they would have put a graphic warning up. Or maybe i am imagining it.

(NSFL)
http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/18/world/gallery/french-raid-in-saint-denis/index.html

edit: Added a NSFL tag since people seem to think i am right. 
The best part is not hearing about him being in hiding for the next decade.
*Though meagre joy is found in death,*  
*I'll gladly say with ease:*  
*I will not waste a single breath*  
*To mourn such men as these.*
His poor neighbors must have had a scare to learn that a raid was going on, and a larger scare to find out they live near an ISIS terrorist.

[One of his neighbors is fly as fuck though.](http://i.imgur.com/aZs3ofr.jpg)
He looks young as fuck.
I am so glad he wasn't refered to as a "mastermind". Makes him sound like a Bond villian, not some psychopathic asshole.
As French citizens: it is a relief
Would have been nice to see him face trial.
Fantastic news! Well done France.

Edit: A question about one of the new security measures Belgium is implementing. People who have gone abroad to fight with ISIS will be jailed upon their return. This makes total sense to me. ISIS has openly declared war on the West, so fighting with them would constitute treason, no? I'm just wondering why this law wasn't enacted before this horrible tragedy. Were there legal obstacles?
Counter-Terrorists win.
Revenge is a Daesh best served cold.
Burn in hell, cocksucker. The police dog whose life you took was worth yours twice over.
Hopefully CNN.com will stop using such unnecessarily large fonts now...
Martyrdom is how they explain away being cowards. There's no honor in anything they're doing, and by killing themselves, they don't have to own up to that. They're just cowards.

adios motherfucker. 
Rest in pieces, asshole
Adopt the Russian method and bury him with pig parts. 
France needs this win. It's horrible that it's come to this, but it really shows the power of the French people. 
As a French this is the first relief I feel since the attacks. Peace to the families.
"His body riddled with bullets and shrapnel..."

I'm not one to wish death upon people, but damn it I hope he suffered.
&gt;His body was found riddled with bullets

&gt;The prosecutor's office said it was still unclear whether Abaaoud had blown himself up or not

How can you not tell the difference?

Either way, good news on catching the motherfucker. 
I'm glad people are using the term 'ringleader'. I've seen some headlines with 'mastermind' as though it takes some kind of genius to come up with the plan of shooting unarmed people in a crowd.
I'd say that the dog's life was worth more than his, but that would imply that his life was worth anything. Good riddance. I hope it hurt the entire time he was dying.
Good. The delusion of 'martyrdom', and of it being the surest way to "paradise", has to be among the most toxic ideologies ever created by 7th-century desert-strewn bumpkins. 
His death was a painful one. The Raid threw some stun grenade designed to make the target deaf for some times. It's not supposed to be lethal so odds are the guy was hurt, but wasn't dead yet. They threw 20 of those in a row (they didn't think it had hit him). In the end the body was in such a bad state he was unidentifiable. They got his name thanks to the fingerprints.
&gt; "Paris attacks ringleader dead"  
  
and nothing of value was lost
Can someone explain why they don't use psychological warfare against these people? Making sure that all of ISIS knows their bodies, if recovered, will be cremated/burned? A promise that any executions will be carried out by women? Bombs that drop pig parts all over them? Special pig-skin covered bullets or something?
We can't assume he's the sole ringleader that's in charge of attacks like this. There are sure to be many more
Good.  I hope that cuntwrap supreme bled out slowly.
Sad that they didn't get him alive! They may have gotten some useful intel and terrorists should face the same legal punishments as everyone else..
This is good news. However, there are many like him. 
This will be a bloody destruction of ISIS.  Hope each and everyone of them gets their eyeballs turned into pulp. Fucking cunts.

I want to piss on his corpse.
This dude's name looks like a really bad pick in Scrabble.  If I drew "ABAAOUD," I'd just flip the board and walk off.
Good. 
I'm kind of torn on how I feel about the whole refugee "crisis," but I think it's important to note how the media is spinning the story here. 


Liberals keep repeating that all 8 of the terror suspects were European nationals, which is true. Conservatives keep repeating that some of the suspects entered Europe as refugees, which is also true.


The fact of the matter is that this guy, a European national, defected to ISIS in Syria, and then snuck his way back into the EU as a "refugee." 
Good
Good on you, France. Keep making those Daesh cunts pay.
If only there was a prison to house all of them. A place fitting for people like this. An Island preferably.
Another Muslims terrorist dead.

Good riddance.

Rot In Piss, assbag
&gt;His body was found riddled with bullets and shrapnel

This sentence made me smile
Good riddance, fucking coward. 
Well done French and Belgian forces. Keep it up and kill all these cockroaches
my favorite part is that they had to run a DNA test. He got fucked up.
Great summary. Apparently the woman suicide bomber's head blew off into the street. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3324632/Mastermind-s-cousin-blew-cops-stormed-terror-HQ-amid-seven-hour-gunfight-did-die-her.html
downvoters are isis
Man, what a sad fucking existence. You could've done something with your life, and instead you just became a piece of shit.
Piece of shit.

Unfortunately not alive but at least they arrested some of them before they could blow themselves up.
[deleted]
He was identified by fingerprints and DNA... So he REALLY got screwed up. 
Can we bury him with a pig?
I usually hate war and killing people, but it's about time we get them back. Isis needs to learn we're going to stick up for ourselves.
A big thanks to the men and women who risked their lives to stop more lives from being lost
Dump his body in boiling pig fat!
For the family's directly affected by these atrocious attacks I hope they find peace for their loved ones who they have lost and those that have been injured physical and mentally. I know no words that can help fill their loss but as a society we need to pull together to make a stand and show that we will not be broken.
'mastermind', 'ringleader' -- why do they need to sensationalize this criminal?
I hope whatever afterlife you have, it is fucking torture
good
I hate that they refer to this piece of dogshit as "mastermind".

"Hey, we're gonna shoot people and blow ourselves up!"

Yeah, a *real* solid plan.  Must've taken months of dedicated preparation.
I hope he died scared and in pain.
The best part is when that fucking scum fuck died he never got to get all his virgins chilling up in heaven with Allah. 
Did they teabag his dead body?
Wow the French don't fuck around.
May your virgins be masculine, and riddled with smegma
On l'emmerde.
Why is ISIS so far ahead of us in terms of propaganda?  Why not use our vastly superior movie production and CGI skills and create a video whereby we take one of these supposed leaders and have them recant their actions as they take their last breathe and have them "say" that it wasn't worth it in the end. Not torture the guy but just create it as a bit of news and then social media the crap out of it so that potential recruits see it. If we're not willing to go all in on a war, then let's lie and cheat and use propaganda as well as they do. 
Poor dog...
Glad to see him referred to as a 'ringleader' rather a 'mastermind'. Still a better term could be used: radical, terrorist, cocksucker. Any would do. 
Counter-Terrorists win.
I'm just glad that they attacked him dead.
SHAKE THAT ASS BITCH AND LET ME SEE WHAT YOU GOT!
As French citizens: it is a relief
I'm disappointed he didn't stand trial. If we kill people we consider criminals without trial, how are we better than IS? But considering the circumstances, there was no other way I suppose.
Yeah, he's getting his real punishment in the afterlife now...

The wars against nations are over. Now we fear anyone, anywhere at anytime, and "to protect us from these threats", we give up our rights a little more, every time. It's no longer big bad Russia that's way far away, it's literally anyone. Be afraid, be very, afraid 
[Video of the kamikaze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fz0RY6GmGrA)
Even though it would've been better to apprehend him and for him to stand trial, I think it's better than the wait period that USA had to endure until they killed Bin Laden.
I keep looking at the photo of him and trying to wrap my head around the idea that that this ~~is~~ was a ~~person~~ ~~animal~~ thing who would kill me, my husband, my baby daughter, and anyone else I know and love if we happened to be in his line of sight. There are no words horrible enough to describe these...these... damn it.
Cover that fucker in bacon and call it a day.  Even if he's doing the will of his batshit crazy god, I'd like to double down on their own belief and make sure he ends up in hell.
GOOD RIDDANCE! VIVE LA FRANCE! I am glad Russia have joined in with the western forces, but I am embarrassed that my government (U.K.) has yet to properly commit to supporting the joint offensive. To anyone in France or of French descent who reads this, be aware; We, the British people are reeling from your loss as you are - we are only seperated by the channel/la manche. You are one of our closest allies and one of the countries with whom our historic ties lie deepest. When you are wounded, we bleed with you.

I'm not a revenge or violent type of guy.

But good riddance. Fuck him.

That feels weird to type.
It was Abaaoud time!
Im happy he's dead
As a side note, he was the guy seen a few months ago in a video dragging mutilated bodies behind his pickup
This might not bring any of the victims back, but it will prevent future attacks being planned by this cunt.
Would have been much better if you tortured him, he got the easy way out in comparison to what he did.
More will unfortunately replace him. 
How do you fight an enemy that is always willing to die? 
I just hope the French catch a few terrorists and dust off the old guillotine. No need to sharpen the blade though.
Haha.  Dumbass terrorist.
"Gentle" reminder that you don't fuck with France anymore.
My first thought when they said he had to be ID'd by fingerprints was watching the theater scene in Inglorious Basterds.
Good. I hope he suffered, and I hope he rots in hell with the other douchebags.
Good riddance.
It would have been nice to whip him and beat him daily.
Thank fuck. the world's a better place without him.
They should flush his body down a toilet
Fuck that guy.
Good, now keep dropping bombs 
One less.  
France is definitely stepping it up now.
YAAAAAAAAAAAAY!
Yes !!
Good. 
It was just a matter of time until they put their hand on him , I'm glad it only took less than a week.
It's odd that the female terrorist chose to build a large chunk of her image/name on something so iconically American.  Lots of undiagnosed mental issues were going on in that head even before she strapped on a suicide vest.
Good Riddance
Don't get me wrong, FUCK that guy. But he looks like a pretty nice and fun-lovin' dude in the photo. And that's a scary thing to think about -- that these terrorists can be perfectly nice and normal on the surface, yet they're really just fucking twats on the inside. 
I doubt the world will miss him. The French Police force sure as hell didn't!
as a Belgian citizen, I can confirm that this is not a big loss for us. 

&gt;His body was found riddled with bullets and shrapnel in a shattered apartment in the northern suburb.

I never thought I would be happy to read a sentence like this. 


Also, I can't find the link and I'm too tired to try, but his family will be happy to know he's dead. 

Long story short, he was a wayward son and they aren't sure where he turned evil. IIRC he was Moroccan and had a good upbringing in Belgium, and his parents were appalled by the man he had become, and actually prayed for his death.
Defective human. Return to sender.
Well I hope this guy is mercilessly raped in whatever hell he rots in for eternity. 
Good riddance!

He'll be shocked to discover that not only will he not be getting 72 virgins, he won't be getting 1.
I'll take ringleader over mastermind any day. The UK papers need to take a look at themselves.
Good. Nothing else need be said. They're not worth the words.
hope he suffered greatly
Bye, Felicia Muhammad! 
A quick death was too easy for him.
5000 bullets and no one was else was injured with stray bullets or glass, that is some excellent gun control and a big jar of luck
clearly reddit did it.
My only regret is that there is no footage of the last breath leaving his worthless carcass
In a very hot flame filled paradise now. No virgins around except him.
Can we stop calling them ringleaders and masterminds? They would be shamed if all news called them something insulting to them, like cross dressing asxuals or chicken fuckers 
&gt;Investigators are still looking for another suspect, Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have travelled to Belgium after the attacks on Friday night.

#

&gt;Earlier on Thursday, Belgian police raided properties linked to Salah Abdeslam , who is believed to have blown himself up outside the Stade de France stadium during Friday's attacks.

So after blowing himself up, he traveled to Belgium?
I hope headlines like this become a daily thing until the entire problem has been weeded out. France is better than these tyrannical psychos.
He was a big coward who sent others in to do the dirty work. I'm glad he got found. It must have been frightening for him when the cops surrounded his apartment. Let's be thankful for that.
I guess he got squashed
Bye Adelisha.
Not bad for a weeks worth of work. 
Can you even imagine not having any idea who is living next to you, and then all hell breaks loose? I mean, to blend in, these terrorists might have even given a bundt cake to new neighbors. 
Lol
Die MotherFucker...
"A ringleader in the city's Jihad scene"

Better import a few thousand more of them. What could go wrong. 
Hey, how's that ISIS shit workin out for ya, man?

I wish they would have caught your last 5 minutes on video......I'd have loved to see that smile of yours disappear into that look of absolute terror.....as the slugs zip right the fuck through you.
It always amazes me how the 'ringleader' is never the one doing the attacking.
[Haha you're dead!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CYkZcPYXQI)
I fucking hate ISIS
Unfortunately, it's still only one out of many extremists, and one out of even many more of the sleeper agents also known as muslims.
They attacked him dead. They attacked him until he died from it. 
Good.
I'm surprised that was a lot faster then finding osama
yippee ki yay motherfucker
I hope his dick got shot off in the process and eaten by a mongoose 
I really hate to be that guy, but ultimately if he was in France, and more of a point in France still after the attack, he was expendable and possibly this was the intent. They caused media terrorism and the media eats it up and the populace remains scared. Their recruitment booms cause they think they are inflicting real damage on us, and its a vicious cycle. Its no different from mass shooting mentality, these people want to be eternalized in the media and we give it to them.
Civilian view. http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=d44_1447880564

Can you imagine it, its like footage from Afghanistan...in Paris, mental.
Shit...no wonder they're so pissy. Collectively, they're the ugliest people I've ever seen. They look like there's some serious inbreeding going on.
FLUSH THAT TURD DOWN THE DRAIN
One detail I'm not seeing being covered is how they know it's him. They said they identified him by his fingerprints. So.. he's been in custody before?
... Can I get a face swap on Bilal and Ahmad? 

I'm sorry given...

It's just that I was looking at Ahmad's large face when I noticed that Bilal's face is tiny for his head and that blow out isn't doing him any favors. They look like caricatures of themselves and the juxtaposition tops it off... Irreverant, I know, just one of those things you find humor in despite the circumstances.

I hate when they call them "masterminds". Being a coward motherfucker who kills innocent people makes you a psychopathic piece of shit, not anything more.
I'd like to know why these media dickheads classify a coward who planned to shoot a bunch of unarmed people as a mastermind.It seems like a pretty big jump to me.
Bet he doesn't have that shit-eating grin any more. Can we have pics please?
&gt;police are also investigating a possible connection to an attack on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris in August

Was this the one where the US Marines that were on leave beat the guy batshit?
Good.
Counter-Terrorism wins 
Why do I keep reading 72 virgins 

Is that what they believe they get in the afterlife? 
Good.
Quite a name - "I'd like to buy an 'A', Pat." OOOOHHHHHH!!!!!!
Great news!
It sucks he couldn't be taken alive. Don't get me wrong, I don't give two fucks about this piece of scum's life. It just sucks that when he died he potentially took information that could be used against ISIS with him.
Some people said he is the ringleader, this must be true.
I hope it was a slow and agonizing death.
bon débarras
bon débarras
So... He was fucking his cousin
May he rest in piss.
'To shreds,' you say?
Now if only the leader of the New Zealand attacks was dead
I'm surprised he was even in Europe, let alone in Paris
They didn't just attack the ringleader...they attacked him *dead*. 
That's one ringleader down, but who knows how many more are out there? 
What does "Daesh" mean?
Islam is not a race
Ringleader is appropriate - I'm sick of hearing them refer to this asshole as a "mastermind" on the news.  Shooting unarmed people with assault rifles does not make you a fucking mastermind....
Just like the US did with Osama, I wish we'll sink his body - or what is left of it - to the bottom of the sea.
Wow. I lived directly across the street from there about a year ago.
Rest in piss, you fucking dickfuck. 
should of died a slow painful death in one of them Russian max security prisons. 
Des cendres vous venez, et aux cendres vous retournerez, bande de fils de putes.
No guillotine? :(
*plays imagine on a piano* 
There will be another until we stop treating terrorist as criminals.  Phrases like "we will bring them to justice" just evoke this notion they do and will do bad, and we must suffer the consequences, but then we will use the police to hunt them down.

If that's the notion the terrorists will always win.  

Look at the latest edict from German government: don't walk in groups.  Gee, thanks.  Is breathing OK?  

Latest from Italy: don't go to the Vatican, and be careful at restaurants.  Great stuff, team.  Guess I should just hide under my bed forever. 

Terrorist have to be hunted down before they can strike.  but there are few who have the stomach and willpower to pursue that course.   Certainly no one in Europe or the USA (despite what all the yahoos running for president claim...)
Meanwhile his PR guy is in the background having a stroke
What does Turkey have to gain from this? 
In other news the office of the Prime Minister will be hiring full-time food tasters, apply today!
People need to realize the real situation here.

The assholes in charge of Turkey are supporting some assholes in Syria. The assholes in charge of Russia are supporting different assholes in Syria. 

The western world can't find anyone to support in Syria who isn't an asshole, except possibly the Kurds. Except that the US doesn't want to support the Kurds *too* much because it would piss off the assholes in charge of Turkey. Even though the Turks are assholes, they used to not be assholes and the US kind of wants them to not be assholes again. So the US doesn't want to be assholes to Turkey, even though it means kind of being assholes to the Kurds. 

So when some *other* assholes in Syria (who **everyone** agrees are assholes) attacked the French, the Russians decided to use it as an excuse to bomb some of the assholes in Syria that they don't like, and they figured no one would really pay much attention to whether or not the assholes they bombed were actually the assholes who attacked the French. And the western governments pretty much decided to just not make a fuss about specifically which assholes the Russians bombed, since they are all assholes. 

Except that the Turks were pissed that the Russians were bombing *their* assholes. So they decided to be assholes and kill the assholes who were killing their assholes.

Meanwhile, the Syrian people are stuck in the middle. Surrounded by assholes on all sides, with pretty much no hope of anyone who isn't an asshole coming to help them.
Why the fuck would you even say that?

Edit: guys holy fuck.  I replied to an 11 word headline with a 9 word quip and you guys upvoted the shit out of it and raped my inbox.  Come on, it wasn't even clever or anything.  I didn't even read the fuckin article.  Yeah I said it.  I only have a cursory idea of what is going on. 
The amount of warmongering and over exaggeration in these threads is astounding, this'll be a political crisis at worse. 
The political equivalent of "Come at me bro".
/r/micromanagement
"And I'll have you know, my penis is exactly 6 and a HALF inches long, compared to Vladmir Putin's measly 6 and a quarter!" continued the Turkish PM
"*and I shall kill him... myself*." - Putin, topless, while saddling up a bear.

Bold move there Cotton
Hey it's Turkey's right to start a war with Russia as well as to run supply lines for ISIS if they want to.
[deleted]
Turkey ruining Thanksgiving again.
It is more disgusting how the parliament is cheering on and the PM takes it like it is some kind of joke. 
Omg guys you know what's going to happen now, right? Nothing, that's what. Calm the hell down.
In Soviet Russia Turkey shoots you.
IT'S JUST A PRANK, BRO!
Turkey + Saudi Arabia + Qatar = ISIS
IIRC, Russia has breached Turkey's airspace multiple times. The fact that Russia was only in its airspace for a few seconds suggests to me this was basically a dick waving maneuver by Turkey letting Russia know it's not fucking around. The fact one of the men in the plane were killed probably came as unexpected and that's probably got Turkey a little tense. Seeing as this happened to Russia, I'm guessing they might be doing a little dick waving of their own in retaliation - but I certainly don't think it will amount a WW3 scenario - at least not yet.
This little piece:  "The United States, however, seems to be privately disagreeing with Ankara’s assessment believing that the Russian jet shot down by Turkey on Tuesday was hit inside Syrian airspace after a brief incursion into Turkish airspace, according to top US official who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity."
It's a common political strategy. By stating that the central government gave the order, Turkey signaling resolve. In other words, they are sending a message to the Russians that they won't back down. 

Consider Russian options. They can:
1. Threaten Turkey (which Putin is essentially doing by sending advanced anti-air systems to Syria). 
2. Back down and be more careful to avoid Turkish airspace in the future.

Likewise, Turkey has two options:
1. Stand firm (continue to shoot down Russian jets in their airspace)
2. Back down (say 'oops, accident, won't happen again')

The worst case scenario for both countries is that they both choose option 1: This leads to fighting

The best case scenario for each country is to take option 1 and have the opponent back down. This is a 'win' that doesn't include any actual fighting.

Therefore, each wants to convince the other country that they are going to choose option 1 no matter what. If one country can 'prove' its resolve to stand firm, the best option for the other country is to back down. Importantly, this is true regardless of whether or not each country is actually willing to fight over the issue.

So it makes sense that the Turks would want to take responsibility for shooting down the jet. This signal's Turkey's intent to choose option 1, and therefore coerce Russia into backing down.

TL/DR: Turkey claims responsibility to signal to the Russians that they are serious about defending their airspace and will continue to do so. Since Russia doesn't want to get into an air war with Turkey, Russia's best option is to avoid Turkish airspace in the future.
Captain badass looking hard as shit hiding behind NATO
»Look, world...I'm retarded AND incompetent.« 
WTF is Turkey doing? Fighting for or against Daesh? 
The United States are smart to stay out of this one. Both of these leaders are crazy and one is supporting a homicidal dictator and the other is supporting ISIS.
Has anyone considered the possibility that Turkey might be trying to drag NATO into a conflict with Russia?  Shooting down a plane that spent a mere 17 seconds inside their airspace is ridiculously over the top, and there's no way in hell the PM would have had the time to give the order, I doubt he was even notified until after it happened.  Russia repeatedly violates many countries' airspace, none of them have ever shot down one of the trespassing planes; but Turkey does the same thing all the time, it's a little hypocritical to come down on someone for doing the exact same thing you do.  This doesn't sit right with me; Turkey's hiding sometheing, even if it's just "one of our guys panicked and shot it down by accident".  I hope we find out sooner rather than later.
Istanbul was once Constantinople 
Turkey is making millions off the oil that syrian rebels  sell. So russia attacks said rebels, cutting off the oil and the money and turkey gets mad and shoots one of their planes down. Its simple, air space is not something to start a war over, but hundreds of millions of dollars is. 
He couldn't be trying harder to start a World War if he were a Serbian royal assassin.

But seriously, the last thing the world needs now in that area is bellicose leaders being deliberately provocative. 
Lets see, a plane going 5 miles a minute crosses 3.2 miles and is given ten warnings, and the head islamomofo is alerted, briefed and gives the fire order. Obama has to be in awe of this guys ability to lie.
So has ISIS started WWIII?
There was a scene in "The Sum of All Fears, where the Russian President admitted to giving an order he in reality did not. He said:

&gt;"These days, better to appear guilty than impotent."


Who knew Erogden was such an excellent miner, digging holes as deep as he does 
He's a child. Children make demonstrations like this. With everything happening right now, it's not the time to act like a child.
As a Canadian i would just like to say, if we shot at every Russian aircraft that came into our airspace we would be super fucked
"I'd like to have one suicide please"
Armchair strategists seem a bit harsh on Turkey's actions. Hasn't Russia been trolling the world now for years, quietly invading Crimea, shooting down passenger jets, swanning right through other countries' airspace despite warnings (if that is what happened - Russia and Turkey seem to be telling very different stories, though Russia has certainly seemed rather liberal with the truth in recent years)? I doubt it was a great decision on Turkey's behalf, but letting Russia get away with whatever the fuck it wants isn't a terrific approach either.
Clearly planned ahead if the jet was only in Turkey for seconds even minutes
You've got balls, Turkey PM. But now Russia's gonna do their best at tearing them off and feeding them back to you. 
ITT: kids who think they are call of duty generals who want WW3

As politically exciting as this is, it frightens me that my family there may now suffer the consequences of Erdogan's inflated ego. His party is a huge collection of corrupt assholes, who rig elections and aren't even supported by the majority of Turks. I'm so embarrassed that this is how the world is viewing our country now.


Cunt.
Although Russia does not celebrate thanksgiving, they sure want a piece of Turkey it seems.
"I was me Putin! It was me all along!"
you know what also works instead of shooting it down? escorting it away.
Lets kick Turkey out of NATO and unfriend Saudi Arabia.
I gave the order, but it was an order for pizza, I had no idea this would happen. 

I distincly remember saying, "Shoot.... A plain pizza down to the crust."
I must say the Turkish bureaucracy is magnificently efficient if the President himself was able to give such an order within a 5 minute timeframe.
They are such hypocrites, their fighter jets are violating the greek aerospace pretty much on a daily basis and even though the greek air force has always locked them up they never fired at them. According to them from now on the Greek air force should be shooting their fighter jets down. And the US should be fine with this too. 
World war III creeping closer and clearly polititians doing their level best to calm situations down. What a wonderful species we are. 
At this point, do you think it is plausible that Putin would declare war on Turkey?
He is a willing pawn for NATO.
No! Turkey! You were supposed to bring balance to the middle east, not destroy it!!
If you want to commit political, career or even just regular suicide... surely there has *got to be* easier way than that.
I gotta say, considering how long the plane was in Turkish airspace, this is by far the most efficient command and control system in the world.
This guy isn't exactly known for making the brightest quotes. Example?

&gt; “We’ll eradicate Twitter. I don’t care what the international community says. Everyone will witness the power of the Turkish Republic.”


I'll take the Turkish PM at his word.  
A jet fighter crossing a two-mile strip of Turkish real estate does not offer much of a time window.  
With reaction time like that Usain Bolt should be nervous.  
So, in a mere 17 seconds, the PM and pilot got in touch with each other and then scrambled across the border, violating Syrian airspace to shoot down a Russian bomber that was targeting Daesh? No NATO protection for you Turkey. Do you know what happens to Turkey at this time of year?
Obama pardoned two turkeys this week.

Turkey's PM is like,  "I ain't pardoning shit, shoot that bird down."
If the plane was only over Turkey for 10 seconds (or a few minutes at best), then his order must have been to shoot at the first possible opportunity. To what end? 
Do you wanna get Russia to sanction/invade/destroy you?

because thats how you get Russia to sanction/invade/destroy you?
Turkey can join the list of countries that can officially fuck off.
Man, how did everyone suddenly get so pro-russian around here!? 

I mean, I agree, shooting down that plane was stupid and reckless and NATO would probably be better off without member states who will do this kind of thing. 

But ever since it happened, I can't help but thinking that, at the very least, they didn't shoot down an airplane full of tourists... 
Even using the name of Islam to maintain powers is waning thin with Muslims.  Hopefully the citizen of Turkey can kick this dumbass out of office, along with Endrogan.  
So within 17 seconds, they gave ten orders, requested permission to shoot them down, received confirmation from the PM, and shot them down?
I would expect my country to shoot down any foreign military plane in our airspace after a warning unless it was authorised (joint exercises, allies etc). The Russians have shot down US spy planes and Korean civilian passenger planes. They know the risks when they send their pilots into foreign airspace. It doesn't really matter if it is Turkey or some other country. Sovereign nations protect their airspace. Ofcourse, it might have been more sensible, politically, just to get a lock on them and give them a chance to run away but not sure a fighter plane is the place to be playing politics.
At least now we know who should be hanged when the regime in Ankara falls.
This idiot PM...for the sake of his pride he ruined what really could been a meaningful alliance to end ISIS.

All to protect a group of savages that shoot down helpless pilots in a parachute.  What a shitty way to die.
It's funny because he's acting cocky as if NATO will back him up when Russia attacks
Remember the movie Sum of all Fears...  where a rogue Russian commander ordered an attack on a US carrier, but the Russian president said it was his order just to give the appearance to the world that he was in full control of his army commanders.  Just saying...
Turkey has violated Greek Airspace no less than 2244 IN 2014 ALONE!!! It costs Greece millions of euros each year to chase Turkish fighter jets out of its airspace. Prime Minister Davutoğlu and President Erdogan ok'd downing a Russian plane because they claim that the Russian violate Turkish airspace for 17 SECONDS!!!!??? Let's get real here. Call a spade a spade. This was an act or war.
This needs to be an Insanity Wolf meme.
If there is ever another war in Europe it will come from some damn fool thing in the Balkans. - Otto von Bismark

Strange how so little things have changed..
Turkey is a Daesh (ISIS) supporter.  They

* allow people to travel freely through Turkey in order to join Daesh or come back to Europe to wreak havoc (e.g. Paris)
* have been bombing the Kurds who have been most effective fighting against the Daesh
* have attempted to start WW III by attacking the Russians as a NATO member
* still won't admit to having committed the Armenian genocide (not directly related, but shows what scumbags they are)

Why in the hell aren't the other NATO allies kicking Turkey out already?
In 17 seconds! Turkey managed to give 10 warnings, call their PM and have him issue the command to take down the Russian Plane.  Yeah.. I believe none of that garbage. 

The more realistic view would be that they already had planned to shoot down any Russian plane that got too close or that meddled with their plans. 

Really fucked up.  
Well at least he is not blaming it on an Ukrainian SU-25
So, he's owning up to it before the word leaks out that it was him. The time sounds about right, 17 seconds. The possibility that the jet was shot down in Syria's airspace only adds support to the political agenda behind the downing, and hints at a considerable bit of hypocrisy if you keep in mind how much Syria's airspace has been violated by N.A.T.O. nations.
He forgot to mention it was Erdogan that he got ordered from
it's also possible that an impatient military officer gave the orders to proceed.  The PM had to say that he is responsible or else it would appear that there is a lack of control over the armed forces.  To confirm this scenario, look out for the sacking of any high ranking military official in the near future.
troll level: 9,000
i think what he said was lost in translation, im pretty sure what he said was "because fuck russia"
It's like, do they really want a WW3 centered on the Middle East? Because I can only see one outcome, and that involves the Middle East looking like the setting for the next Fallout game.
I'm so outraged about this I'm going to eat a turkey tomorrow in protest.
So it's Turkey season over Syria now- smart move fucktards-
Erdogan's *Highway to the Danger Zone*.
Crimea is not the first Russian planes that violate Turkish airspace days or weeks before.
He's got some balls 
&gt;A game of I'm-not-touching-you escalates to homicide. Shortly thereafter, the man responsible for the lives lost responds with epic trolling. 
So they had time to call up the prime minister on a 17 second violation? 
Is ThinkPol the only place reporting this?

Edit. Really ThinkPol is the only place reporting this as far as I can tell. What the fuck is ThinkPol? 
That's sort of crazy the jet was only in their airspace for 17 seconds but that was enough time for radar guys to talk to their boss to talk to general boss to talk to el presidente 
...douchebag
Why do I always get the feeling that Turkey is not serious about fighting ISIS. 
I don't believe putin is going to go to war over this but he can still do some major damage against turkey regardless. 
*He can arm the kurds fighting the turkish government
*Cut off turkey's natural gas supply (over 57% of their gas comes from russia.
*Block russian toursim to turkey
*Stop selling military arms to turkey
*Cancel construction of gas pipeline through turkey and nuclear power plant


I am so out of the loop here.  Can someone please explain the situation here?

I thought the plane was in Turkish airspace, so why are people surprised it was shot down?  Plus the pilot that was dead, was found dead, and not killed after he was shot down.
i look at this entire thing and think to myself" had this been a US plane shot down" ....
Oh god, who cares.  World War Three is not in anyone's best interest.  Stop acting like any political event could be 'the breaking point.'  Worse things are going on and lets just face it...WWIII is not happening.  The United States, China, and Russia all act like enemies for the sake of the small man (the people).  Really, they're just frenemies.  The financial loses across the board in a full on conflict between any of the major powers would be devastating for all sides involved.  The world of powers probably understands these scenarios quite a bit more than any of us do, which means they understand the consequences, the gains, the losses.  Even the winner of a world war is going to be set back by years if not decades economically.  The next war involving the whole world will most likely be an economic alliance of the three major powers finally saying "Enough bullshit, you control that, I control this and he controls that."

Or aliens.
Wow, who would have expected Turkey to be on the hot seat this Thanksgiving?
Why was the letter from UN in miles instead of kilometers?
[deleted]
If I recall the jets are typically scared away multiple times. Don't recall anyone actually doing this. 
Who else flies jets around Syria? Is ISIL flying jets around? God Turkey PM.. You are a turkey!
When keeping it real goes wrong. World edition.
Where the hell is Turkish Rambo when you need him?!
Wow. 17 seconds. That's not even long enough to have a radio conversation requesting the plane to leave the airspace, let alone for the plane to actually do it.

I get worried when world leaders do totally irrational things, and lately they seem to be mounting up. We need Sam Jackson to get all these guys together and tell them all to "Calm the fuck down."
The really crappy thing in all of this is Turkey is in NATO. Depending on how this plays out NATO could be pulled into war with Russia. In all likelihood, nothing will come out of this as, like other people have said, this is relatively minor. And if Russia does attack, well it is going to get very complicated as the quote seems to make turkey an "aggressor". 
This is the alleged audio of the Turkish pilot warning the Russians.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt0SPfPFYUQ
while its refreshing to see someone not afraid of putin, jesus dude.  maybe you should watch the fuck out for that putin guy.
What kind of a fucking idiot
recognise the incursion, engage, get approval from the fucking prime minister and execute within 17s. Now that's an impressive achievement.

I heard about Article 5, and if Russia retaliates, it's not good.
That's because erdogan wants to be the Caliph himself.
Turkey violates Greek around airspace 2100 times a year
I can't wait to see the smile wiped off his face when he tries it again...
Damn, was obvious as hell but I didn't think they'd be so stupid as to confirm it.  
Erdogan, are you TRYING to get yourself assasinated? Because Putin is the type of guy who would do it himself.
He fucked up
Annnnnnnd this is how nuclear wars begin.
He's the man with balls...!!
So... what, regime change?
And Obama supports this asshole. 
NATO has already stated that they will back them up. They are kinda involving now themselves so that wouldn't have to later. Let me explain. Turkey shoots down a bomber and Russia is pissed. Now obviously if they wanted to retaliate in its entirety Turkey simple wouldn't survive the war that would ensue. But all of Europe and others would be almost obligated to interfere or offer aid. So when Turkey shoots a bomber they backed them up because Russia will probably not fight all the countries who are apart of NATO. If they back them up now. Russia doesn't act. At least officially. Some black op shit may happen, but that's another story. Very smart on NATO and Turkey for simply saying yes I did it and we will back them. 
Least he isn't throwing some poor soldier under the bus and blaming them for the entire incident.

Tomorrows Headlines: Turkish Prime Minister assasinated by KGB
How do you make that decision in 17 seconds? 
Its like he is bragging. 
Apparently, the radio traffic from this incident was captured from an additional source - 

http://theaviationist.com/2015/11/24/audio-tuaf-warns-ruaf-su-24/

I'm not placing blame here. Just stating that *if this audio is legit*, at least one thing lines up with Turkey. If legit, they're telling the truth about broadcasting on the emergency channel.

That said, I see *both* sides of the argument. 
I AM SPARTACUS!
"How utterly assinine! The geopolitical events leading up to World War One were an intricate tapestry that wove together threads of national pride, hunger for war and zealous camaraderie which saw the formation of "pals battalions. There simple isn't the landscape for war in this day and age. I'd love to see those warmongers faces when the draft letter lands on their doorstep."
The other 10% of reddit comments I have read.
Total bullshit.  There's no way they could have engaged the PM in time to order that shootdown.  Complete and total lies.  
This just in "Turkish PM mothers head arrives in a box at the presidential mansion warped in a Russian flag." 

This guy is sooo fucked. 
So he gave the order to shoot down the plane himeslf, and he's also admitted that they did not know it was a Russian plane.

It could have been anyones aircraft. I hope to god that the UK does not get involved in airstrikes over Syria as Cameron wants. This is an unbelieveable clusterfuck.
I have a question. As far as i got it: Russian plane into turkish territory -&gt; shot down -&gt; Pilot ejects. So who the fuck killed the pilot and why? I mean... take him as prisoner or sue russia or something bu why would they kill him  ?
The Russians know they are playing mind games with Turkey by buzzing their border all the time but this might have been a message by Turkey, "Stop sending your planes so close to us". They knew it was Russian and the Russians know this. It shouldn't have been shot down, the territorial airspace infringement was mere seconds.
Turkey is a terrorist state.  Time to kick them out of Nato and let Russia get in there and clean house.
As a turkish, We should have been more calm and more wise than Russia. Russia made wrong to us but we had need to calm down and had escorted them to out of borders. We are not strong as such as russia . even we are right, we do not have power enough to show ourselves as right in this situtation as russia. Our government have should known that. Putin will take it and play with it how he will want. People think putin bomb isis but he does not actually. This last event proves it but because of down of  russian jet, no one will think about it. Sad..
If Russia declares war we (US) need to back them. We need a strong ally in the coming violent future.
Hey kids, back when I was younger there was a county named "Turkey". Don't ask about what happened...
If Russian jets received 10 warnings then invaded U.S. Airspace you can be damned sure we would shoot it down.  I feel remorse for the pilots but this was Russia's fault. 
''I gave the order myself....bitch''
Sorry, but can someone please ELI5 why this is such a stupid thing to say? He's telling Russia and the world that it was his decision, not some accident or some rebellious subordinate, that they shot down that plane. He's telling Russia that, after numerous warnings, they can't violate Turkish airspace without consequences. I mean, it's tough talk, and could certainly lead to some pretty serious consequences, but what else should he say? It was an accident? 
turkey violates greek airspace, noone cares

russians violate turkey airspace, shoot to kill

bit of hypocracy there turkey, might want to practice what you preach?
Well at least he admits it. Unlike Russia, who shadily went into Crimea without flags on their uniforms.
The evidence confirms this was no accident. Erdogan's own statements regarding the handling of airspace violations prior to the incident and his statement afterwards are direct contradictions.
Turkey is an awful country. Radical Islamist apologists.
This guy has balls
The idea that a NATO country is supposed to allow Russian bombers over their territory without permission is absurd. 


It doesn't matter at all what the bomber's mission was--whether it was bombing Turkmen rebels or ISIS or rescuing 100 starving children from a village.
Once again it is astounding how quickly people have forgotten that Russia has been waging a war in Ukraine for what is coming up on two years now AND has annexed a major chunk of the country just because they got a fucking bomber shot down while it was invading Turkey's airspace.

Is Turkey an incredibly fucked up country? Yeah, but should we railroad them and coddle Russia? Hell no, fuck both of their governments as they're both corrupt and support terrorist nations. Putin is just crying crocodile tears when his soldiers were indeed in the wrong. 
So convenient when you can get your big brother NATO to fight your fights. Turkey in general is playing with fire, Putin is getting hungry &amp; Christmas is right around the corner... They constantly violate other nations airspace etc. To me it looks like Turkey doesn't want that ISIS oil flow to stop anytime soon and Russia is committed at shutting it down.
RIP Turkey
Wow, so many propaganda bots from Russia in action. Amazing.
Heading towards World War III

Must Read !!!

After World War II people around the world thought that it was last major war on Earth. This does not look appearing now.
In 1944 major countries of world sat in New Hampshire(Bretton wood conference) to declare dollar as a world currency backed by gold(Gold Standard).US had reserve gold to print paper money.US started printing money and was enjoying the economy boom. From 1945 to 1965 everything was fine but in 1965 US had war with Vietnam and in effect of war US economy started tumble. Until 1970 US was printing more and more dollar to overcome financial crisis. This made countries to start disbelieving in dollar and asking for gold in return of dollar.US had printed more dollar than gold it had. Redeem of gold would have destroy US economy. There fore, US president Nixon ended gold back dollar and started printing more and more dollar to strengthen the economy.Dollar value in international markte was gradually plunging as it was only paper money not backed by gold. Nixon took very smart move, went to Arab and asked to take dollar in exchange of oil. US also promised to give protection and weapons(This is called Petro-Dollar system). This was first seed sow for current war. Other OPEC members (Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar,United Arab Emirates and Venezuela) also followed Arabia exchange policy. US economy started emerge but other countries(China and Japan etc) had to make export oriented policy to get dollar to purchase oil.US economy is like a vehicle which can not run without oil.

In 1999 enemy of dollar had come into the picture "Euro". In 2000 Iraqi president(Russia-China pro) Saddam Hussain decided to sell oil in Euro and assured death warrant of him. US economy(dollar) might derail if Iraq and other OPEC members follow it.
In 2003 Bush invaded Iraq pretending of chemical weapons to save their dollar and destroy the entire country. Iraq again started selling oil in dollar. 
Libya's Gaddafi declared to use gold Dinar for oil in 2010. He also tried to form African union and was planning to launch a satellite which was going to serve African nations. Gaddafi step was against US and European nations who have been sucking entire Africa continent for years. So US and EU invaded Libya and killed Gaddafi. Syria moved away from the dollar in 06 and Iran in 08.

Now US has to keep Russia and China away from natural resources(oil and natural gas) and has to compete Euro/Yuan/Rubel as well. Today the US-backed wars in Ukraine and in Syria are but two fronts in the same strategic war to cripple Russia and China and to rupture any Eurasian counter-pole. Natural gas has become the favored “clean energy” source for the 21st Century and the EU is the world’s largest growth market for gas, a major reason US wants to break the Russia-EU supply dependency to weaken Russia and keep control over the EU via loyal proxies like Qatar.

The world’s largest known natural gas reservoir sits in the middle of the Persian Gulf straddling part in the territorial waters of Qatar and part in Iran.China signed agreement with Iran to develop gas pipeline infrastructure to bring the gas to China .In July 2011, the governments of Syria, Iran and Iraq signed an historic gas pipeline energy agreement and this triggered US-Saudi-Qatari war to remove Syrian president Assad. This pipeline would run from the Persian Gulf(in Iran), to Damascus in Syria via Iraq territory. The agreement would make Syria the center of assembly and production in conjunction with the reserves of Lebanon. This is a geopolitically strategic space that geographically opens for the first time, extending from Iran to Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.

Shortly after signing with Iran and Iraq, on August 16, 2011, Bashar al-Assad’s Syrian Ministry of Oil announced the discovery of a gas well in the Area of Qarah in the Central Region of Syria near Homs. Russia, with Assad in power, would be a major investor or operator of the new gas fields in Syria.
Iran ultimately plans to extend the pipeline from Damascus(Syria) to Lebanon’s Mediterranean port where it would be delivered to the huge EU market. 
Syria would buy Iranian gas along with a current Iraqi agreement to buy Iranian gas from Iran’s part of South Pars field.

Qatar, today the world’s largest exporter of LNG, largely to Asia, wants the same EU market that Iran and Syria eye. 
For that, they would build pipelines to the Mediterranean. Here is where getting rid of the pro Russian-Iranian-Chinese Assad is essential. 
In 2009 Qatar approached Bashar al-Assad to propose construction of a gas pipeline from Qatar’s north Field through Syria on to Turkey and to the EU. 
Assad refused, citing Syria’s long friendly relations with Russia. 

That refusal combined with the Iran-Iraq-Syria gas pipeline agreement in 2011 ignited the full-scale Saudi and Qatari along with US assault on Syria and cause of rise of ISIS. ISIS is now war army of US+Israel+Saudi Arabia+Qatar and many other countries. US announced attack on ISIS but wanted to capture Syria. Now in counter attack Syrian president called his alliance Russia and China. 

Now world is on the verge of polarisation, Russia+China+Iran+Syria+Iraq... and US+Israel+Saudi Arabia+Qatar+UK...

US is trying to rapture EU economy to down euro using IMF by weaken its member countries economies. Greece is one of the victim recently(Spain, Italy, Portugal are in queue).

Saudi Arabia is manipulating oil price to weaken Iran indirectly Russia. China is in currency war with US. China did de-value its currency to compete with dollar(China market crash in Aug-Sept).

France voted against Israel for Palestine in UN in Sept-Oct 2015, recognized as a state and stabbed to Israel, and looking for 2 states solution theory.
France had to pay for this by #AttackinParis

China is capturing African countries and making lot of investment. Mali is recently attacked because its President went to china door to ask help and get rid of US occupied gold mines.

Tayiip "Abu Bakr" Erdogan
Dead man talking.
 This is the same government that continues to deny the Armenian Genocide, 100 years later. If you expected them to be amicable and exemplary... well, damn.
A lot of people may find this offensive... I however... find it pretty friggin funny

Good.  Putin is a cunt and he was bombing civilians/moderate rebels in an area ISIS isn't in.

His military is shit, his weapons are shit and any serious challenge by NATO would see Putin dead in a week.  

(Now paid Kremlin trolls and /r/conspiracy useful idiots will downvote)
Alright now it's starting to look like turkey is just a bunch of assholes trying to start shit
Does anyone know what Russia will be having for Thanksgiving?
They contacted the pm within the fifteen seconds between the warning and when the missile was fired? Nonsense posturing.
when putin repays the favor, I think he'll use the same words...with a smug grin
Fuck this guy. 
I'll just leave this here.

Just some food for thought:
Learn to do basic math. Turkey's statement to UN: 1.15 miles / 17 seconds x 60 x 60 = 243 miles/hour = 391 km/hour
When calculating the distance flown and the amount of time allegedly spent in Turkish airspace, some have attempted to determine the aircraft’s flight speed. According to those numbers, the Su-24 would have had to be flying at stall speed.

RIP
I mean, I know times are different and all, but didn't Russia/USSR shoot down a fucking civilian jet headed to South Korea one time? 
well time to bomb his house back into the stone age
Makes the Turkish version even less credible.
This is the same guy who said that "There's a 360 degree difference between Turkish Islam and ISIS". (https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3ovmc3/foreign_policy_turkish_prime_minister_there_is_a/) 
The Turkish PM thinks he can not be touched with the backing of NATO. Now the possible coalition is most likely fucked. Thanks Turkey
Turkey, what the fuck
Do you want WW3? Cause this is how you get WW3.
This proxy war is fascinating.
Nothing else to expect from this underdeveloped piece of s country. They are bombing the Kurds while IS are burying children and women alive. They are the same like IS in mind, and aspire the same goal, they just don't say it openly.
Can the Turkish people just decide to give up the PM to the Russians 

"Sorry we shot your planes down, just kill this guy. It was all him"
So America isn't the only one cooking Turkey this holiday?
Do you want to piss off Putin?

Because this is how you piss off Putin.
This is the same government that till this day denys the Armenian Genocide...
What did you really expect?
Shots fired!
Erdogan has isis peen so far down his throat that he had to sign language the orders.
I thought the plane was in their airspace for 17.5 seconds. It's almost as if they wanted the opportunity to shoot it down. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm with Russia on this one.
Turkey + Saudi Arabia + Qatar + USA = ISIS

#collectingcapsalready #fallout5
The sexual tension between these two is really awkward. They need to just admit that they like each other and get a room already.
Daesh just got itself into a fortunate Warhammer40K kind of situation:

"You can never have too many enemies. The more you've got, the more likely they are to get in each other's way."
Unlike other countries, Turkey actually has the balls to call out Russia's bluff.
It's weird as an American to be on Russia's side for all of this. Turkey now seems to be working with ISIS and the US just sits back and let's this happen. We got a bad president who knows nothing about foreign policy and it's hurting America big time.
Given the choice between Russia and Turkey, I choose Russia, they may be assholes now and then, but they are our kind of assholes.
Why is Turkey in NATO anyway?  They don't seem to be too close an ally
"The plane was in turkish airspace for 17 seconds" i can't be the only one that doesn't think it was justified
The anti-Turkish/pro-Russian comments here show how stupid we in the West are. Anything that goes against the official line is opposed, as if we are rebellious teenagers. Putin's propaganda is working mightily fine, and his hybrid war shows this.

A few things need to be cleared:

1) This was not the first time Russia invaded Turkish airspace. It has done so numerous times in the last few weeks and Turkey EXPLICITLY warned Russia that the next time it happened, they would shoot the offending jet down.

2) Turkey complaining about Russia's bombing of ethnic Turkmen is perfectly valid and justified, not some random excuse they pulled out, as some idiots are saying. Turkey complained to the U.N. about this a few weeks ago and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's meeting in Turkey (which he cancelled) was supposed to focus on this very issue.

3) Russia has been deliberately provoking Turkey. The first time they invaded Turkish airspace 4 weeks ago, the Russian pilot actually locked on to a Turkish patrol jet, signalling he intended to shoot the Turkish jet down, for five entire minutes! Imagine, you accidentally invade someone's airspace and then you signal to their patrols that you will shoot down their jets by locking your missile on to them. It's absurd.

4) To those whining "IT WAS ONLY FOR 17 SECONDS", you have to remember the Russian jets were warned while they were approaching the border. They had plenty of time to react, but they didn't even respond to the warnings.

5) We know now, for a fact, that Russia has lied about not being warned by the Turks. The audio recordings of the Turks warning the Russian invaders has been released, from multiple sources, and the warnings were heard by other American pilots and Dutch civilian plane pilots, who both said the warnings were met with no response from the Russians, despite being warned ten times. This begs the question: why would Russia lie? Hmmmmm, do Crimea, Ukraine and MH17 come to mind? 

Hybrid warfare folks, it's all about the information war.
And the Ruskies seem to be winning on Reddit at least.



How hard is it for people to understand you warn someone before they enter your territory not while you are in there?
Well, it's nice that you're micro-managing bro.
Good for them! At least some good came out of this, what with the education on disease prevention and better hygiene. Hopefully this staves off another epidemic from happening.
Did anyone ever read about how victims who got treated may actually have the virus dormant in their eyes or in genital parts? I should go find that article. But thats great this thing is getting beat.
So much for the world ending. Looks like i no longer have to move to Madagascar

Now that we know that Ebola can be transmitted sexually for up to a year after the initial infection, can any country really declare that they are free of Ebola quite yet?
God some of these comments are obnoxious. I think this is great news.
Guinea is now the only country in the world that hasn't been declared Ebola-free yet, according to Wikipedia.
I wish every success to those who are working on the prevention of ebola through vaccination. I hope the world continues to help Sierra Leone as it will need this to recover after such a blow.
I give it a few months tops until it reemerges as an STD again.
Much gratitude and respect to all those healthcare workers.
I'm glad he's finally cured. I loved The Good, the Bad and The Ugly
Yeah.......still not going there.  Ever.
Great news. For the people saying it's too soon, no country declared Ebola free has yet had Ebola re-emerge.
Whoa! Whoa! Positive, happy news? England, you know you can't do that. It's supposed to be fear mongering sensationalism.  
This should also be on /r/upliftingnews
...For now
Time beat Mass Hysteria, good job Time
[SERIOUS] in sierra leone currently. if you have any questions or would like to know something shoot me a private message and ill be happy to answer.
Seems like the WHO and other health based NGOs know what they're doing even if many news outlets tried their hardest to make them look incompetent. 

Great news to see Sierra Leone is free of the disease for now (could come back West, but at least now there's more awareness of ebola there)
Congrats to Sierra Leone on being Ebola free.  Now only if we could say the same for Twitch chat.
I bet I can fix that.

Their enthusiasm in celebrating is infectious. 
Didn't that British nurse have a relapse? Seems like people who "recovered" can suffer long term problems and may even still carry the virus.
Nope... Still hiding in the semen of men. It's about to be reclassified as an STD. http://arstechnica.com/science/2015/10/ebola-is-now-a-std/
Good for them. Fuck that Ebola shit
That's awesome for them! Glad to hear they can get a little peace after that hell.
I participated in the Ebola vaccine drug trial that has helped make this possible.  :)
The model/pr0n star had EBOLA?
Too soon, best give it a good year or so, rather than a few weeks. As we know Ebola is still in the person, even when they are well.
Ebola is pretty much everywhere don't you know?
Now the world can get back to being hysterical about climate change. I miss the 1980s when we just had the AIDS epidemic to worry about.
dont tell the government that their virus is being defeated!!! FOOLS! ALL OF U!!
Eh, Ebola will flare up again. It's a sleeper killer 
It doesn't mean much, it is alive in reservoir hosts like bats.
Huzzah!

Based on our understanding at the peak of the epidemic, I wonder what the statistical probability was of this being the outcome, versus, say, civilization-wrecking global catastrophe.
Based on my lack of geographical knowledge I congratulate him
Good job guys, finally some good news in the world
They made the best video games in the 90's.

Glad things are getting better for them.
good. a fistful of dollars is one of my favorite movies.
That's great, but to bad the illicit gems trade aka 'blood diamonds' continues to torture, and disrupt so many lives. All so she can show and tell her friends what a great fiancé you are.
Cautiously optimistic here.   
Yeah except any one who knows anything about virus infections know that you don't become magically free of the virus. You know about that routine visit from the herps you get? Or the genital wart you still find years after being cured? Well thems be virii.
Including known reservoirs like eyeballs and semen?
Good for her!
Sierra Leone? is that a porn star?
Seems like only yesterday the whole world was in panic mode about the end of the world. How time flies...
Yay! EbolaFreetown

Am happy for them now the sierra leoneans need to make sure.Ebola stays outside their country don't be complacent.
Just in time! I'll be there in two months.
Hey everyone! Let's all go to Sierra Leone now.... Guys?
Remember the panic over ebola? that was fun 
What about all the other shit
I love sunny leone. 
Time to vacation!
I always wondered if Nicholas Cage got AIDS there or not! She was sketchy at best. 
So... the prayers worked?
Came here for the southpark jokes about gluten free ebola, guess not :/
Didn't know she was sick. Glad she's okay.

Edit: got confused with former adult star Sunny Leone.
I actually read "Sunny Leone has been declared officially Ebola free"
I misread that as "Sunny Leone...." and it came across very different 
Luckily for them Ebola burns out it's victims so fast that it can't spread to a huge amount of people before it's noticed.
Free Ebola!
Without a vaccine?
Ebola free is the way to be!
Wow public health officials really did it. That's pretty insane how quickly that was
I remember when my wingnut Facebook friends all thought that Obama was going to bring it to America so he could declair martial law. 
So am I
I love his movies.
That's just what Ebola wants you to think. 
Ok
On an unrelated note. The population of sierra leona has extinct
It's not gone, because it lingers on the tissues of survivors; they at the very least will suffer long term sequelae and at minimum have continuing effect on the public health burdens of the country.  

If the virus lurks, it will return.  It's not gone.  It's just quiet.
I first read Shia LaBeouf
Plot twist: because everyone died of ebola.
Sweet now I can finally buy a plane ticket there.
Now if we can just get them to tone down the constant machete murder and ethnic cleansing I think we'll finally be able to get the Russians to get serious about buying all those diamonds they've got. 
Seemingly.
don't eat the bush meat!

We did it Reddit!
until tomorrow.
[We did it](http://imgur.com/hQlAxlz)
bad news 
they need more ebola and aids and malaria 
Wow...well done Sierra Leone!

Now stop eating weird meat.
Very happy for my country!!! Ebola fucked this place up. There is a strong belief here that ebola was tested on this country as a weapon, and with ebola research taking place here before the outbreak and illegal stashes of harvested organs being discoved at the airport oh and not to mention the 5 billion dollars sent here of which 4.7 billion is missing and unaccounted for, i dont blame anyone. All i can say is im glad its over.
Oh shit. I forgot Ebola was even a thing. This is awesome!
Who the hell would pay for Ebola in the first place?!
Madagascar not buying that shit.
Just because you're clean doesn't mean others are. Always wrap your country before having sex with other countries. 
Sierra Leone still not declared Sierra Leone free 
It was always a hyped-up bullshit story. From day 1.
I think that this could be a great labeling gimmick. "Coke zero,  now ebola free!" 



Edit: aww c'mon guys!  It's kinda funny,  isn't it?  I mean...  Isn't it?

Great! Now their only problem is everything else. 
When I see a headline like this I wonder if there is some political motivation in it.  It seems like everything is politicised in some way. I seems to soon to declare this.

I don't know why but I read that as "Shia Labeouf" instead of Sierra Leone.
Yay!

I'm glad David Duchovny can rest well now, knowing his ex-wife is disease free.
Finally got that last disease cube out of there.
Until next week
We did it, guys
Okay but why are we worried about one woman, don't we have a mass outbreak to worry about?
They reversed up the words, they're actually selling "free ebola"

I'LL TAKE TWENTY.
Free Ebola here! Get your free Ebola here!
I bet Ebola is glad to be out of that dump roll snare drum. 
Another miracle cure from the White Man
If God sent the AIDS virus because of his hatred of homosexuality, then it's pretty obvious with the Ebola virus he's not too keen on blacks either.

Well that wasn't hard. The Ebola scare was a scam to begin with.
It just emphasises the ludicrous decision to host a World Cup here. FIFA are such a corrupt organisation.
Calling this "labor exploitation" is a euphemism. It's virtual slavery, and it's been going on for longer than just the past five years.
Qatar is the worst possible host for the World Cup. Not only because of their horrendous human rights record, and their status as a slave-state, but because logistically it's a nightmare. Summer temperatures in Qatar easily reach 50 degrees ˚C (America, that's 122 degrees Fahrenheit) making football unplayable unless you don't care about the health and safety of the players, which is why they're moving it to the winter. A winter World Cup would clash with the European league schedules. Not only that, but it would also mess with the Super Bowl. Fox, which owns the broadcast rights to both the WC and the SB is really pissed off at FIFA, because if they air at the same time, both would lose revenue. Fans who would've normally watched both are now going to be split. What really sucks is that any meaningful opposition to FIFA and Qatar is going to come from those reasons, rather than humanitarian ones.

Edit: The World Cup would air from November-December. The Super Bowl is fine.
I hope there's a movement for fans to boycott the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. I for sure won't be watching, even though I'm just a drop in the bucket.
Seriously, just Fuck Them. Fuck their slavery and disregard for human life. Fuck their funding of dodgy Islamic groups. Fuck their abhorrence of homosexuality. Fuck their desert and the idea of playing football in it. Fuck the fact that you can't buy alcohol on a stopover in Doha. Fuck the fact it feels like a sauna even at midnight. Fuck PSG. Fuck Platini. And Fuck their vagina shaped stadia.
slavery in plain-view.


too bad no one actually truly cares enough about qatar to make a difference.  i mean sure youll read a thread or post about it, make u feel bad, n then youll post it somewhere else thinking youve done your part in "raising awareness"
and here i am, being just as helpful as everyone else.
Good thing all of you are still going to watch the World Cup, otherwise they might lose money and actually have to face some consequences.
I was in Doha last week for my first trip to Qatar. After 4 years in the UAE, I expected more of the same, but I was shocked at the lack of safety protocols. I saw people working on scaffolds without helmets. Or posted safety information, contact people (accountability)  Not very well organized.
Watching this tournament is supporting slavery.
Yeah and how 'bout all them refugees they're taking in...
6 years is enough time for another country to be chosen and prepare.  Grow some balls and take it away from them.
America just sent their top Electric Engineer, Ahmed Muhammed, to Qatar to straight things out. Just wait until you see the clock at the World Cup. Jaws will drop
\#BoycottQatar
Why would they change? It's not like FIFA is going to cancel the World Cup. 
Can't we all just not watch? I mean, I love me some futbol but it can't be that hard to find something else to do.
Countries on the Arabian peninsula actually encourage labour exploitation. Most of the labourers there are from impoverished South Asian countries. They are required to surrender their passports to work. They are allowed to have very little communication with their families and home governments. So they find it very difficult to get out even if they wanted to. This hasn't changed the number of poor people wanting to work there though because the recruiters paint a VERY rosy picture. The cousin of a friend's friend went to Qatar/Oman (I don't remember which one) to work as a crane operator and was never seen or heard of again. It's just slavery in my opinion.
Would it be fair to call this situation modern-day slavery? I mean you can't leave the country again without approval from your boss, who holds onto your visa for you...
...surprising absolutely nobody. 
I hate seeing multiple posts about the Qatar situation and it angers me so much that humans actually do these things. People are evil, man.
If you point out to someone on the highway that they have a flat tire, they'll pull over and deal with it. And thank you for pointing it out.

That's because they didn't know and they don't want to drive like that.

Qatar knows what the fuck is going on and that's how they want it. They don't intend on doing anything about it. They want people to stop looking. 

It's the fucking middle east. Life is cheap and shit. Importing guys from India and Bangladesh, willing to work in 100 degree heat all day long fully clothed and that's the *good* treatment. Treating these guys worse ... worse than ... there's no worse treatment than being a foreign laborer in a middle eastern Islamic country. Can't say "worse than dogs" because we don't treat dogs like that.

Want to make a difference?

Stop watching anything related to football/soccer. Don't buy gear. Don't go to the games. Don't involve yourself in this sport that is supporting this crap.

Of course nobody will do that.

I don't understand this situation. I thought there was proof the bid was won with bribe money. I thought there was proof that it was going to be too hot to host a world cup there anyway, and I also thought there was solid proof that workers are dying to complete these venues. Then I also swore I saw that they were probably going to remove their bid.

Well, what the hell happened? Just another case of the world being outraged at a tragedy, doing a bunch of talking, but never resolving anything???
Oh man what a surprise /s
Screw FIFA! What about the Syrian Refugees?
No shit.
Does anyone honestly think that FIFA cares about such things?  A more corrupt and self-serving organization may exist, but I haven't seen evidence of it yet.
Did some idiots actually expect that they would?  Please they are an entitled, self indulgent and self righteous gem of the Muslim world.  They can do no wrong and owe nothing to our Western standards and expectations.  Welcome to the real world.
How about people just don't watch the world cup in 2022? Would it be that fucking hard? Really? To boycott something you know is vehemently immoral?

People are so fucking weak.
If hosting a large sporting event doesn't solve their problems, I don't know what will.
WTF did they expect?  Corrupt agencies pick corrupt countries.  If they really want it to stop, they need to pull the games and go somewhere else with it.
"almost nothing", what about that coca-cola commercial? That really made me feel good about the whole situation.
I hear slavery is pretty popular there. Did I hear wrong?
But those Coke ad's we all upvoted..SOMETHING WAS SUPPOSE TO CHANGE !!!
i dont even understand how this is legal much less accepted by FIFA and other nations
Fifa selection process

Q: we want the world cup! 
SB: and could you point yourselves out on this map, here?
Q: sure! Just south of that war - ry bit, right under this pile of money.
SB: we have deal! 
Nothing will change. Slavery-loving soccer fans will watch as enthusiastically as ever. The beat goes on. 
Boycott the World Cup. Do not watch, do not participate, do not read or buy any of the promotional material. It is the only way to stop this happening in the future.

Edit: Typo
After working in the UAE - it's not just because of FIFA. The cheap labor there is exploited to no extent and they keep crossing the border. Most of the workers I was around were from India where they were making penny's a day and would do anything to leave. Most of the expats told stories of how contracting companies would take the passports from he workers so they couldn't leave, even if they wanted to.
Remember how the peasants were treated in Europe/Russia by royalty around the 1500's? Yeah, that's pretty much the middle east now with their imported labor.
It also funds ISIS and other known Islamic extremist groups.  Go figure.
I can't wait till we stop relying on oil and the entire Middle East goes back to a bunch of camel-riding primitives we won't have to care about anymore.
Qatar is the country of the greedy capitalist.
And yet people still support Al Jazeera and AJ America because they can "separate" who is behind it from the content. God damn. 
How could anyone even trust these stadiums to be stable?

Or their government to provide adequate security?
This sounds like someone really thought the Al Thanis would watch (they hate to read!) a critical documentary about their fucked up country and go »holy shite Jassim, we need to stop this terrible exploitation of 3rd world labour and act like proper muslims!«. 
They probably bribed themselves to say my uncle was fucked for ~ 5-10 years.
"*Chosen*"
And why would they?  Not like anything bad will happen to them if they don't.  Their country will still be an even bigger shit hole than it already is after FIFA packs it's bags and leaves.
Has the world given them a reason to change? Didn't think so. Keep that spice flowing.
Probably because they don't give a shit, and nothing bad will happen to them, so it's doubtful they will ever care. 
So the reformed laws *just* went into effect, and not completely. It'll be interesting to see what happens after it has been in effect for some time.
Qatar's explanation is probably "But the stadium isn't done yet! D:"
Having been to Doha, it's a fucking shithole. How they were given the World Cup is beyond me. I've expected something along the lines of Abu Dhabi, but the center of Doha is just a dump. And new neighborhoods are without public spaces and half-finished. 
So, are we going to not watch the world cup?  If this is slavery (holding pay for workers, withholding passports, subhuman conditions), then do we watch?
&gt; The ~~kafala~~ slavery system currently only allows workers to leave the country or switch jobs with the approval of their employer, and this will not change after the reform comes into force.

FTFY, BBC. 

Call a spade a god-damned fucking spade, BBC.  Who gives a shit what they call it? Kafala is slavery. To call it anything else is an injustice to those suffering and dying every day for a game where 22 men kick a ball in a field of freshly mowed grass for an hour and a half.  Fuck FIFA for choosing it, fuck the Qatari business that use slavery, and fuck the BBC for not having the balls to say what is actually occurring there.   
Big surprise.  Many countries in the world give zero-fucks.
"We're all very surprised by this"

- Nobody ever
Isn't the bigger issue with FIFA and choosing these countries with horrible humans rights records to host the world cup? Honestly, Qatar should have never been awarded the games, unfortunately its more about whose pockets you can line than who is actually the best suited nation.
Surprise surprise. Cancel it now.
"Chosen"
And no country is taking back their participation.... so we are ok with it, right?
It's fine, we'll all be dead by ISIS by then anyway.
You expect a bunch of Arabs to follow directions?
Done nothing to end it? I'm sure they've expanded the system. The slaves are the ones building the stadiums and infrastructure. 
Fuck Ahmed and his clock.
I know we won't be missed for our footballing ability, but I wish England would boycott it.
Too late for this reply. Fuck Qatar, FIFA and alll the conniving cunts allowing this shit
Corrupt FIFA working with host countries that are literally murdering people to get a little international recognition. All for a soul-crushingly boring sport made up of puny men that flop when touched accidentally. Oh, and their fans are violent tribal goons. Yay, go soccer!

"those people are losers" - Donald Trump 
"We should host the World Cup in Qatar."

"But they have slavery and the result could be thousands of dead people"

"It's cool, nobody will do anything".

True story. 


That's the status quo in Qatar and the UAE in general. They use foreign slave labor even though they manage to skate away from the actual slave designation, but that's still what they are in all but name.

You can't expect a shithole with wall to wall religious fundamentalists to change their ways quickly, or indeed at all. 

Basically, they're all barbarians down there and should be kept separate from humanity until they're potty trained.
Well apparently Amnesty International hasn't done shit either 
Someone should have the UN Human Rights council investigate this for some real comedy.
Well why would they? There is no pressure on them. McDonalds and Coca-Cola threatening to pull out if they didn't improve was laughable...these sponsors arn't gonna do shit.
If FIFA wanted too, could they change the host city for 2022 or are they locked in with Qatar?
Amnesty International? Isn't it one of the most useless organization?
Why the fuck would they? No ones gonna take the game away from them. They haven't and are unlikely to be internationally sanctioned for what is effectively institutionalized slave labor. And we've long since established that FIFA is a soulless inhuman machine whose only purpose is to sell footballs and football accessories 
Should have never been "chosen" in the first place 
Neither have the companies whose mobile phones you're using, don't see you boycotting Apple Samsung HTC etc. 
Double standards
I passed through Qatar on my way to India earlier this year. We had an 8-hour layover in Doha, during which we were allowed to leave the airport on a government-approved tour. 

They took us to the "old" marketplace, which was built in 2006. Then, they took us to the yacht harbor and Maserati/Bentley dealerships and the mall in order to show off their desert money, which is about all there is in that pop-up city.

Doha and Qatar suck.
Of course not.  Fuck Qatar.  Fuck FIFA.  And while we're at it, Fuck Saudi Arabia.  
It's awesome in Qatar... as long as you're not a slave. So for pretty much everyone here, you'll have an awesome time in Qatar.
Honestly, neither have we.
They have "fuck you" money
Well with all the repercussions and real world consequences... oh wait... nevermind.
What a fucking surprise.
real life subplot from the "hunger games". Take down the Capital. 

I love the World Cup and soccer, but jeez. Not at this expense. Unacceptable. Boycott WC 2022. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbdr57V-s80

Thx for that! Pretty much all said what has to be said about beloved Sepp Blatter.....
Why should it? Chronic labor exploitation is necessary to finish building the stadium.
hey cut them some slack, it's almost nothing, not absolutely nothing. That's progress right there.
Why should they improve?  Their lack of standards/humanity is being well-rewarded.
And that split in the rules or not, there's potential for it to the winter.
Sadly, I'm sure most people will forget about all the blood with which the stadiums were built with and will break their piggybanks to visit that horrible country.
See you in 2022!!! Nothings going to change. Time to stock up on your battery operated fans. 
that's because slavery is still acceptable in the third world
Cue the simultaneous, worldwide collective sarcastic gasp in 3, 2, 1...now.
Stadiums built with slave labor and some people are still surprised about the corruption within FIFA
They have no pressure to do so. I've been there and seen the construction projects and I'm not surprised. Why is it even there at all it's a desert!!! It's like 120 there in the summer hence why I visited my friend in Qatar in December. And if you have the World Cup in winter that'll fuck up premier league champions league and so on. Should have been in the us.
more from the *"no shit sherlock"* files after this....
Well thoses stadiums won't build themselves....
I'm shocked.

How amazing would it be if at the last minute all the big countries just pulled out of played.
That area of the world- never does anything effective to improve any kind of exploitation, injustice or hypocrisy 
Did Amnesty really thought the Gulf States will stop enjoying the "benefits" of slave labour just because we keep trying to pretend they are advanced nations because skyscrappers and shit?
and we're shocked because...
They've already paid their bribe to FIFA, so I think they've earned it.
Neither has anyone else. Sponsors, participating nations, qatar is at fault but they were empowered.
Is anybody really suprised? Have these folks not been reading the news concerning cheap foreign labor in the Middle East for the last ten years and the subsequent human rights violations.

Cant expect a country to change it's culture just cause white people are rolling in.
But still gunna host the world cup there in 2022...


Fucking really? If you cared, do something. Otherwise game on.
Please please take it somewhere else. Oh pretty please. 
corruption
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here! 
I get the US have reason to be allied to Qatar, but sometimes I really doubt it's worth it.
Why don't the players boycott?

I don't follow soccer (just watch the USA matches during the WC), but I'm surprised all of these influential, big-named athletes haven't unionized to boycott this.

Could someone ELI5 to someone who knows nothing about the sport?
Is anyone else doing anything about it?  If no country or powerful organization does anything to stop it, then why would Qatar?  IF countries start announcing they won't attend or televise the world cup, if all the sponsors start pulling out, then maybe something will get done. If articles come out about it, and every gets enraged, then does nothing, then of course Qatar won't change. 
Can we just move the World Cup already?
Qatar was "chosen"? 
Messi will be new superstars but people will forget about all the more hot for the world cup?
I'm shocked. That is shocking.
And still nothing will change. Too many corrupt people have too much money to lose 
It's not like trusting Amnesty International is a good idea.

The group has declared numerous times that human trafficking and prostitution is a "human right"
Of course they haven't. Why would they? The rich Gulf Arab states don't give a shit about PR. Are you going to stop buying gas for your car because of how they treat immigrant labor? Is the world going to stop buying their oil?
At the end of the day. If people carry on buying tickets to or watching FIFA events, nothing will change. And you know not enough people will stop watching FIFA events to make a difference. 
"chosen"
No surprises there. 

I hope FIFA gets sued by all the other countries that have been traditionally excluded from hosting a World Cup because of their climate.
Color me shocked 
Boycott sponsors.
We boycotting the World Cup or just fussing online about slavery?  
I know it won't change anything but this is exactly why I don't plan to watch that world cup.
Why would they? They have money and FIFA is corrupt as fuck.
What a surprise...
Why would it?  Surely they need the labour exploitation now more than ever leading up to the games.
The world doesn't care about poor people, the fact that all of the world will still watch shows nobody gives two fucks.
Score another one for the Middle East. You guys just keep up the good work at being horrible
Why don't they move the Cup to Mexico?
I was thinking they got their right to host it revoked and FIFA cleaned themselves a bit. I guess I was totally wrong, the world is still a shitty place. 
However I don't want to face some consequences.
No shit.
Oh but Sepp Blatter says it is all okay. It is not. 
Are we shocked by this?
Qatar is doing little to curb human trafficking and slave labour. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_Qatar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSyInGUJ9Xk
In other news water is still wet. 
This is why I constantly boycott the Olympics, this is how it goes every time - it is a massive corporate money suck and corruption orgy masquerading as something humane. There isn't a shred of ethics in the whole institution.

Fuck them.
All it takes is one big country to back out and the rest will follow. Someone like a Germany or France even Brazil boycotting this event will cause the world to abandon it as well. 
World cup: always hosted in controversial areas where people ate suffering disproportionately
Nothing ever chances and nothing matters.

Those with the power to induce positive change already use their power to instill and maintain these destructive systems.

Sad.
I don't see why anyone has not simply said, "Shut it down" as part of all of the international corruption investigations into FIFA.  I get that other governments can't control what happens in Qatar but seems they can at least force FIFA to cancel the Qatar selection.  And additionally, put sanctions on Qatar though I can't imagine that would be received well by other ME countries...
This shouldn't be surprising, no one's given it a reason to do otherwise
I don't understand, America didn't Invade Qatar, whose fault is this disgusting behavior....

Some how the cis white males of America did this, I just know it
Why would they? They have a worldwide event to hold, they need more cheap labourers than ever before. Did AI expect them to need less? Doesn't make any sense.
will not watch
And this will change nothing. It will be business as usual and millions of people will spend ridiculous money there and nothing will ever change.
Why would they? It's not like there are any consequences.
Terrible, terrible. What is the culpability of the millions who will attend and watch the games?
Well, thank God Clock Boy and family no longer have to put up with America's evils and can enjoy the utopia that is Qatar.
Okay so how many hardcore soccer fans are not going to watch the 2022 World Cup? I have to admit I don't see many people I know not watching it, including myself. 
FIFA &amp; Qatar sitting in the tree.
K I L L I N G "migrant workers" in Glee.
Qatar, what a great place. They support let's see, slave labor, ISIS, every other ass backwards medieval practice that's predominant in that area. Anyone else sick of Arab bullshit?
why this is a surprise to anyone is beyond me. why the medieval countries quatar and SA are allowed to exist is also beyond me. 
And Qatar is the only country that does this?
Arabs have been in the slave trade longer than anyone. 

They're not going stop because some Amnesty hippy wrote a strongly-worded letter. 
And yet, the country continues to draw thousands upon thousands of new foreign workers each year.

Worker exploitation happens in every country in the west - why would anyone think it wouldn't happen in a middle eastern country?  As long as people continue to flock there, there is no incentive for change
When does FIFA save face and announce the move to Britain/The USA/Germany/France. Nations that have the stadia and infrastructure already in tact?
No shit. Slavery cultures don't change overnight. 

Just ask the American South. 
Curious to see how many heat strokes happen that year.
International embarrassment that the world community is doing nothing but talk about it.....if they even do that. 
Ya, well, everyones going to tune in like every other year.
I'm sure Qatar has thrown countless billions of dollars towards fixing this reputation issue
Nations like Qatar are institutionally and culturally unwilling and incapable of doing anything at all that helps poor lower class foreigners. 
How about we boycott it by not watching it? I'm an American, [so...](http://i.imgur.com/42wVOMl.gif)
Big secret, I know, but maybe just maybe the World Cup is all about money and not people.
you don't say...
Players need to boycott this World Cup. 
I love how they're changing it to winter time because of the heat, but that's going to conflict with the EPL and other leagues going on in Europe at that time.
Planning on boycotting the 2022 world cup unless it's location is moved to a civilized country
In other news; water is wet.


Seriously, this organisation is a cesspool of corruption and has a serious case of the fuckies.
It's a losing battle to try to get amoral people to start following some sort of reasonable guideline of human decency. The only option is some sort of punishment or sanction-- but that's not going to happen either. 

Telling them not to just treat people like animals is pretty much a symbolic gesture so that we don't have to take further action. 
"It's all right, money. As long as we have money, we'll always have money."
shh bby is ok
Football without pints in the pub?

Fuck this
Is this any surprise?
I hate seeing multiple posts about the whole slavery part should overshadow the logistics.
Are people really surprised by this? We've known that they've been shipping in Indians (and I think some Africans and Filipinos) for years to work the construction. 

Such a ludicrously blatant example of corruption...... 

There's a royal running for the presidency now too. Figures. I can only hope that because he's already loaded, he won't be so prone to accept bribes -- but in all likelihood, it'll probably boil down to just a rich man getting richer.
And why should they? It's not like anyone is actually going to punish them. A strongly worded letter will be the worst they get.
V n.  

What are we going to do, complain them into changing their systematic racist(ish) murder spree?
"chosen"
I mean... it's Qatar. What were you expecting, seriously?
Pirate Bay was simply a database with magnet links which could be searched. it didn't actually host much of anything.

Besides, a couple of years ago they made it so anyone could download the entire TPB database, which was about 500mb at the time I believe, so by now, tens of millions probably have it in their PCs. i don't think TPB can really be erased or shut down unless a meteorite shatters the planet or something.
I don't know why they have such a hard on for The Pirate Bay.  Is it the name?  Because there's several large torrent aggregators and hundreds, maybe thousands of small ones.  Not to mention all the pirated content that is directly shared via file hosts.

Regardless of your stance on IP and copyright, the act of trying to put a stop to it is not only impossible, but the measures needed to even slow it down are unacceptable by any free country's standards.

In the UK after they banned torrenting sites hundreds of free proxy websites started to show up. They banned the most popular ones, in response new ones popped up. Its a waste of resources, banning websites doesn't make a difference. Better to leave it be, piracy will always remain however difficult they make it.
Common sense prevailed. I'll admit I'm a little surprised.
Finally. It was just a waste of Swedish resources. Spending months trying to take it down, only for it to be put back up in an hour. Easier for everybody.
its funny  at the same time norwegian courts decided they could block piratebay, and when they tried they failed miserably 
Glad to see a court that understands the technological age.  If every website was held responsible for the actions of its users, the Internet as we know it would be long gone.  
in britain the government just bent over and blocked it on all isp.  so now i have to follow an extra link before i get there.
If the film industry wants to battle piracy, here's a simple blueprint for success:

* Release your movie on the same weekend around the world rather than weeks or months ahead of time in the US. If you don't do this, piracy will fill the gap in your level of service.
* Simultaneously release your movie as a streamable pay-per-view option when you release your movie in the theatres. People cannot logistically go to the cinema for every movie they watch. If you don't provide this option, piracy will fill the gap in your level of service.
* Stop calling your customers pirates and instead provide the level of service they expect and demand.
Time to download porn...for freedom!
Trying to ban stuff on the internet is stupid. Maybe in future everyone will automatically connect to a VPN by default.
Banning torrent sites made them multiple...
Not a good idea in the first place..
I've skimmed through the verdict and it's mostly one thing that this is based on: lack of evidence to find "B2 Bredband" particularly responsible for blocking TPB. 


The court repeats that TPB (referred to as "the service The Pirate Bay") do indeed contribute to criminal activity and hints that there might be a case in this. Why they decide to not rule for a blocking is mostly because, in this particular case against "B2 Bredband", lack of evidence on how many of the ISPs customers can be said to use the TPB to commit any copyright infringement. B2 argues that since the copyright holders haven't provided the court with any numbers on how many B2 customers uses "the service", it has to be assumed that it's very few based on some general estimatation (0.002% is mentioned by the court). The court also concludes that B2 have no self interest in TPB as such (access to the site doesn't directly provide them any additional profit). There is also a debate on the uncertainty about how much of the "content" on TPB is copyrighted and how much is free to share, but the court points out that the consider "almost all" to copyrighted.


The copyright holders wanted the ISP to block TPB by means of "DNS blocking" and "IP address blocking" and submits a long list of current *and past* domains and ip addresses used by TPB. B2 responds to this saying that they cannot commit to finding and blocking any news ways to access the TPB beyond what's printed in the court documents, and also reminds the court that blocking a IP address can cause damage to a third part (any site now using a former address). Since the court ruled against any blocking, they never really address the HOW. 


*This case is also about former site "swefilmer", but it's secondary and doesn't really play any significant part*


tl;dr It's not a policy verdict. 
[Cable Reveals Extent Of Lapdoggery From Swedish Govt On Copyright Monopoly - Falkvinge on Infopolicy](https://falkvinge.net/2011/09/05/cable-reveals-extent-of-lapdoggery-from-swedish-govt-on-copyright-monopoly/)

&gt;At the middle of this, we find the US cable [Stockholm 09-141](http://wikileaks.org/cable/2009/03/09STOCKHOLM141.html), recommending Sweden to not be blacklisted by the US on the so-called Special 301 list, and outlines why. The Special 301 is a list that the United States compiles every year that names and shames countries that haven’t been friendly enough to American industries. A majority of the world’s population is on the list, Canada and Spain among them. It’s quite nice company to be in, actually.

---

&gt;Since the 1980s, the US has aggressively threatened trade sanctions against countries who don’t give American companies sufficiently large competitive advantages — this is described in detail in the book Information Feudalism about the origins of the TRIPs agreement and WTO, for those interested in gory details. In practice, it works like this: industry associations in the US go to the Trade Representatives, who go to the myriad offices dealing with Foreign Policy, who go to the embassies, who talk to national governments (including the Swedish one) and demand changes to national law to benefit American corporations.

---

&gt;Now, these steps are written in copyright industry legalese. Some key words that sound harmless are cause for alarm once you recognize their meaning. Translated into ordinary language, this says:

&gt;* Adopt “Three Strikes” making it possible to disconnect prople from the internet without a trial (“injunctive relief“), and implement the IPRED directive in a way that the copyright industry can get internet subscriber identities behind IP addresses (which was not mandatory, my note).

&gt;* Prosecute to the fullest extent the owners of The Pirate Bay. (This doesn’t really need translation, except that it’s very noteworthy that the executive branch is ordered to interfere with the work of the judicial one, which is illegal in Sweden too.)

&gt;...
This is so dumb. It's not like my city would get sued for building and maintaining the roads that a couple bank robbers drove to and from the bank on. 
Glad Swedish court can understand what TPB is.
Norwegian courts ruled for the ban, but didn't stop anybody from accessing TPB:P

This is beginning to get stupid.. 
10 years later Swedish courts understand how the internet works
This was a district court ruling, so the case will probably be appealed. Big corporations such as these will never accept a precedent that conflicts with their interests.
In the UK after they banned torrenting sites hundreds of free proxy websites started to show up. They banned the most popular ones, in response new ones popped up. Its a waste of resources, banning websites doesn't make a difference. Better to leave it be, piracy will always remain however difficult they make it.

*****
&gt; Vilhelm Stokstad / TT. In a landmark decision, a Swedish court on Friday ruled that the country&amp;#039;s internet service providers cannot be forced to block controversial Swedish file-sharing site Pirate Bay.

&gt; After deliberating for almost a month on the closely-watched case, the District Court of Stockholm ruled that copyright holders could not make Swedish ISP Bredbandsbolaget block Pirate Bay.

&gt; In 2009 Fredrik Neij and three other Swedes connected with The Pirate Bay were found guilty of being accessories to copyright infringement by a Swedish court.

Yet another reason to join the Swedish.
in comes TPP and BLAMMO...gov'ts are forced to rule on behalf of corporations.
Now we just need the USA to learn a bit from other countries and stop ruining the lives of people who just want to listen to a song or see a movie
I've said it before and I'll say it again. You cannot defeat pirates through laws or punishments or code. They have and will **ALWAYS** find a way around it. There is only one way to defeat piracy and that is through making the paid option convenient enough to be worth the price


Why spend an hour trying to find a torrent for a niche game and then spend 3 hours downloading the torrent since it only has 4 people seeding it when for $5 you can get the game downloaded within twenty minutes, have access to multiplayer, and support the dev. THAT is how you defeat piracy.
I &lt;3 Sweden
yay for all you goody two shoes. Is no one here gonna pick upp their balls and tell the truth?

Well I start, I download pirated movies and games cuz im cheap and I´m getting away with it. Been doing that regularly for 10+ years now.
Wasn't Pirate Bay confiscated by the Swedish Government 7 years ago by the push of Hollywood in 2008? 
Just downloaded a Transexuals Farting Super Pack. Thanks PB!
considering that anyone who uses these naive fucking isps can just google pirate proxy and voila..... 100000000000000000000 mirrors.

you can't stop the internet you old fucking hollywood cocksucking dinosaurs.
If they banned piratebay, they would have to ban google too. cuz you use it to search for torrents which leads to leads which lets you download hosted content. they should also ban internet browsers for allowing you to access google chrome, oh and your PC for having a internet browser in the first place. In fact, they should make stores that sell PC's illegal.. just bang the world bro
Confiscating or taking down a domain is pretty worthless when you can try to go through hoops or waiting a full year before it's available in my bros car.
VICTOLY
Gotta Love bredbandsbolaget
I love Pirate bay!! 
Thank you sweden
I don't think that they could ban them even if they want. RuTracker.ORG (russian tracker) has published the database of all their torrents and it weighs only 4GB. If they ban one domain, pirate bay can create another and it's not a problem, cause it doesn't share any file. Pirate bay is not library, it's address book. 
Pirate Bay:1   Buzz Kills:0
What seems to get forgotten about in many discussions of the piracy of digital content is the law of Supply and Demand.

When demand is high and supply is low, prices are high.  When demand is low and supply is high, prices are low.  But digital content is in a unique place in the system; the supply is infinite but demand is always finite.

Let's look at it a different way, replacing 'digital content' with magic grapes.  Now magic grapes are a wonderful thing, because they are the tastiest grapes in the world and every time you pick a single grape from the vine, two more grow to replace it.  At first, these magic grapes would be worth a fortune and everyone would want some, but after a while enough people have enough grapes that they have more than they could ever eat.  The price of grapes begins to fall.  Once everyone has more grapes than they could ever eat, nobody would buy grapes any longer because they were everywhere and easy to get; the price has fallen to zero.

This is the situation we are now in with digital content.  There are more music and movies than we could ever consume available and countless more being released daily.  When the cost of reproducing content is zero and an infinite number of copies can be made, the law of supply and demand states the price should be near zero.

And yet, here we are, arguing with a handful of people (who have made millions or billions from the industry) about getting their fair share when they've been fleecing us the whole time, and are providing something we could get without them.
The judge is just a happy tpb user
Yo ho, Yo ho!
&gt; The Pirate Bay, which grew into an international phenomenon after it was founded in Sweden in 2003, allows users to dodge copyright fees and share music, film and other files using bit torrent technology, or peer-to-peer links offered on the site – resulting in huge losses for music and movie makers.

That's incredibly biased. 

Firstly, if the music industry had led the charge on technology and made music easily accessible then the Pirate Bay would not have been so successful.

Secondly, studies have shown that pirates actually spend MORE money on music than non-pirates. http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/21/study-finds-pirates-buy-more-music

Here's my attempt to FTFY:

&gt; The Pirate Bay, which grew into an international phenomenon after it was founded in Sweden in 2003, allows users to try music, film and other files for free before they buy. This has resulted in huge profit for the music and movie industry who didn't need to lift a finger or spend a penny to provide this service to their largest paying audience for digital sales.
Good
DAE Sweeden is hip like the cool kids!!!!
HAHAHAHAHAAHHAH Time to go download some games.
['arr!](http://events-media.nationalgeographic.com/media/images/photos/PIRATES_BDAY_inline.jpg)
YIFY needs to get his ass to sweeden. 
There's something vindicating and wonderful seeing these shmucks named as a losing side in the news today: "Universal Music, Sony Music, Warner Music, Nordisk Film and the Swedish Film Industry"
"Pirate Bay is blocked by many European ISPs"

That's cute, honestly don't know why anybody still bothers trying to get rid of it.
And why should they? The Pirate Bay is a good thing.
You can't censor the internet. I'm sorry to tell you, but censorship for profit will not work with the internet. The internet is not a simple medium like Television or Radio. The internet is a place of equality and freedom, where there are no rules. If one country tries to enforce regulations like this upon the entire internet, it will not succeed. It won't happen. The internet is the bane of censorship, and it always will be.
If this was China they'd be roasted for providing a safe haven for thieves. 

Once when I visited ars technica there were two articles on the front page about IP theft. One was about how the Swedes were proud of hosting pirate bay and the other one chastised China for IP piracy. The double standards were right there for everyone to see but I doubt anyone from the west noticed. You lot are so well indoctrinated.
This is a small step forward, but an important one.
Fuck yes. 
&gt; The Pirate Bay allows users to dodge copyright fees and share music, film and other files using bit torrent technology, or peer-to-peer links offered on the site – resulting in huge losses for music and movie makers.

See this is where the anti-pirating argument pisses me off. I pirate the odd movie and a lot of tv but I don't think my pirating them costs the content creators money. I already pay for the TV channels in my country which show the shows I am downloading, I just want to watch them in a time frame that suits me, especially for shows that I am highly invested in. I want to watch them asap so as to avoid spoilers through social media and news networks.

I go to the moves quite a bit. I see at least 10 movies a year at my local cinemas sometimes closer to 20. Most of the movies I download are ones that I saw at the movies that I want to watch one more time. Sure I could have bought it to watch, but again I am paying for almost every available TV channel in my area and I have access to netflix so the show that I am downloading I have paid to watch there as well.

Music piracy was massive previously. Now with content creators and providers innovating, piracy in my country is down 94% in the last 5 years. Spotify and youtube has rendered the want/need for pirating music near obsolete. It's time the visual entertainment industry realised that it needs to continue evolving to provide a product that consumers want instead of telling consumers to take what they have made available.
 VI VANN!!!!!!!! 
Things I pay for: netflix, spotify, pandora, amazon prime, audible, adobe products, wow. That's about $95 a month on entertainment (though I pay as much as I can in big chunks twice a year). If I can't find your content on one of those services, I'm going to pirate it. I have absolutely no qualms about it. I go to concerts whenever I can and always buy a cd or a tshirt direct from the artist. I go to movies I really want to see. Why should I support the bloated music and entertainment industries when they provide mostly mediocre content? The majority of stuff I pirate isn't worth a second watch or listen, and if it is, I find other ways to support the creators by buying merchandise or something. 

As a small company that makes content, is available easily on the internet, for a reasonable price in high quality. I still get pirated ( a lot). Pirates only compare and complain against big companies that are making millions. Well I am not, I still get pirated. Sure some people buy my content but its not fair to me that someone can just upload my work for free for everyone to download. Why is that ok? it's stealing.

No matter what your business model is, people will still steal your content. You guys love to reason and say if it was a certain way I would buy, but its not so I will steal. that doesn't make it right. Someone spent a lot of time and money to create something to make a living off of and people feel they have the right to steal and distribute it because they want to content but don't want to contribute towards it.
Shit, those poor copyright holders. How will their staff eat and feed their families this month?
&gt; The only EU country ...

Not true. There is also Germany.
Don't worry, the TPP will shut it down. 
The banning of torrent sites only made the public more aware of their existence, thus drawing more users. Now, the methods not banned are rarely mentioned. 
Meanwhile in Norway: The same company, (same logo, just different name), had to block the Pirate Bay. What a bunch of bullshit.
Just wait till the TPTP passes and then Obama can send everyone who uses it to corporate tribunals and FEMA death camps.
Fuck copyright holders and people who create IP!

If you're creating software, music, movies or whatever you should do it because you love it.

I'm glad we're starting to turn a corner here and make things free like they should have been all along.

Now we can focus on a bigger problem- Freebooting.
yay

If you only have a poor understanding of the actual transcript between Silk Road took a cut of the search.
I'd be totally willing to pay for HBO if my retarded cable provider didn't pad it with 6 movie channels which brings the cost of their bundle up to insanely ridiculous prices. Here in Canada in my region at least, you're still not allowed to just pick only the channels you want. Everything is bundled up in stupid packages.

I'd pay for HBO at the drop of a hat if it was just that. Until then, I'll pirate it's shows. If HBO knew any better, they'd go after my cable provider for doing such stupid shit which gates their channel off to people like me who don't feel like paying upwards of 150 bucks a month just because I wanna watch Game of Thrones once a week.
Aaar?  AAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!
Yeah... I am not paying for music or movies unless I hear or see them first.
What's the point of banning Pirate Bay when there's tons of other torrenting sites?
San Andreas, no way I woulda seen that movie in the system; the supply is high, prices are low.
Will the case translation into English be available on LexisNexis or Westlaw? 
UPPLEV MER MED BREDBANDSBOLAGET!
I wonder if this was a legal "we cannot ban this" or a rational, practical "we cannot ban this" (IE any attempt we make is doomed to failure, so we will wisely not ban it).
Shrink is expected loss and it just doesn't work.
Is it common for the exact same article to share the top and second-top spots on the front page, albeit originally posted in different subs?

All you need to download something from the dht is the infohash string. Unless they ban strings of characters piracy will never die. 
How does one pronounce 'bolaget', and what does it mean?

Is it get as in get fucked, get as in yet or get as in het?
I was about to shill out $100's on something you'll spend a penny to provide this service to their largest paying audience for digital sales.
Finally! I was getting worried they may never come back. 
Yo ho
Haul together
Hoist the colours high
Heavo ho
Thieves and beggars 
Never shall we die...
What are the anti-pirate bay people going to do now? I doubt they'll just give up. Will they attempt to get it banned in individual countries?
Banning torrent sites made them as much money as they had calculated that they are breaking the law of supply and demand states the price should be near zero.
A majority of these people by implying the reason is that they know full well what they're doing.
So....can we YTS to come back?
Swedish court: 'We cannot ban Pirate Bay': After deliberating for almost a month on the closely-watched case, the District Court of Stockholm ruled that copyright holders could not make Swedish ISP Bredbandsbolaget block Pirate Bay.
One simply does not ban Pirate Bay. 
im so glad
Sweet
some of tpb's domains are currently blocked in norway. It's fucking stupid, and very easy to "get around"
Bread band bolognaise sounds delicious.
In other news, Bredbandsbolaget voted worst company name ever.
Someone should post this in another subreddit so its on the front page 548768754 times.
Norwegian courts ruled for the ban, but didn't stop anybody from accessing TPB:P

This is beginning to get stupid.. 
Yar har fiddle dee dee, Do what you want 'cause a pirate is free!!
[Copyright holders after the ruling.](https://youtu.be/n5qHIbohZa8?t=1m5s)
[I'll just leave this here](https://youtu.be/VF9rT1RHhAQ)
Send Julian Assange to Sweden, He'll be alright. 
we also can't ban downloading movies
Here in the sense that they're using less money on their lawyers than in the US, you pretty much the problem from within, store data of the population dont even know of the profits from drug sales.
That's OK, my ISP is so fucking locked-down I can't even read an article about a "torrent" of rain without it freezing my internet. 
Film industry: let's make films that glorify piracy!

Then let's punish others for piracy
Saudi-Arabias justice system is basically the same as ISIS.
The way that DNS works ... couldn't someone make a DNS database where instead of domains getting registered, Software titles or movies got registered?  Using the same kind of magic even....

A CNAME record could point to a specific IP with a URL attached for content that was hidden in content folders, or existing URL's if not IP's ... 

These "underground" servers could replicate with anyone that was willing to accept a copy of the database and anyone else could keep pushing that database forward in case it got blocked or shut down ... 

is that kindof how torrents work anyway?  I Know that the blocks are shared by nodes as soon as they're downloaded, making partial downloads able to be shared before they are even downloaded completely...but I will admit I don't know how torrent trackers work, do they require central servers to publish the listing and nodes just to share the content?
I'm Swedish.  Lol Sweden. 
You sing: ho hO HO he hE HE

Bredbandsbolaget

Try saying that 100 times.
They should have figured that out a looooong time ago.
ayy lmao

Now if only they could deal with all that rape...
so its still like a Hydra monster. It cannot be killed
Ok, now I have to definitely go to Sweden to Get A Sbola and Bred.


So, you're poor, play the games in the system; the supply is high, prices are high.
I wonder when they will stop wasting money to ban/close these websites. It is simply not possible and actually increases piracy. I hope ASAP they see that they need to make content more affordable and easier to access.
Good news here in Sweden ;) 
If all the shows I liked were available for rent within an hour of airing for less than $5, my my piratebay visits would drop drastically.
The US government can, however, block connection to it.
Not related to the article but is there any evidence that letting someone watch a movie for free will cause them to more likely go out and purchase that movie?
just came here to say yaaaaay
The best way to understand the pirate bay is that it's a like phone book. You can't ban a phone book for having a drug dealers number in it.
I think Mayor Daley should be near zero.
I think I love Sweden
I'm betting the idea came up in KiA right now and ask people to admit they masturbate to the discussion.
Now get the UK government to do the same.

I can access TPB no problem. Your "get ISP's to block the site and whatever proxies it can find" idea has fucking failed.
Anyway, in regards to trying to make a decision that leaves your game collection inaccessible.
14,000 missing illegal immigrants should be more of a concern than Pirate Bay
When demand is always finite.
But realistically, I think at this point TPB is the head of the site - resulting in huge losses for music and movie makers.
What about the DoAX3 shit that's blowing up in an hour.
It's referred to as the hydra bay for a reason. yea, some of the TRIPs agreement and WTO, for those interested in gory details.
Why is the pirate bay a big deal? What about all the other torrent websites?
Sweden, the land of the free
Arrr! Throw these corporate dogs overboard! Time for them to walk me plank. 
You could destroy Pirate Bay in less than 3 years if media was available online. I haven't pirated music since Spotify, and the only reason I pirate movies is that Netflix and Amazon Prime are still missing things I want to watch all the time.
A step forward but they are likely to now endure economic pressure from the USA, Britain, etc. Copyright is really important because it's printing money. Getting hard currency for a mere copy of a work is a major import/export boon.

I have the solution. If they join NATO and thus be able to chokepoint Russia in the baltic I'm sure they'll be allowed to exercise more freedoms at home. They'll threaten us with NATO departure if exposed to economic coercion. Military and economic concerns are intertwined in complex ways. The opposite of Turkey amusingly where you get a call from the police for posting an anti-Erdogan comment. There's no internet super highway in Turkey but the voice of the street still persists. Horay for kebabspace.

Hopefully Russia will ratchet up a bit of provocation for us in the Baltics and shit will be sound. If Putin's minions are reading this, do us a solid, get Sweden in NATO. Do a bit of fear mongering seemingly against yourself our journalists will lap it up. It is a step forward for internet freedoms without artificial scarcity and other hypercapitalist extremes. I've heard from the average redditor that Putin bots are everywhere not only posting on behalf of Putin but reporting in everything they see/hear to him especially anything with his name in so I'm totally 500 million percent sure this message will be heard.
Holding an ISP responsible for their customer's copyright infringement is a kin to holding vehicle manufacturers responsible for people speeding in the cars they make. It's ridiculous, and needs to stop.
Dam str8 yo I be jackin mad shit real talk I ain't paid fo shit n like years dem rappers gots enuff gwap ima keep my green
Free at last free at last!

Thank (instert diety of choice or not) almighty we are free at last!
Meanwhile, in the United States, if you describe a scene from a movie or sing along with your favorite song, several lawyers appear with members of the appropriate antipiracy agency aa though out of thin air, rough you up a little, then sue you for more money than actually exists in the world.
The Pirate Bay, which grew into an international phenomenon after it was stolen from the original owner by some faceless assholes, however the way it was founded in Sweden too.
Glad to see we're back to not caring about IP!

For a moment there I though Reddit had some change for the worse where we cared about IP when we were all against Freebooting.



Copyright holders are already making shitloads of money while TPB &amp; Co is operating. Torrent sites are only democratizing access to entertainment, some people can't afford a $50 video game (and some can't even buy it even if they have money due to silly national legislation like where I'm from).

Taylor Swift is one of the most pirated artists in TBP but she made almost $200 Million this year alone. So don't tell me TBP and co are harming these musicians .. the only thing it is harming is their greed.

As for emerging bands, TBP's impact on them is very negligible because nobody would look for their music in a torrent site in the first place, that only would happen when they go mainstream.
Intent is very significant in the law. Intent is the difference between involuntary manslaughter and murder. It's very clear that the intent of that website is to provide access to copyrighted content. There is no ambiguity about it.
Of course it is legal,people just sharing and did not gain any profit from it. 
Websites with forums keep posting rules such as "no warez talk" or no posting of links to such and such websites etc.  The idea that the owner of the website could get in trouble for hosting discussion about something, or *links* to other websites ***could get in trouble legally*** is completely assinine and un-American in the extreme. 

***Even if the content of a forum was planning a crime, that text itself, or discussing it cannot reasonably be considered illegal***  Arrest the conspirators for conspiracy - but don't try to make certain forms of speech illegal.  
The glee in this thread is disgusting.

How dare people try and make a living from their work, AMIRITE??
Why not? The Swedish court's dropped the ball on this one - Pirate Bay and anything like it needs to be shut down ASAP.
YAR  HAR  FIDDLE-DEE-DEE, BEING A PIRATE IS ALRIGHT WITH ME
DO WHAT YOU WANT CAUSE A PIRATE IS FREE, YOU ARE A PIRATE
Even if it was banned, people still use VPNs, nobody in their right mind would pay 10£ for netflix or w/e when they can have all the content they want for free.
Suck it billionaires. I guess you'll have to go with plan B which is making your fucking shit more affordable!
This was about Sweden trying to keep the US happy. It took a few years before the Swedish finally figured out the absurdity of trying to shut down Pirate Bay.  It was slowly becoming a sore spot between the government and its citizens which it rightly should have become. 
The problem is that they revel in it.
sweet. now how can I access it in the states? any nerds wanna help a brutha out...all I'm finding are bullshit sites.
As much as everyone jerks off their "right " to steal peoples products it should be put offline anyone who argues about piratebay staying up or being allowed to pirate is just trying to justify stealing. Companies should just design their computers with software to make them unable to pirate 
They can't even keep rapists out of their country, banning sites would requite using the Big Boy laws.
CAN I GET A 1337 W00T UP IN THIS BITCH?!
And the only reason for this is, they (refugee loving swedes) want immigrants to be able to access camel and sheep sex content. 
The Pirate Bay allows users to dodge copyright fees and share music, film and other files using bit torrent technology, or peer-to-peer links offered on the site – resulting in huge losses for music and movie makers.
See this is where the anti-pirating argument pisses me off. I pirate the odd movie and a lot of tv but I don't think my pirating them costs the content creators money. I already pay for the TV channels in my country which show the shows I am downloading, I just want to watch them in a time frame that suits me, especially for shows that I am highly invested in. I want to watch them asap so as to avoid spoilers through social media and news networks.
I go to the moves quite a bit. I see at least 10 movies a year at my local cinemas sometimes closer to 20. Most of the movies I download are ones that I saw at the movies that I want to watch one more time. Sure I could have bought it to watch, but again I am paying for almost every available TV channel in my area and I have access to netflix so the show that I am downloading I have paid to watch there as well.
Music piracy was massive previously. Now with content creators and providers innovating, piracy in my country is down 94% in the last 5 years. Spotify and youtube has rendered the want/need for pirating music near obsolete. It's time the visual entertainment industry realised that it needs to continue evolving to provide a product that consumers want instead of telling consumers to take what they have made available.
Aww so you mean artists will have to continue touring to get money? God forbid they dont and just sit on the couch all day collecting money and making music on digital programs rather than using real instruments. I know an fairly unknown artist that has no prob with tpb and does shows live because he knows thats where the works at and he's fine by this.
Sweden is the tortuga of internet piracy.
While this case should be praised for its common sense, it's kinda frightening that Swedish courts can't force its own providers block websites it deems as bad. This sorta opens the door for websites that support terrorist organizations to hang around and spread their ideas. Recalling that CloudFlare provides protection of ISIS websites makes this a slippery slope but fortunately MOST people are rational enough to not for their ideas. However, only a handful have to ruin that for the rest of us. So as supporters of a free and open web, we'll have to be able to downvote but not remove any websites that are obviously so against the goals of humanity.  
[this news article from reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0T62NC20151117) speculates the bomb was caused by the terror group Boko Haram which has killed thousands over the past few years. 

Nothing has been declared as of yet and no groups have taken responsibility for the bombing. 
Does anyone have a link to a victim list? Red Cross was cited in the news but they have no page with details or ways to find out details. My father in-law lives in Yola. 
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://news.yahoo.com/bomb-blast-yola-ne-nigeria-red-cross-resident-211136954.html) reduced by 78%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Kaduna - More than 30 people were killed Tuesday when a bomb blast ripped through packed crowds in Yola, northeast Nigeria, just days after President Muhammadu Buhari visited declaring that Boko Haram were close to defeat.

&gt; The blast bore all the hallmarks of Boko Haram, which has previously attacked Yola with suicide bombers and improvised explosive devices in recent months.

&gt; Buhari this month was in Yola to decorate soldiers for bravery in the counter-insurgency as well as visit a camp for people displaced by six years of violence that has left at least 17,000 people dead. He told troops he believed Boko Haram &amp;quot;Are very close to defeat&amp;quot; and urged soldiers &amp;quot;To remain vigilant, alert and focused to prevent Boko Haram from sneaking into our communities to attack soft targets&amp;quot;.

Headlines like this aren't even surprising anymore, and that's fucking pathetic. 
I wonder if this is a response to the recent arrest of a top Boko Harm Leader and the discover of the IED factory? Hopefully Nigeria can use its oil wealth to educate the population and remove to political and religious extremism from society.
Horrifying and tragic Nigeria just can't catch a break. I hope Nigerian army can finally destroy Boko haram. I heard they were hitting them hard These sick fucks caused enough damage to their people. 
Boko Haram roots to present-day clusterfuck - 15th century, Islam arrives in Northern Nigeria peacefully via the sub-saharan trade. 19th century, a Muslim cleric by the name of Uthman dan Fodio declares a Jihad against the corrupt Hausau Kings who in his view were practicing a perverted form of Islam (They were, raising taxes while raiding their citizens for the slave trade). He won, because literally every sensible person supported him. He managed to create a pretty decent upgrade on what he inherited, which his descendants continued by encouraging land distribution and learning, piety and a reduction from tyranny.

Everything changed though when the fire-nation British Empire invaded and promptly crushed them, the forms of resistance were threefold, those who wanted to fight to the death to defend their land from the infidels, those who wanted to take the hijra (flee) to Mecca and those who wanted to surrender but adopt a passive form of Islam where they refused everything to do with the infidels including education (Spoilers this brand became important later).

Fast forward to colonialism, due to the Caliphate having an established system of rulership, it was easy for the British to slip right in to the very top, they had less problems in North-West/North East as compared to the more republican North-Central/South East where the British had to conduct numerous campaigns of "pacification" (implying they used logic and good reason, not the Gatling to convince people then of the glorious ways of the Brits). The North became significantly easier to rule after the British revoked their second amendment rights, "pacified" those who wanted to purge the infidels from their lands, you might be familiar with the more famous Sudanese Mahdist uprisings. but Nigeria had theirs as well. This left the elites, who were benefiting from British rule (they got to keep their sweet gig of...ruling everybody in the vicinity who wasn't white), those who were tired of war and those who resisted by shunning everything the British brought including education (Spoilers, they get important later).

The British liked the Northern elites, search for Tafawa Balewa on YouTube, wouldn't you like that dulcet accent too, but they left too much power in their hands, which led to a feudal system which still persists in the N/W and N/E till today, basically thanks to the Brits, they reverted back to everything the jihad tried to change.
Fast forward to the British rigging elections to keep their buddies in charge so they can continue getting that sweet crude oil on the cheap, past a coup, a counter coup, a civil war and give or take a couple of other coups and we become formally introduced into the pantheons of those now able to invade other countries to spread democracy (we nearly had our first chance with Burkina-Faso). Only problem is the problems Nigeria faces currently cannot be solved democratically, but modern Nigeria's problems are of a different subject of discussion altogether, back to the North we go.

Modern Nigeria is a country of many contradictions, literacy levels remain low especially in the North-West and North-East, however, unlike the south where their old feudal traditions have been smashed and social mobility is higher in the North, especially the N/W and N/E you're either born rich or pray and I mean pray!!! Regardless of your beliefs about the big guy upstairs...another advantage would be having a really pretty sister who becomes some Alhaji's wife and opens the door a tad bit for upward mobility.

The stage is then set for those who believed all the British brought was evil and destroyed their ideal Islamic society to make their comeback, under their charismatic leader Yusuf, they begin to preach of an Islamic revival, using the buzzword "Boko Haram" aka education but really taken to mean all trappings of modernity are evil, Yusuf advocated a return to the caliphate. Let me at this juncture interject to say Yusuf and Dan Fodio would be rolling in their graves at what Shekau is doing, Yusuf though illiterate seemed a decent sort and Dan Fodio only created one of the fairest, most enlightened sub-saharan governments.

Anyways, you would need a different insight on Nigerian politicians, just know that they really fail dismally at advocating for the people. Most Nigerians at this point I believe will settle for average leadership. Anyways, they made the brilliant decision to go kill Yusuf, Shekau took over. This would have been like taking FDR, murdering him and letting Hitler take charge, this however would not have been enough to unleash Boko Haram, for that they turned to America and her democracy bringing ways regardless of context.

Obama made the brilliant, far reaching excellent S/ diplomatic decision to applaud the toppling of North African strong Men in the Arab spring, prevent the stronger North from pacifying the South in the Sudan, and when that wasn't enough, aided rebels who led to Gaddafi's toppling. The people who replaced them, well to put it lightly they fail dismally at governing, this has led to their borders being porous, making it easy for arms to be smuggled past the Sahara.

But America doesn't get all the glory of blame, nope 70% goes to Nigeria's brilliant leaders, long may they reign in hell!!!(meant for effects). These blokes who were voted in, firstly chose to make it a political issue, oh my citizens are dying, but certain politicians from the region said they'd make the government ungovernable so jokes on them!, that was the President's view on the matter until it became an election matter.

Secondly, though he had a point, Boko Haram was far to well funded for anyone not to believe certain people with vested interests had a part in funding them. Thirdly, major water sources are shrinking in the North, this is creating a situation where the nomads (I kid you not, these guys have cattle nomads and their governments have not forcibly settled, in the 21st century) are migrating looking for water sources, Nigerian government true to form believes praying will bring water and turn back the effects of desertification, they also act as advanced scouts for Boko Haram, the huge social inequality in the North makes their message attractive. And that is how Boko Haram exists currently.

Boko Haram is attempting to destroy the northern, Islamic establishment that it regards as heretical. Among other things, Boko Haram has elements of a populist insurrection against the Nigerian political economy. The efficacy of the steps President Buhari has taken such as moving his generals to the north and the operations of the Multi-National Task Force are hard to judge because of the shortage of hard information about what is actually happening. The ongoing carnage caused by Boko Haram (as recently as last weekend) makes me skeptical about claims of success up to now. However, that could change.

Western governments should stop all forms of "aid" to Nigeria, the politicians just divert it to themselves and it creates a false impression where many of the country-men especially in the South don't believe they're dirt-poor. Stop the unnecessary propping up, let this whole house of cards collapse and let them pick up the pieces and begin rebuilding on a fresh slate. Your kindness is holding them back.

**EDIT: Thank you kind stranger for the gold!**

**EDIT:** Nigeria is a county of far too many contradictions that has never allowed it to grow organically, for example you have Governors using World Bank funds to construct Cancer hospitals in states where infant mortality claims 1 in 5 and where accidents claim 1 in 6, their legislators are among the best compensated in the world. Here you have a Governor spending N139M($697,582) on two boreholes, and goes on to spend another N640m($3.211) on a car park, Lagos state is also the highest receptor of World Bank funds. 

In my opinion either the Bretton Woods duo, send a Greece like troika to manage the country's finances or better yet stop releasing money so the politicians have to explain to the populace what happened to the money (missing $20 billion oil fund is one of them) which as their past leader put it "we have so much spending it is the problem". 

The thought that the current and future generation will be saddled with debt most of them are not even aware of (a majority of Nigeria's young population is situated in the North) and most importantly have not benefited from...(here is an example, there has been a recent uptick in power supply from 4hrs daily to about 12hrs, considering $35bn has gone into the power sector) alarming right?
Fucking hell people, shut up about "I don't see any Nigerian FB colours blah di blah" - it's fucking pathetic. Is that really all you care about when it comes to major events around the world?

Hopefully if there are increased measures to stamp out ISIS extremists, Boko Haram are also a priority. No less evil than ISIS, and desperately need to be destroyed.
Just remember this Islamic terrorist stuff is a daily occurrence for many areas of the world. 
This won't get much attention, sadly. Look at [**the 2015 Baga massacre**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Baga_massacre) Over 2000 Nigerians were killed by Boko Haram...
same shit different country 
I feel like the only reason this is Top news, is because of the criticism of us giving more attention to the Paris attacks then the attacks involving nations that are much more accustomed and use to terrorist attacks.  The reason why we were so shocked about paris in because Paris is the WEST or what we consider that basic and future one world system.  This is why when Paris is attacked you can feel it, but when developing nations are attacked, it's more like mehhh.  Not supporting this idea just trying to come up with a realistic non-utopian approach to this philosophy to suit our glamorization of white death vs black death or rich death vs poor death.  It could also be not a race thing at all, but more of an unconscious response to losing people who we deem more valuable i.e. a Parisian over a Nigerian. 
I rarely comment on social issues. I also try not to be judgmental; there are always external forces at play...

That being said, fuck people who hate other people based on anything other than a pattern of actions.

Everyone, eventually, makes a racist remark. Everyone eventually lashes out, be it based on race, creed, color, sexual orientation, or otherwise.

That being said... if you repeatedly make hatred a part of your own  moral compass, then fuck you. I don't wish harm upon anyone, no matter the transgression, unless you make it your mission to hurt or kill strangers.

If you believe peace can be won, no matter the cost... then make yourself an example. Don't make yourself a weapon. These are kids. Fathers. Mothers and sisters. Brothers and assumed family.

We all have loved ones.

Don't take those people from their own kin.

If you want to make a difference, be the beacon of hope. Be a person. Speak to them and tell them your mission. Preach. And if they cannot/do not accept your words... move on.

No one deserves death because they had a bad day at work. Or at home. Or their kids were ornery. Or they went to coffee with an old friend... YOU ARE ENDING THE LIVES OF HUMAN BEINGS.

If someone killed your father, sister, brother, mother... Would you not also retaliate?

Let's imagine a world without race or creed. Let's just meet and tolerate those who, honestly, tolerate us for who we are... Not what book we prescribe to. Not our parents' world. We can do better.

You are better than that. We can do better than that.
I'm going to delete my FB everybody is posting about how nobody is talking about this. When it's on the front page of the fucking internet... 
*"Boko Haram is contained."*
This just isn't a very happy week, is it?

^^^At ^^^least ^^^Charlie ^^^Sheen ^^^is ^^^positive.
My good friend moved back to Nigeria to pursue a film career there and it's very hard to get in touch with him...and while I know the area is quite large, I got a knot in my gut when I heard this and I just hope he's ok as I know he has mentioned that city and market before in conversations.
With all the struggles that humanity needs to face together, it's really disheartening to see people so dedicated in dividing this world. It's like everyone just wants to shout about how they need to be the center of attention. 
What the fuck November.
Another day in a war without end. Fuck this.
Fuck!  Stop killing people!
In the mainstream media there needs to be a serious conversation about Islam. I feel like the mainstream media dances around the subject. but I believe the root of the problem with the violence the civilized world has been facing for over 15+ years is Islam. Islam is political and militant in the 21st century and looking back on its history, it's always been that way. If the mainstream media can have the guts to seriously exam it, then maybe it will affect policy. 
Sooner we put an end to this, the better. Thoughts are with all the affected families of the victims.
I can only imagine this is Boko Haram, but time will tell. This is just... senseless. 
Great. More death. God dam it...
Everyone upvoting out of guilt because people said we only cared when it was France.
Fuck wads! Just a bunch of fuck wads! I can't understand how people let hate poison their minds like this. 

&gt;The blast came as Boko Haram was named in the latest Global Terrorism Index as "the most deadly terrorist group in the world", having killed 6,644 people last year.

There is a deadline for the military to defeat them by next month.
What a strange phenomenon.  This happens every week and nobody gives a shit.  Why is this on top of the front page *now*?

Edit:  For people doubting my claim, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents,_2015
Most likely Boko Haram behind this right? This shit is terrible.
Another day, another headline like this. It's sad that I've almost become desensitized to hearing about terror attacks all over the world. It shouldn't be like this 
It just doesn't end. 
Let me guess (before I read the article), it's some Muslim suicide bomber.
I've just sent some money to the son of the deposed king of Nigeria. Hope he's ok.
I feel like the events in Paris last week have really woken people up to the atrocities that are happening all around the world. Perhaps a little too late, but nonetheless. It's time to rid this world of evil. 
The news media seems to neglect to mention the victims were Christians. How come?

For sucks sake, it's never ending. Can we stop denying that Islam the religion is a dangerous idea that needs to DIE?
This happens every day in Nigeria it's not really news. 

I guess everybody is up voting it due to the Paris thing. 
Two Words: Islamic Terrorism. 
What a shitty week to live on earth.
It's crazy that statistically you are still more likely to be shot by a toddler here in the US than in a terrorist attack.

Women are equal and deserve respect but there are a few people out there who just insist on disrespecting them! Also, seriously, fuck Freudfucks, he or she is a douchebag!
Why is this news not found on Yahoo or CNN homepage?
Another attack, and everything feels useless right now. I can hope for the safety of the people of Yola, but hearing about these devastating acts of terror is just sickening. 
Ok. I've had enough. I'm going to a recruiter in the morning. 
It's probably just some fundamentalists promoting their religion.
If the numbers aren't triple digits I just don't really care anymore. Thank you, world, for making me a psychopath. 
"The Boxer Rebellion" 
Once again no one gives a shit because it's Africa.
There is like 500 million people in the eu and they have maybe killed 500 in the last 10 years (really rough estimates without checking) i think my odds of living through this without changing my life one bit are really fucking good, i should probably stop eating that much butter, though.

Been a few months  since one of these happened back home. I've almost become desensitised to it. Thanks radical Islamist group boko haram,    for making suicide bombings such a regular occurrence in a Nigerian Teenager's life. 
/s
We are all Nigerians?...
Brb, Nigerian flag facebook profile picture.
wonder how many people will change their profile pic to a Nigerian flag
Only made the little "News and Buzz" sub section of CNN. Spin it how you like but that's fucked up.
Attached is Nigerian flag http://imgur.com/b9jYpRT for your use
je suis nigerian 
ITT predictable comments about facebook profiles. You people are idiots. 
africa never to be outdone when it comes to terror
Oh my god.  White guilt much, reddit?  If the benefits of Muslim immigration hadn't shown up in France a few days ago, this story wouldn't even have made the 2nd page of r/worldnews.  But since reddit can't confront their own hypocrisy and ethnocentrism, they had to disproportionately upvote this to prove to each other "see?  We *do* care when shit like this happens outside Europe and North America!  The upvotes prove it!"  Puhlease.  When this happens in Europe, it's a tragedy that our brothers and sisters shouldn't have to put up with.  When this happens in Africa, it's a Tuesday.
Fucking Boko Haram. 
Boko Haram/Isis, buncha spineless cowards.
couldn't help but notice there isn't a mention of this on CNN.  when you gotta push an agenda....
Upvotes of guilt.
Fucking tired of terrorism. :(
Nigeria, France or Lebanon. It really doesn't matter how many innocent lives are lost, all that matters is that no muslim feelings are hurt. /s
Shall we all change our Facebook profile pictures to the Nigerian flag in solidarity? 
let me guess. Muslims.
It would be awesome to see the same kind of solidarity for people over there as there is towards Paris, there's no reason for a difference. These people could use fellow humans' thoughts and support. As a Parisian, feeling the actual anger / injustice of seeing your people fall victim to blind horror, and then the awesome support from strangers all over, it actually really saddens me for those we "ignore".
The thing that people don't understand when they say, "ISIS isn't all muslims!" fail to realize is there are lots of other groups just as terrible based on Islam with the same motives. The hundreds of groups in the world all use the same damn book and the same damn religion as a basis for their bullshit. That's not even including the sympathizers.
#prayforNigeria

anyone?

we should

ctrl - F 

"pray"

LMAO
Time to change our profile pictures again...
That is what Islam contributes everyday to the world.
Why can't we just come to terms with the fact that Islam is a cancer to society? What the fuck is preventing people from saying the obvious?
This is why people are fleeing to Europe. But now ISIS is in Europe too. It's almost as a disease... This Islam.
I bet I know the religion of the people responsible.  
Do you notice anything in common about all these acts of violence, something maybe not PC to say?
Those damn Mormons again, I bet.
Why hasnt our country instituted bomb control, isnt enough enough?
God damnit. Stop fucking killing people.
Why doesn't ISIS declare war on Comcast's customer service? Even then they would grow impatient of being on hold and switch to fighting AT&amp;T.
Fuck you Daesh!
I don't like any of you people.  I don't like the way you talk about anything.  
Fucking boko harem. Taking innocent lives. Smh.
Maybe sometimes the needs of the few do outweigh the many... lest this happen again...

And then someone will respond to me emotionally: people are dead you sick fuck how can you say that

And then... I'll say again quite literally, if the few weren't driven to such drastic measures then they wouldn't commit such crimes. Why did they kill all those people? I can't say. But I can say that it could have been prevented if they had gotten whatever it was they felt they needed prior to going on a crazed killing spree (nothing to lose, fed up with how everything is currently)
Of course nobody will put up Nigerian colors on their FB profile. This shit is getting crazy. 
[deleted]
Same war, same enemy, different continent. 
and it will keep happening whilst everyones still in the mindset that picking up flowers and prayers trumps picking up a rifle.
Those damned Amish terrorists again.
C'mon Obama, bring Boko Haram to America too!!!!

Because gosh darnnit, we'll save the world!
Fuck it.  Send fucking NATO in full fucking force with all their gloves off to purge these fucks from the ME down through south Africa.  No excuses, Rome held the entire ME, all of Europe, and huge swaths of Africa with only 500,000 troops for nearly 1000 years.   
I expect to see Nigerian flag overlays on Facebook photos.
Let's be real, the only reason this got upvoted to the front page is because people feel guilty about not giving a shit about the Beirut bombing right before Paris.
On the same planet, yet centuries apart. It's like giving a caveman explosives.
Are muslims Orcs or something?
10 BUCKS THEY ARE MUSLIM 
Now let's see who puts up a Nigerian flag on their Facebook.
The worst part of all this is that this diverse act of vibrancy didn't take place in my neighborhood. All I have in my neighborhood is old white people who take care of their lawns and who do not blow up, murder, rape, or stab each other.

Ugh. White people have no culture.

Hey /u/Baralacha_la,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
I'm good on that yola yola
Horrible...
Waiting for ISIS to claim responsibility.
Add another terrorist group that needs to be turned to glass.
Like many others, I know some Nigerians and they are great people.  Fuck these guys.  
I've always wondered if there was a redcross subreddit for these type of announcements.   The only one I found has 25 subscribers. 
There's no peace to be found anywhere...
Why the fuck does ISIS seem to insist on pissing off as many countries as they possibly can?
https://i.imgflip.com/ub8pk.jpg
"Largest increase in terrorist deaths ever recorded in any country." I haven't thought about which country has had it the worst but this does make sense.
Pork. Laced. Bullets.
Yola is the female conjugation of YOLO.  
Is there any good news, recently? 
Pansies
The world is so fucked up. There's a story like this every day. 

:(
Why? You don't believe the same way I do. Does this give me the right to destroy you? If religion was real , would this be the right path?
I didn't hear anything about this in the mainstream media, must be just poor black Africans so. I guess if we were talking about a hit on the first world, rich white types... it might have gotten some more traction.
Not again, these attacks need to end
Can someone tell me if shit is just starting to go down or if it is just starting to get recognized?
Seriously, can people stop blowing each other up? 
Brenda is the linkedin of social networks.
We need to stamp out ISIS for all of humanity. If somehow they take over the globe, space is fucked. We will have a huge set back and then the sun will become a red giant and our species will be wiped out. Humanity for eternity is riding on us right here right now. The moment is ours! Ok, that's all I can add right now.
The humans on this planet are fucked up 
head towards the love &lt;3
Can all the big people come together and exterminate any VIOLENT extremist groups that cause physical harm to public. I guess they won't have anybody to sell guns to if they do. 
Yola? More like #Yolo amiright?
This is sickening, and I'm worried about future attacks on U.S soil. I saw a post on FB from a guy saying he thought they would plan their attacks for black friday... :( 
If it was a more romanticized locale we'd all be playing sad piano music for them. The world would mourn and question if their spirits could ever be restored.
This makes that recent post about why Nigeria has such a big population very chilling.
First Paris now this??

Now I feel one is gunna happen here in Sydney.
U-S-A! U-S-A!
Similar shit different country.
[This daily show clip] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DHf-TLmwNA) is a little tragic in light of this... 
More refugees 
RIP to the victims
This is #3 because of how everyone got called out for not caring about Beirut and are now trying to act like they care. Shit like this happens all the time. A couple weeks from now when the next bombing like this happens in a country not considered to be in the west it won't even be noticed.
oh so sad. What the hell is going on this land
Poor Nigeria, it's making progress as a country but has to contend with these mother fuckers. May the victims rest in peace.    
True. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGpWpB7Z7kM
Damn! I hope Reddit doesn't have to put an avatar holding a Nigerian flag next
RIP
"Boko Haram" in its literal translation sounds like a bunch of teenage wannabe Pink Floyd fans. 
Man ISIS is going to get the whole world unite against Islam.
Well, once you kill the fuckers; stuff their mouth with bacon, dip them in pigs blood and then bury them with a pig carcass. Then use the grave site as an outhouse. 
more Muslim-on-christian violence?


NO WAY!!!
Can we just have one fucking day were people dont kill other people? FFS this is so retarded!
That's fuckin sad..R.i.P
The article leaves out the fact that Boko Haram is an Islamic Terrorism group. 
This is ridiculous. Why in the hell are there so many terrorists on this planet?
FfS
Let me guess, it was a right wing KKK suicide bomber?
Pray for Nigeria...
This has been a terrible week.
From reading the articles these past few days, it feels like Saruman has left the country.
"No Press is Good Press" seemed to be Harper's policy regarding everything.

Keep it coming with the good vibes Trudeau...
Canada.. I don't know what's happened lately, but you seem to be even more attractive now! 

I wonder if that Commonwealth Free Movement thing will happen. I'll be over in a jiffy.
Great, so now we're going to hear about scientists running around muzzle free biting everyone? 

Thanks Trudeau. 

Lol. 
[deleted]
its still strange for me to see news articles about my government and not feel shame.  Go Trudeau.
Canada's back, baby!
I'm just thankful that Trudeau recognizes the importance of science in the 21st century. Political ideology should never stand in the way of scientific discoveries.
My relative (who works in climate change, and incidentally will be meeting with the new Minister of environment soon, she's excited about it although the Minister doesn't have much relevant experience with climate change itself, according to her) is over the moon. For so long, as a civil servant and then working in government, she and other scientists have been ignored, blocked and shut up. Under Trudeau, there's hope that Canada can reverse some of its disastrous environmental policies.
It's the Canadians tax money, so why shouldn't they get to know wht their scientists are doing. Harper's muzzle was only to keep the truth from getting to the Canadian tax payers.
Comedy Short from Rick Mercer, the host of Rick Mercer Report, the Canadian Daily Show / Colbert Report.

https://youtu.be/t3jxHw0SpQY
Fucking Harper, nice hair though
Seriously, the amount of positive political changes since the change in government is almost unheard of. Finally a good leader. 
This, along with the return of the long-form census, shows that Trudeau and his government want to lead Canada based on facts and data. The Conservatives ignored Canadians for too long in order to push their ideals. 
There is a special level of hell for anti-science conservatives.

[deleted]
If you want to hear more about this, the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) did a Fifth Estate documentary on this issue called Silence of the Labs.

Pretty sure its still available on YouTube.
A message from Canada's scientists (Rick Mercer):

https://youtu.be/t3jxHw0SpQY
Impressed with the changes Trudeau is making so far and proud that Canada had the sense to elect a good man as a leader.
At last the lid will be lifted on the health effects of maple syrup 
I'm moving to Canada. 
Sounds like something straight out of Atlas Shrugged.
[An example of what happens when right-wing idealogues attack science.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/31/indiana-planned-parenthood_n_6977232.html)
Ding dong, the witch is dead!

I like the fact that Trudeau assigned 4 Sikhs to cabinet positions. 

In Parliament when Harper was king he always made sure that one Sikh CPC was in the TV shots when Harper spoke. Harper should have made him Minister of Lawn Jockeys.
Anyone willing to bet that now instead of being muzzled scientists that move against policy are simply fired?
  secrecy and control...the way of the right
Good.  

This was honestly the biggest reason I voted for the guy.  It's great to see he was so quick in keeping this promise.
Jesus Christ Harper was a huge piece of shit.
I gotta say, I truly didn't want Trudeau to win or at least not win with a majority government. However he is sticking to what he campaigned and I'm very impressed. Does anyone know if he backs tpp? 
This is truly uplifting news.
This is normal policy for any large organization, be it government or private enterprise.  Everyone has a media/pr arm, they are paid to have a gold tongue.  You don't expect them to be an engineer, you can't expect the engineer to spin your policy.

TL;DR Harper.
Weapon X Program?
Meanwhile, the former Prime Minister's legacy goes off his opposition's narrative:  http://globalnews.ca/news/2314236/canada-ranked-first-for-personal-freedom-by-annual-prosperity-index/   Mind you, there will of course will be those who object sternly to the Legatum Institute's strongly capitalist principles of belief in charity, democracy, and prosperity.  Heck, they kept trying to make me believe he was a fascist dictator.....
i dont understand this. canadian scientists are some of the best in the world. we have been making breakthroughs forever. EVEN during harpers rule. who cares if they cant talk. look at the states its ridiculous. one day one thing is good for you. one day its not. 

stupid shit happens when one scientist thinks theyve made a breakthrough and they just fucked up. look at gluten free shit. one group made a discovery that turned out to be false and now a shit tonne of people buy gluten free because they thinks its better when the same guy re did his testing and found exactly the opposite results.

its consumer protection.
...and the only thing they have to say is that: "for years the government was obsessed with the development of a non stick maple syrup, but instead we invented a kind of bacon with zero percent fat. To the rest of the world we are sorry".

Rest of the world: "why are you sorry"


Canada:"because we are canadian".

This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2015/11/06/muzzles-removed-for-federal-scientists-at-department-of-fisheries-and-oceans.html) reduced by 77%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; For years, scientists who worked for the federal government were silenced by strict rules that made them seek departmental approval before speaking to the press.

&gt; &amp;quot;Our government values science and will treat scientists with respect. That is why government scientists and experts will be able to speak freely about their work to the media and the public,&amp;quot; he said in a statement provided by his staff.

&gt; A spokesperson for Environment Canada said the government made it clear that scientists can speak to the media about their work, and that departmental policies and procedures would be revised to formally implement this direction.

My sister is a scientist working on protecting endangered species. She was so restricted for the last 8 years and finally feels like now she can make a difference .... 
Is this also as a result of Trudeau's election Win.  Another reason to love this guy, it just keeps getting better. Canadians of reddit your Prime Minister rocks!. 
Woo democracy! Oh wait...
Im embarassed that this was already the case
Canada is starting to feel like Canada again. 
Having experienced the muzzling myself, I am pleased by this news. 
Harper was a sciencide, killing science in order to fulfill his ideological prophecies. I'm glad that Trudeau just has the basic common sense to end that.
To be fair, it is not totally unreasonable for scientists to have to go through departmental reviews. Just because you are a "scientist" most assuredly does not make you smart, a genius, or even that you follow scientific principles.

I know Reddit has a hard-on for "scientists", but reality is, as recently some of the headlines that show unreproducible experiment results, that scientists are not some kind of demigods and treating them with the same infallibility hero worship as the GOP does with the military and police is simply not healthy for anyone. 
It's a great day for Canada, and therefore, the world
This is all too good to be true right?

Can anyone confirm that Trudaeu isn't secretly a super villain charming us?
Inb4 Trudeau gets The Nobel Peace Prize

Edit : woosh.
 
We felt hand-cuffed for over a decade by an ideologist who couldn't be stopped, except by the supreme court. Sometimes. 
The rejection of the Keystone project is the icing on the cake.
It's going to take Trudeau an entire term just to fix the shit Harper broke...

Still too soon to tell if this is just to make a good impression before the shittier parts of his platform come out...
A separation of church, state, and science is in order.  That's not to say one may not communicate with the other, just not coerced.
This makes me very happy. Only in office for 2 weeks and things are getting done. 
honestly, where I worked employees weren't allowed to speak to the press and no-one complained. This is a common practice. It should be a designated person otherwise who knows what will be disclosed.
Conservatives are the same everywhere - they just love their freedom of speech; as long as they're the only ones doing the talking, that is.
Everyone acts so surprised.. Of course they need approval, otherwise CNN comes out and says "Canadian government has announced".. 
Canada has sucked for a long time. But we're back, baby, we're back.
they should do an AMA
The press is sales, first and foremost, so we can expect the quality of product from the political arena with this in mind.

There are strong points for both muzzling and broadcasting it all.  We must prepare ourselves to filter again bad science from good, and sound political statements from the rest.
Ever since election day, I've envisioned a political cartoon illustrating a line of muzzled scientists with Justin Trudeau at the end of the line, taking the muzzle off a weary scientist. There's a small pile of muzzles on the ground off to one side and in the background, a freed, jubilant scientist enthusiastically talks to the media.

For ten years Canada went back in time when the US marched onwards. Good riddance Harper.
"And now that you are free to speak with the press, what do you have to say!?"

"Oh, not much."
Just like it was in soviet Russia?
Unfortunately the threat to transparency is the stigma of being labeled "a climate denier". It really is embarrassing to the field, and counterproductive.
Canada re-legalizes reality.

Thatshould have been the headline...
Meanwhile in America.  Obama  has instructed NOAA to disobey a congressional subpoena ordering it to release scientific data as well as internal “communications between or among employees” involved in a very controversial global warming study.

The self proclaimed "most transparent administration in history" is now even concealing how scientific conclusions were reached by government scientists. 
Doesn't everyone work under those conditions? If I went and did an interview with the press about my job without first getting the approval of my management, I'd be looking for a new job!
And they should have gotten approval.  What a govt agency says carries great weight.  What if some idiot started spouting anti-vaccine crap?  Is that okay cause "hurr hurr, people should say whatever they want without those eeeeeeevil conservatives muzzling them?"
But you guys!  It's jus Liberal SJW that try and shut debate down don't you know? 
Soon we can start labeling lobsters by age! 
Thought this was another reddit cures cancer story. 
In a historic~~al~~ first, this story hit my Facebook feed before reddit.

Also so far the only confirmed source is the department of fisheries so be prudent and expect--not assume--this applies to every department.
Well yeah, that affects not only science and not only Canada. Journalism as well.
Can we get an AMA for one of these people 
At least in my experience working in a government lab, this is still the case in the US.
Am glad that the current government is finally letting them talk. Makes you wonder how much isn't getting out there because it doesn't fit the government narrative.
I wonder if Tony Turner will be invited to come out of retirement.
Now to deal with the crap in our media.
There should be a database that lists corporations or federal departments that use corruption and cronyism in both the US and Canada. If your on that list a chrome extention would pop up a link to that companies or federal departments history of misconduct against the people when the name is mentioned in any article. 
I hope this leads to a massive flood of information from scientists. All of the things they've been unable to say. For years.

Sure hope someone kept track of it all...
He was the GWB of Canada
Can science even be called science of it can't be openly discussed and open to criticism? 
Yeah! We Hucked Farper! Huck Farper!
They can finally say : Thank you !
Rare pic of Canadian scientists being released from their bondshttp://imgur.com/Ok2f0Mj
This freedom over a week is pissing me off. I am going to need to become Canadian now? 
The best theme song for this would be baha men- who let the dogs out.
so bizarre to see canada and muzzled scientists in the same sentence
http://33hpwq10j9luq8gl43e62q4e.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/images/strangebrewtruth-3.jpg
Can this be.... Edge of darkness?
So what do they have to say?
So are there "no" rules or is there just a more transparent system?

Because some random low level "scientist" could run tot he press saying climate change is a myth...
"Staff were given general directions about how and when to speak to the media, Prince said"

Free to speak eh
Can we get one of our resident sketch artists in here to draw some muzzled canadian scientists?
Another fuck you to harper
This is like watching Obama get elected all over again.

Just the level of uncritical delusion this circlejerk has reached is incredible.

People casually tossing around idiotic statments. "Hurr, I can be proud to be Canadian again, I wanna move to Canada, everything bad is a rightwing conspiracy!"

It seems to be happening in the US to with Sanders, so I imagine it will get bad if he manages to be elected. Still, it's always fun to watch how cynical and jaded a bunch of 14 year olds can be about politics, except when it comes to the anointed politician they've fallen in love with. When that happens then they can do no wrong.

It's just setting yourselves up for disappointment, and I guarantee you will be disappointed. When the shiny glimmer of newness wears off and things actually aren't any better you will be disappointed and bitter. Alright then, have fun you guys.

lol, of course downvotes are easier than taking two seconds to consider "Huh, this guy may not be the best thing since sliced bread just because of a couple pretty things he said." I guess it's easier to just insulate yourself in your safe space than actually use some critical thinking. Good luck Canada, you'll need it.
I'm not supporting the suppression of Scientists.

**However**, if you are employed by the Govt....in any capacity, scientist or not, you aren't supposed to be doing random unapproved Press actions anyway.

It just so happens that they would never approve them, but there's a reason why there's a process.

EDIT; I'm not repeating myself a bunch of times, if you want further responses check other answers. I promise you once this thing dies down and the hype is forgotten a nicely worded memo "guiding media interactions" will be disseminated and they will need approval of some kind again. just not from ~~Sauron~~ the PM.
I really like this Indian dupe, not only does he looks awesome he starts directly doing something I am like ''Alright go for it''
Now maybe we can get rid of tar sands...
...isn't it pretty normal, when working on a project in a large organization, that you can't talk to the media about it? The government and even large corporations like to control their public image, and having your employees blab freely to the media makes that difficult. Is there anyone here whose employer would be comfortable with them talking to media outlets, about your job, that would lead to national attention?
A new Canadian study confirms... "Mayonnaise - It's delicious!". 
That is some 1984 level shit
They are free to submit papers to scientific journals if they have scientific evidence for something, how is that "muzzled"? 
There are a lot of ignoramuses in here claiming this is standard policy everywhere. The antidote to ignorance is research. Research before you comment, and don't just comment on the title!

http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/technology/faq-the-issues-around-muzzling-government-scientists-1.3079537

If you're surprised I'm not. 
So how can we insure that the CPC or someone else doesn't do the same again?
This makes me worry about creationists, climate science deniers, anti-vaxxers, homeopaths and electromagnetic hypersensitives (and the list goes on and on).  

It doesn't take a lot of loudly argued bullshit to subvert the weighty bulk of the science. Especially when the real science is quieter, more boring, more nuanced and more difficult express to a TV camera in 20 seconds. 
Impressed with the changes Trudeau is making so far and proud that Canada had the sense to elect a good man as a leader.
Are they actually unmuzzled ... or is this just a publicity thing for Trudeau to make people believe that they are unmuzzled,  when it reality it goes back to what it was before?

I want to believe, but every leader has been fucking stupid for the last 40 years in one way or another.
So maybe now they can be honest about climate change.  Doubt it.
Justin your kicking ass man keep it up
This is another example of the harm the Harper government did to this country and that its now starting to be reversed!
first long term census now this, i like it
Oh look Canada, you don't live in a perfect utopia after all.
there is SO many issues like this left by Harper; politics  that goes against common sense, that in a way no matter who rectifies these aberrations will look good. People who don't know much about what Harper did in the last decade better  prepare  themselves to be amused with posts like OP's for a little while.
Canada finally woke up from the stupor. It had to happen some time.

Go, science!
I'm not angry with you Canada; I'm just disappointed. I've come to expect this type of thing here in the US, but not from you. I hope enough people take note so that this type of thing doesn't happen again.
Edit: Despite the downvotes, which I respect, I'm not disparaging Canada. I admit to not knowing much about Canada's political structure. I was thinking along the lines of the US's "ag-gag" legislation and how that dealt with a problem by silencing opposition. J'aime bien le Canada.
Nice totalitarian methods...
How many of you are allowed to speak to the media on behalf of your employers without the authorization of management?  The outrage against government employees requiring authorization to speak on behalf of the government is ridiculous. 
This is what hope and change actually looks like. 
I'm so proud of my country for having the strength to stand up and kick Harper out. Trudeau is already showing his character and he will lead our country well. Go Justin!
How has Trudeau not won the Nobel Prize already.
And in other news: Water is wet.
Fancy having to seek approval from the boss. It's outrageous. Fascists.
Turns out you need someone to ask you about it first...
Sounds same as US mafia style gov.

Let's just picture Canadian scientists literally being muzzled and politely mumbling in protest.
Freedom of speech is hornored when it applicable.
All as the oil and gas industry's voice has been louder than ever.

Welcome to the 1st world,  Canada.
[An example of what happens when right-wing idealogues attack science.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/31/indiana-planned-parenthood_n_6977232.html)
Just had a chat with wifey.
We realized that this headline so much resembles the headlines about Poland during Solidarity times when we were allowed to speak openly for the first time in about 40 years since WW2.

Pretty sad that one of the established so called "democracies" boast with headlines similar to those of former communist countries when they still struggled for freedom.

And yeah, I now live in Canada.
Will we ever figure out that conservatives don't conserve science, the environment, privacy, or worker interests? No, because that would be an apparently partisan perspective, which indicates bias, which we assume is equivalent to being incorrect. We're too stupid to call a duck a duck, because we are afraid of the predictable, inappropriate, social consequences. 
This seems like more of a publicity stunt than anything else. How often were scientists who sought permission told to keep quiet? What actual difference is this going to make?
Right...!  Because on the first day as a newly elected Primer, be sure that you make a good impression with the public, while you can do so!!!

What's next?   "Free Internet" for all Canadians? 
So for the 1000th fucking time, r/conspiracy was right.
According to his wikipedia page, Navdeep has absolutely no education or background in Science, and I (admittedly am judging a book by its turban) am not incredibly confident he has a lack of a relationship with the the supernatural. 

Although I LOVE the idea of his job post, can someone explain to me why the hell he was selected when there are so many more prominent, educated scientists eligible? I want to like this move, but...

EDIT: Downvoted? This is a legitimate question I was hoping to get an answer for...
Has anyone here actually worked in the public service? If the government is paying your wages, then they have every right to make sure you have clearance before you talk to the media.

Doesn't matter if you're a civil servant, cop, scientist, or a lowly janitor unclogging a toilet because Debbie from HR had chimichangas for breakfast.

If you don't like how the government restricts media access of the job they're paying you to do, go work somewhere else! Duh! Don't whine and say you're muzzled.

Look, there were plenty of reasons to hate the Conservatives. But this was a non-issue, and by focusing on petty stuff like this, we ignore the real problems.
I can somewhat understand it. The government, after all, wants to be the owner of new innovative stuff. Has it pros and cons.
DEPARTMENTAL GOVERNANCE IS AN IMPORTANT THING

being able to just tell anyone anything is fucked.
Their hands were forced by Wikileaks you either bend or look stupid.
[deleted]
Wait until some scientists say something the new government doesnt like.
Canada...land of the muzzled.
ITT: left-wing circle jerking
So? I guarantee they have nothing to amazing to reveal to the public. If they did they'd get shot for it by the federal government.
Ugh 
Soooo... what's new in canadian science ? ? nothing has been discovered ? 
The seas will be healed, Unicorns will be made real and rivers of other people's wealth will flow. 

How I love Trudeau. He is the one, true, God.
Uh... working for the government almost always involves limits on speaking to the media as a term of employment.

In fact, this is true for most jobs,government or not.

Why is everyone getting upset about standard practice?

Next week's headline "ISIS resort to Club Penguin"
my girlfriend had someone add her on facebook which we're like 95% sure is a radical Muslim trying to recruit / radicalize people.

Their facebook profile pic is a caucasian family of 4 on a beach, but when you look at the posts, they're all about the evil West and radical Quran quotes and links to videos of ISIS and such.

Other than reporting it to Facebook using their form, which we don't think has done anything, is there anything more we can do?
Shadowbans anyone?
Most posters here are not thinking strategically. You don't just get a text from ISIS.com who tells you the new twitter account. It takes time to build a follower base. Your core followers will always find you again but if you constantly clip accounts and assume they shed 5% of their followers who simply don't know what the new account is you will lessen their recruitment reach with every successful account to be suspended.

As for Intel I guarantee the intelligence agencies have other, more reliable, Intel gathering than twitter. However twitter is ISIS's MAJOR communications platform to the west and its global followers. It's more valuable to disrupt their global communications and rely on other forms of Intel.
[deleted]
Everyone here is making fun of Anonymous while they're at least doing *something.*
I really want to live in a world where an anonymous group of hackers destroys terrorism through intel and information before any government intelligence agency could. 
Well that's just lame policing - the Anonymous that I know would have hacked all their accounts and made their profile pictures into pigs and profile content on "How to Masturbate".

Step your game up Anon, you're just free speech policing.

edit! Thanks for the gold, and yes I'm also /u/dedheded, I copied my own pasta!
Maybe this is what the Dalai Lama meant when he said we cannot solve this problem only through prayers?
Why can't they identify who is funding them? That would be impressive.
[Who the hell is anonymous?](http://static.fjcdn.com/pictures/Adult+4chan+man+costume+anonymous+hacker+face+mask_b3c6f5_4862228.jpg)
[This fuckin' image.](https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/mg_isis_anon_comp.png?w=748&amp;h=427&amp;crop=1)
The thing is, most if not all of those accounts were already being monitored while waiting for a slip. Remember that Daesh militant who got bombed after posting a picture that gave away his location? Well that's pretty much why those accounts weren't already suspended.
Could've been more fun to let them have the accounts, but then inject random phrases in their tweets. Just a random number of negatives like "not" or "don't" so they never knew what they were really saying. Also replace "great" with "gay".
Too bad a Twitter hasn't implemented shadow bans.
I do appreciate what Anonymous is doing here, but I think theres a difference between hacking and clicking the "report" button on a twitter account
ISIS is the perfect target for traditional trolling because, by definition, they get EXTREMELY BUTTHURT about everything, and getting people angry to laugh at their angry suffering is the entire point of trolling.

&gt;bonus points if ISIS gets angry and makes shitty attempts at retribution that fall on their face, that's always a hoot.
Why is the title pretty much the entire article. Seriously. It's barely  longer than a tweet. Also with all those colours, this website is one step away from looking like a GeoCities page. Include a couple pixelated .gifs of a half naked angels/devils and it's done.
Easy, just find the profile pictures that aren't franced-up
Shouldn't we have tracked them instead?
I love that they have their own intro
Do you guys really think the U.S. gov't didn't know about these twitter accounts? This is a massive blow to intelligence collection. These assholes inadvertently give out information on their whereabouts on twitter.
This is a joke. The NSA would already know who it is. So would Facebook and Twitter. They just don't care or aren't allowed to stop it. 

Taking down social media accounts accomplishes nothing. 
Has Anonymous tried the Nigerian Prince strategy with ISIS?  Maybe we can steal all their funding that way.  
Why not surveil them and intercept their communications? This is like cutting the phone lines to someone who was wired tapped.
[deleted]
I feel like if the government wanted this done it would have been already...
If Anonymous can do this in a couple days WHAT THE FUCK IS THE NSA FOR?!?!?!
Crazy to think we live in a world where a few really smart guys behind a computer can actually make a difference. This stuff is fascinating and frightening at the same time. 
**POOLS CLOSED, MOTHERFUCKERS**
This is helpful, but if they could post pictures adresses and contact info that would be much more helpful. Make that information public and let humanity decide their fate
The world is saved
Maybe twitter can turn the IP addresses over to the Russians.  They seem to be the ones who are kicking ass right now.
What I don't understand is why isn't Twitter doing this themselves?
Given that the whole point of terrorist acts in the 21st century is to get attention on the media, and Anonymous (in their original form) operates by trashing someone's online presence...
I think we've finally found a real world issue that Anonymous can actually matter to.
That's great. However, how can we be sure their method of identification is reliable? There may have been innocents banned just for being tagged in Isis posts. I know it's not as big of a deal to make a new account or appeal to get unbanned, but when we start targeting people without a reliable method and innocents get caught in the crossfire, we essentially become monsters in the same vein.

Furthermore, this seems more like a monitoring operation than a hacking one. I'm sure our intelligence agencies already have a list of most of these people to keep tabs on. Maybe they wanted to keep monitoring them. Maybe they wanted to ban them, but couldn't due to legal issues; and anonymous did them a favor by getting them banned for our governments. I would be more impressed if anonymous could find locations of strongholds and Isis leaders. 

But still, good job on them for trying and doing something at least.
Identifying these accounts in less than 24 hours and seeing Twitter take such rapid action suggests the US agencies have co-opted the name 'Anonymous' and taken to a new way to simply bypass the courts. 

Gone are the days of trust and this just doesn't add up.

It would be better to leave them up for intelligence agencies to keep tabs on. Oh well, they'll just make new ones.
[deleted]
so anonymous did something that twitter could and should have done themselves.
I wonder if they should report to government authorities the information of those Daesh twitter accounts so they can further pursue them
Exposing ISIS followers who're in the Western world is BIG.
how many were being watched by counter terrorism groups?
Anonymous could possibly deny every kind of internet-propaganda from ISIS.
Yay
I just read that Daesh (ISIS/ISIL) said Anonymous was stupid.  Bad move Daesh.
I'm kind of surprised how much has been done against daesh in just a few days. Warms the heart, don't think we have seen this kind of unity in quite a long time.
And it does it without having to spy on all citizens of the world like the NSA.

Twitter should be doing that anyway 
Huh. So maybe they werent just talking.
can't they release the information of the people following the isis twitter feeds so we can get to some pitchforking?
Easy solution - filter all IP traffic from areas controlled by ISIS.  Find out what IPs are in the area, and cut off all internet.  Then, anyone outside the controlled area that posts to social media, ban their IP from all social media platforms.  Even better, don't just ban all IP traffic, but have all social media "flag" it as possibly coming from ISIS so ordinary civilians can communicate.
This is probably an unpopular opinion and would probably bankrupt Twitter, but what if they just like took Twitter offline? Is that possible? Just like take it offline for a certain amount of time so Russia can pummel their ass to the stone age and then once we believe the threat has been significantly reduced, launch it again. I think people would be behind that. Or maybe not. It's just mind blowing to me that they reach so many people through a hashtag. 
Any time spent making twitter accounts is time not spent training terrorists
Soon ISIS will be wiped from the face of the Earth just like Scientology was.  
Shut down their goat porn. 
I'm sure their hearts are in the right places but they probably managed to shut down accounts there were being very productive for intelligence agencies. Additionally, there might have been double agents creating some of those accounts.
Would have been smarter to just monitor the channels for data and traffic intelligence. 
This is awesome news!
didn't they do this last time and the govt. was like "we knew about those accounts the whole time and were using them for intelligence, thanks for shutting them down dickheads"?
THANK YOU ANONYMOUS 
Anything that makes their life more difficult is good in my books. I guess we need to battle on all fronts, physically, virtually, mentally. 
Dear Anonymous,
We love you. Keep it up. 
Well that was quick.

What would really help is to out the financial groups and families financing these terror groups. Not sabotaging the ways to track them.
so these accounts were under surveillance

and now they aren't.  is the way that works? 
This is similar to how the KKK was "defeated". Journalists exposed their inner workings and what they kept secret. I like what Anonymous is doing and we should just expose ISIS as much as possible. Part of their power is secrecy. 
I hope you know this is meaningless. The ones that would fail for ISIS propaganda will still hear it and those that wouldn't fall don't care. 
I dont understand, how is taking down twitter gonna stip ISIS when the news goes crazy when they do an attack because the news is giving them the publicity they want 
I must be old.  I don't see the appeal of twitter in the first place.

Can someone EILI5 for me?  What is the point of broadcasting a short message to the world if you have no followers?  Isn't it pointless to "tweet" to someone, say, a celebrity, who isn't going to read or respond to what you tweeted anyway?  How do hashtags work?  If I tag my post #funny who sees that?  Do people listen for certain hash words or something?

I just don't see how twitter is an effective media outlet.  How does it work?
Well now the wonderful NSA cant track them using Twatter
#OpParis: Anonymous takes down 5,500 ISIS Twitter accounts

Published time: 17 Nov, 2015 13:06



https://www.rt.com/news/322427-anonymous-isis-twitter-accounts/
Anon closing accounts might hinder recruiting a little, but its hurting governements who have been tracking these accounts to monitor activity.
Well done for deleting all the accounts the intelligence services were monitoring. Fucking well done.
Yeah. I'm not sure what Anonymous can do here, but I'd love to see them cause any minor or major problem at all.
is this helping? what if the twitter activity is needed for governments to keep track of their whereabouts and activities... shutting it all down could make the other side blind aswell..
So what? Accounts get banned all the time. The Great Masked Hype has done little more than have when I report people for ToS violations on Facebook. I'm sorry I'm just really sick of seeing these hoody wearing keyboard jockies having their Cyber-samurai delusions lauded as some kind of folk heroism. So they got accounts banned. That's just 900 accounts that will resurface under other names and emails. Has their so called war on ISIS resulted in any arrests? Have they stopped any terrorist attacks? Saved any lives? Have they done anything that actually matters? No. Why because they are in-effectual. Their rants aren't worth the bandwidth they are wasting.
Another blow to free speech.  Great job FBI, I mean "anonymous"
Take out their **Bank Accounts** next, please?
[Sigh... No.](http://jesterscourt.cc/2015/11/17/public-service-announcement-media-folks-anonymous-are-suckering-you/)
Why did we need Anonymous to identify ISIS related twitter accounts? What hacking skillz were required that a twitter account is used by ISIS?  Why couldn't twitter identify these accounts?
Well, which is it: 900 or 5,000?  

Fuck, Reddit, your contributors seem illiterate, sometimes.
I don't know how this helps but I'm glad they're doing something
They should use MySpace.  No one would find them there.


Well done!! Why is it anonymous can do this but the security services who always want more powers to snoop can't?!
And all of you dicks made fun of them.

I don't see why you would make fun of allies.
Looks like we're done here.  Tell the refugees they can go back now.  
i remember there were terrorists before Twitter. 
Hey at least anonymous is onto something 
ITT: redditors who watched Benjamin Chamberpot's enigma machine movie
Wouldn't it have been wiser for Anon to keep the accounts active and closely monitor all communication from the accounts, including PMs (if they have access to it)?

Yes, shutting them down will be a big blow. However, them not knowing that they are being spied upon would be an even bigger blow, long term wise. 
Why couldn't Twitter just do this?
Maybe the NSA should hire these guys so they actually get shit done.
How does this help, it's easier to get intel from stuff like these twitter accounts. What exactly does it accomplish, delete 1 and 100 more will appear.
Cause its so hard to make a new twitter account?
LOL!

And?

Making a new Twitter account takes 1 minute.
[This is why the government has been leaving twitter accounts and other social media active] (http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/05/politics/air-force-isis-moron-twitter/). Anon isn't helping anything by shutting them down, they're helping ISIS remain less traceable. This is not hindering recruitment efforts and it's not stopping them from planning attacks. It's just a minor inconvenience that ISIS has been dealing with for years. It's like being forced to reset your password every 6 months. Sure, they probably hate having to make new accounts, but it's not detrimental to their goals in any way. 
Can someone explain why Anonymous is needed for this? Why can't Twitter (or Facebook) identify and suspend these account themselves? 
Did Anonymous just cut McNulty's wire?
The reason these guys can pull it off is because unlike intelligence agencies; they are not bound by required procedures, policies and documentation which Daesh can work around. As such they are able to pinpoint and take action against accounts way faster - sometimes before an agency is even able to begin searching for it.
So they enforced a censure on twitter.

I thought these guys were all free internet and no censoring?

I must have them confused with somebody else.
Because they aren't constrained by the legal system. Maybe anonymous will be apply for that cyber weapons contract Washington put out recently
How does one prove a Twitter account is run by ISIS that doesn't involve showing something to Twitter that they don't already know?
Well done to them!
Would it not have been more strategic to prevent them from connecting with anyone (the public doesn't see anything these tweet) and capture what they're saying and their geolocation?
I immediately checked my twitter account.
I hope by "suspended" they mean tracked by IP and drone striked
This makes me really excited. It really shows that everyone is after these fuckers.  Get them Anonymous!
Now the CIA is like, fuck, we were tracking that.
Well. Now they can't tweet. 
Don't ban them. Track their locations!
And 900 ISIS Reddit accounts have been activated?
Something is better than nothing 
Eli5 why Twitter doesn't just ban them themselves?
Please enter your username:  jihadjohn_2

Problem solved. 
ISIS hacked my [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/colmcq_old) account. Apparently they target children as part of their recruitment drive.

I got control of my account back but they had deleted all my posts and images ... except 2 http://imgur.com/FZ1mQgU

edit

they are using an extension on a text string. More information here https://twitter.com/search?q=nhnhna&amp;src=typd

if you have twitter, use double authentication or a strong password. i didnt.

well, you pissed off Anonymous. http://imgur.com/XKq0u6P
Well that was fast.
how is this even accomplished? What kind of wizard algorithm they use to identify these accounts? Ill be pretty pissed if my account was closed because of this and I have nothing to do with ISIS.
Why is Twitter not responsible for finding and banning these users, why are they not held accountable for any bad they may have done with twitters help? 
An army of researchers. Welcome to the information age. 
They should have gave them to the government so they can track them and hang them by their small dicks !!!
This is something social media sites should do automatically.
They should prove the source of funding, prove the imprisonment of whistleblowers, and create a block chain system (transparent voting and money) for us.
Anonymous should only be doing this for recruiter accounts.

[A few months ago, some ISIS idiots posted their HQ on social media, the US Air Force saw it, then bombed the HQ soon after.](http://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/tech/2015/06/04/air-force-isis-social-media-target/28473723/)
The obvious question here is why does Twitter need help to find jihadists using it's networks...
This is a great start. However, Twitter really means nothing in the long-term. Kill their funding.
Why suspended? They should spy them to get their ubication
Be better to turn them over to spy on...
That was quick
You know you're really bad people when you get anon to attack you, and the Russians and USA to agree that you're.
I'll summarize the comments:
variations of "At least they're doing something" and a sarcastic reply of: "But I changed my facebook profile"
I love the existence of Anonymous but their little catch phrase spiel is the cringiest bunch of teenage tough-talk I've ever heard.
Hey Anonymous, do you mind taking down Donald Trump's account since you are saving the worls?
I'm torn... is it good to have them suspended?  I'd think it would be better to lurk them and get a copy of their DMs.
Wait don't those Twitter accounts actually HELP intelligence keep track of fanatical elements?? If anything this is counterproductive... ISIS propaganda on some phantom account with 0 followers is futile to begin with.

Anon can save taxpayers by identifying and suspending TROLL accounts.. Genuine ones can potentially give leads
keep your friends close, and your enemies closer. wouldn't it have been better to turn the account names over to some governments so that they could monitor the accounts? Now the users will simply get news ones, and if the FBI or the CIA for example already knew about the other ones and were watching them, now they'll have to find the new accounts. And obviously the users will simply get new accounts.

This is like the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. Both hands are trying to wipe out ISIS but they one may be working against the other's progress.
Anon, doing shit the Nsa should have already done 
death by drone strike!
I love anonymous, its good to know there are people willing to try and do good in the world. Keep it up boys!
How about permanently banning them? Twitter sucks
Well, I hope they did a better job than the KKK list.  They screwed up KK Insurance with that list.  
Why did it take Paris for Anon to get involved? Over 200,000 people have died in Syria alone, wasn't that enough?
This feels like an old kaiju movie where the two monsters are fighting and your not sure who to cheer for.
Excellent work!
Good guy hacker group
That's what the fuck I am talking about son!
Fight the good fight. 
anon:isis::tea party:iran

Does not compute based on purported founding principles.
They should've' identified' them to French authorities, not publicly. Maybe then they could've gotten some intel.
alright I was wrong, my initial thought was "wtf is Anom going to do, isis uses 20th century technology" 

one instance im glad to be proven wrong
Real question here: when did Anonymous become a seeming "force for good?" I always used to hear about them with (at least in my mind) what seemed like a negative connotation. Over the past few years all I heard them do is fuck with people who deserve it.
This might sound like a dumb question and an extreme one but i wanted to ask if twitter can just disable all the accounts in all the ISIS controlled areas if they wanted?
Curious... Could somebody share one or two of their @? I'm curious to see.. 
Be careful! Your Clash of Clans profiles are next!

Bravo, anonymous.
We better not read a headline "700 more dead" due to the "war" these hackers are fighting.
You think ISIS browses Reddit?
ELI5: Why did anonymous stop exposing the cartels?  I read that article that the cartels were hiring security experts, but if there are hackers in Europe, would the cartels really send assassins to Europe?
I knew I always disliked twitter and twits for some reason.  First it was self-absorbed celebrities, now it's terrorists.
Atalanta?
You sure showed them, anonymous!
they will just sign up again
I like these anonymous guys
Bout time anonymous does something useful
What if there are sub reddits they are using.  How would reddit feel if the terrorists are here!
Twitter shouldn't have suspended them but gave them bunk access that doesn't really share their tweets while logging all they can in attempts to track down the users.
I'm sure it's been posted, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend. 
Or Anonymous are hacker gods or Twitter has an awful security.
WHO IS THIS 4CHAN!?
Love Anonymous. 
Excellent
So did Anonymous say anything about all the civilians and doctors killed in Lebanon, Afganistan, etc because of US/France/GB bombing? Just wondering. They are A LOT more than 130.
Because "free speech"
Let the fucking war begin you son's of bitch's
Now that they identified the accounts they can  analyze the emails associated with the accounts and then that could lead to addresses and ip addresses
I'm curious as to who exactly these "anonymous" are.. 4chan is confirmed dead for a while now. None of the people who have the expertise to make any sort of impact are part of the group at this point, it's literally just a bunch of teenagers.
I love these guys!
Wow, we're safe now.
Yeah - but did they put a french flag on their facebook picture?
ELi5, How come Anonymous can do this (id accounts) but not the State Department / Department of Defense and the boys n girls at the NSA?
I wondered why I woke up this morning and my account was suspended. I'm supper bummed out now :-(
would it not be easier to give those acc to the authorities? that way those people could be arrested»?
How many key figures does isis have? It seems like we have the same headline every other day

Yes, one will win, but I still need to kill the other.
Competing for Allah's love.
ISIS is originally an off-shoot of Al-Qaeda. Essentially, ISIS got too big for their britches and unilaterally declared themselves a caliphate, which Al-Qaeda opposed. Al-Qaeda are - believe it or not - the *moderates* here.

What if we give *Al Qeada* a ton of weapons, so they can take care of ISIS? This way we can get rid of ISIS and we don't even have to send any troops of our own. I mean, think about it - it's foolproof!

It took my mind a few seconds to grasp the shocking horror of cannibalistic existence that silently took place inside that inescapable sphere for so many years. My brain screamed in silent terror, so I went outside and took a cigarette break.

I don't know what made me think about that just now.
Things we didn't think we would be cheering for 10 years ago: Al Qaeda 

..... wooot?
let them fight.......
Really, no one going to post the obvious?  Heh (apologies if i missed it)

You know you've done something "special" when you've got the US, Russia, China, France, and *Al Qaeda* on the same side fighting against you.
Waiting for the CIA to tell us who the good guys are in this case.
The only response I have to this is "Lmao."
Well, it's a win win, I guess.

[Thanks, Al-qaeda....?](http://replygif.net/i/105.gif)
Whilst one terrorist blowing up another is a laugh n all that the whole worlds attention is kinda turned away from ALQ at the moment and that does worry me.   [Charles Lister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ozqk6Hc4e0k) talks about this a bit in this video.  

JaN is doing a bit of state building themselves in Syria and they happen to be both very effective( if not the most effective) fighters and more agreeable to the populations of areas they control and if I remember right ALQ sorta control a portion of Yemen now too? .
Good, fuck the both of them.

"Sometimes it is like seeing a wasp land on a stinging nettle. Someone is going to get hurt and you just don't care."

never thought i'd actually think to myself "good going, al-qaeda" one day.
So we have the 
US
China
France
Russia
NYC Mafia
and 
Al Qaeda 

fighting ISIS.  


ISIS wins the "Best Troll in History" Award 
As a Packer fan, this is the equivalent of me rooting for the Bears. 
I could be wrong but I feel like every week someone is taking out ISIS leaders and it's a "major blow". It's a non stop headline but ISIS never goes away. 
Al Qaeda is now the t-rex from Jurassic park.
They want each others' 72 virgins now it seems.

Please continue. When these wretches kill each other the world is the one who wins!

Also, does anyone remember how a Hezbollah (or was it someone else) leader publicly vowed to fight against ISIS a week or two ago?
Terrorists bombing terrorists. What a world. 
The enemy of my enemy is... no, wait. Still all enemies. Good luck to both sides?
This is Aladeen news!
Trying to figure out how many virgins they will get credit for, but the math is getting complicated.
Good guy Al Qaeda
...okay everyone move away slowly and let it happen
Will the real Islam please stand up.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FEEL
*In paradise*    
"Achmed! When we said mass killing by suicide, we meant the infidels--not us!"    
"You're just upset I got the virgins and you didn't!"    
*cue laugh track*    
"Suicide bombers--can't live with them, and neither can they!"    
*cue laugh track as theme song plays*
Turd sandwich or giant douche?
Ugh... Good job Al Qaeda? I guess
"Let them fight"
New report: Nazis have now attacked ISIS as well as those aliens from Independence Day.
Good guy Al Qaeda, he seems cool. 
These Al Qaeda guys sound OK to me, we should give them some weapons to help them fight our enemies. 
So we're friends with Al Qaeda again? Like when we created them to fight the Russians?
Im not sure how I feel about this
So do we even have a rough estimate about how many Isis militants there are? We continuously have been hearing "300 Isis members surrender", "37 Isis members killed" but is this really a significant amount? Obviously not all Muslims are terrorists or there would be over a billion of them. It sounds like Isis is relatively small. 
Wait, who is Al-Nursa allied with? The FSA?
OK, this is getting too confusing, is there any way I can understand WTF is going on, who is attacking who and why???
uhm good job Al qaeada?
Not sure who to root for.
man is this shit getting confusing
What the fuck is going on with this conflict!?!

Good guy Al Qaeda. Wait, what?
ALLAH IS PLEASED.
Al Qaeda NUMBER 1. ISIS NUMBER 19. 
Umm, go Al Qaeda?  Great..job?  Thank..you??
you know you are a horrible group when other horrible groups try to snuff you out
Does this mean we're on the same side as Al Qaeda now?
#Fuck you America! You don't kill us! We kill us!!!
This is like a market. They are killing the competition, ISIS made people forget about Al Qaeda. 
Ugh. Al Qaeda is so twenty twelve. 
People are actually cheering on Al-Qaeda...
Thanks Al Qaeda?
/r/unexpectedjihad ?
Some of the best news I have ever heard
wait wait wait wait... these two fuckers don't like each other? 
Well thanks Al Qaeda , i guess
We're not at war with Eastasia. We're at war with Eurasia. We've always been at war with Eurasia.

Sounds like Spy vs Spy from MAD Magazine.
Sometimes dicks fuck assholes, assholes who just want to shit on everybody ...
Can everyone else just sort of back away, whistling to themselves, and let these two duke it out?
Let the bastards take each other out. We need more Intel on potential attacks against America and Allies, not more troops and bombs.
[This sums up how everyone feels](https://media.giphy.com/media/VzbN9gupkkXp6/giphy.gif)
Jeez now the extremists can't get along? What is this world coming to
Feels like the end of Jurassic Park where the T-Rex fights the Raptors

Except yknow.... it's terrorists...
Thanks Al Qaeda. We still can't be friends though.

No offence to the commenters in this thread but out of interest if I want to read relevant discussion of news and not memed-out karma whoring cheap laugh farming shitposts, what sub should I go to?
If this headline is in the least bit surprising to you, please, please, please finally read the Atlantic article [What ISIS Really Wants](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/) that gets mentioned on reddit periodically. I finally took the 30 minutes to read it and it was like the scales* fell from my eyes and I could see. You owe it to yourself to have some idea of what's going on here.

I've searched high and low for rebuttals to the piece and haven't found any meaningful ones, but would love to hear how/if it's wrong. The only thing that comes up is a thinkprogress piece on a tangent of a tangent about how Islamic ISIS is. But I haven't found anything actually talking about whether "what ISIS really wants" is what the article says, and that's the important part.

*Yes, Bible quote. Kinda freaky sounding, I know.
It's like a cheesy superhero movie where the old nemesis helps the heroes fight the new villain. Fuck Al Qaeda too, though.
Al Qaeda deserves no props for this.   They deserve no congratulations. They are still as much the scum of the Earth as ISIS.
So we've got like a serious alien vs predator thing developing?
Awesome! Has the US started to fund these moderate rebels yet???
Hopefully they just take each other out. 
I sincerely hope that suicide bomber gets those virgins he was promised...

That tasted funny coming out. 
From what I can gather, ISIS is fighting:

* United States
* France
* Russia
* China (recently)
* Iran
* Iraq
* Syria
* Kurdistan
* Rojava (SDF/YPG)
* Al-Qaeda
* Hezbollah


Wow. ISIS *really* kinda fucked themselves there. Now it's only a matter of time before they become a memory.
Is the US working with al-queda again?
In a reasonable world, this is the point at which the U.S. looks around, then backs out quietly.
Using suicide bombers to take out the suicide bombers before they can suicide bomb your suicide bombers.
The irony would be insurmountable if the US started providing Al-Qaeda with guns and training.
I'm doing the work of Allah. NO, I WAS HERE FIRST! I'M DOING THE WORK OF ALLAH.
Wanna go dutch on the 72 virgins???
in be4 17 year old teenage girls who hate their first world life join Al Qaeda to fight ISIS

Obama disapproves.
Oh my god. I went to Foxnews.com and read comments. 
Reddit, I take back all the bad things I said about you. 

Actually no, I don't. Many of you are still dumb fucks. But at least you can always pat yourself on the back for not being as bad as the angry/scared old people who frequent foxnews. Holy shit. 
nothing makes me more suspicious of ISIS's origins and secret alliances then the fact that Al Qaeda is fighting them.
WHAT THE FUCK LOL? This is some Maury shit.
Syria is like a soap opera with less makeup and more people dying. A bunch of different groups and countries fighting and cooperating in a tangled web.
This makes me feel warm inside.
"Let them fight!"
When the title of your group becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy...

&gt; In a defiant statement released on social media, the **Yarmouk Martyrs Brigade** responded, “The martyrdom of the leaders will only make us more determined. Blood and sacrifice is welcome for God’s sake.”
I just imagine two guys sitting in the muslim version of a bar.  One guy makes eye contact with some other guy and realizes hes from a rival terror group.  They get in each others faces talking shit.  Thing escalate as they are both wearing suicide vests.

They go outside for a Western showdown.  The sun hits the highest point and they both charge each other.  On this day Al Qaeda had the fast bomb trigger in the land.
Just like the old saying. The enemy of my enemy is my other enemy.
Two for none.
The enemy of my enemy is my ... enemy? hahaha
Is this some kind of bullshit?
http://i.imgur.com/neSyKEh.gif
Who will quickly be replaced by another leader.. 
Go...Al Qaeda?

That was weird to think/type.
Somebody get that guy some virgins!
ISIS used to be AQ in Iraq under Jordanian Al-Zaqawi and were too brutal that OBL and AQ's current leader condemned for killing so many Muslims. AQ isn't worth cheering as they still want to destroy western civilization.

Edit: minus 1 still
I guess its win win for us, however this is ridiculous.. 
While ISIS is talked about as the biggest threat, I still think Al-Qaeda is the stronger group and has a greater capability for global coordinated attacks.  Al-Qaeda has been using all the attention on ISIS to its advantage and has been building up forces in Somalia, Libya,Yemen, and Pakistan.  
DOUBLE KILL
I love it when problems sort themselfs out. 
Wasn't ISIS Al Qaeda in Iraq?

We have moved beyond clusterfuck 
This is like that South Park episode.
oh i dont know if to laugh or cry at this thread....dont you people realize that this is NOT good news , but BAD, BAD news. Dont envision ISIS vs AL Quaeda as a nation vs nation war to the end. They share very similar ideology , and this is a struggle for power and control. WHoever wins becomes way stronger as it will most likely absorb and integrate most forces of the looser.
edit : It's not at all like isis/alquaeda vs west , thats what i mean. They wanna exterminate us and we wanna exterminate them , but they most likely want to asimilate not exterminate alquaeda. Hope this makes sense
edit 2 : They draw from the same pool of recruits , share the same ideology. I for one  would rather it stay 2 smaller groups rather than a big one
Now all they need to do is donate a puppy to France and wait for the induction to the /r/worldnews circlejerk.
Why are we not arming these guys?
That feeling when you read about an Al Quaeda action.. and then you feel happy about it.
This ISIS vs the world thing reminds me of Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert and Command &amp; Conquer: Generals.

Huh ...ain't that some shit....

so is Al Qaeda good now?

How many "key" ISIS leaders have been taken out so far? 
Whoo! Al Qaeda #1! Our greatest allies in the war on terror, along with Russia!

The fuck, guys. 
/r/ConfusedBoner
I've lost track of how many sides this war has.
Great...because this war wasn't complicated enough with Iran, USA, Russia, France, and China all inexplicably on the same side...yet none can agree on who exactly should actually lead the country once the dust had settled...then along comea Al Quaeda and tosses their hat into the circle of oh-fuck-me...great real great...I'll make the popcorn you build the bomb shelter? 
This is more complicated than Game of Thrones. U.S. at odds with Russia. NATO all allies with Turkey but now possibly kicking them out. Turkey fighting Russia. China joining everyone else in trying to take out ISIS. Now long time enemy of everyone Al Qaeda helps in taking out ISIS. This shit is super complicated 
It's like my colon cancer is killing my herpes. 
This is a strange place.
That's the problem with Chaotic Evil troops.  It's only a matter of time 'til some go rogue and internecine warfare breaks out.

Al-Qaeda bombing ISIS now?  
Let me bring my popcorn...

First time in my life I heard of a suicide bombing and went "yeah! Fuck yeah!"
The enemy of my enemy....


Still a bunch of assholes tbh.
Isis should probably retaliate against these Al Qaeda folks, they could pose a serious threat

*Please just all kill each other*
"Let them fight"
SO the started losing and now they are team killing.... noobs
...yay, Al Qaeda...?
I think the real question is, "When one terrorist blows up another terrorist, who gets the virgins?"
I'm not seeing a problem here.
[This seems relevant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_1sFxAmb7g&amp;ab_channel=hetkaashuis)
They should both have some sort of suicide bomber battle. Let them thin their number fighting themselves, then take out the remainder. Thanks asoiaf for prepping me for political intrigues. 
So why don't we just enrage them against each other and let them sterilize their own selves. Leave the rest of the world alone.
Uh... Thanks? 
You could say it was... mind-blowing...

So they killed someone and want to sue a person over a comment they made?  
While they're at it, sign me up for a lawsuit, too. Killing people because they have different beliefs seems to me to be the epitome of ISIS like behavior. 
Today children we learn about the Streisand effect, featuring Saudi Arabia. 
Silly Saudis

How can you sue someone for telling the truth?
They are isis-like...... now try and sue me
Fuck its gonna be glorious watching Saudi crumble as the oil industry dies.
What's the difference between ISIS and Saudi Arabia? 

Statehood 

Can you image that?

President of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, your family "House of Saud", your sons, daughters, relatives, sheikhs; in some way or another are literally just like ISIS. The fact that your country will kill someone over some fucking poem shows how little your minds are, JUST LIKE ISIS.

Fuck The House of Saud, and Fuck ISIS. I hope that man haunts you, Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, here and in the afterlife --may you share the same pit in Hell with ISIS and your supporting Family and friends suffering the same fate that man went through, every day, only to wake up just to be hung by your neck *again* by GOD himself..

We can bitch all we want but shit ain't changing while oil is still valuable and we still want to fuck around in the Middle East for whatever reason 
Saudia Arabia is the ISIS that made it.
They probably could have avoided comparisons to ISIS by not funding the rise of ISIS.
Saudi Arabia invented militant Islam and has directed, financed, and championed the worldwide spread of violent jihad. They're just insulted that their brand of insanity is being mistaken for Daesh's knockoff flavor of insanity.
*Saudi Arabia to Lose Twitter Lawsuit*
"Register for free to continue reading", FUCK OFF !!!!!!
That's a good idea, so let me go ahead and kick things off by stating LOUDLY and clearly:
I think that Saudi Arabia's execution of the poet Ashraf Fayadh is HIGHLY reminiscent, if not IDENTICAL to the psychotic mentality that drives the terrorist group known as ISIS.
I have NOTHING but contempt and utter disdain for the Saudi Government and the Saudi Royal family for this act.
If the Saudi Government and royal family is offended by this comment, my response is simply to raise my middle finger to your face (and also throw my shoes at you, since that also seems offensive in your culture).
Just in case I was not clear enough: Saudi Government and Saudi Royal family: you TOTALLY SUCK, and are the SAME as ISIS when you commit acts like this, such as executing poets like Ashraf Fayadh.
If you would like to file a formal law suit against me, I WELCOME it. Just PM and I'll give you my contact information.
I fully welcome the challenge of a law suit, and the further media attention I will make sure it brings to your insanity and psychotic ways, and can't wait to see you in court.AllThatJazz
There should be a sub-reddit title /r/SaudiArabiaisISIS and then people can post all the crap that takes place in Saudi Arabia that is exactly like the things done by ISIS.
saudi arabia to start suing individual people across the world for calling them Isis-like, barbaric terrorists. If convicted, they will stone the perpetrators in public (they bury the individual and keep the head exposed) while families and children gather to watch and participate. 

Edit: my bad, this only happens to their own citizens.
Fuck you Saudi Arabia. I'll go even farther. You're worse than ISIS. There is only two differences between you and them. You are fat and corrupt with UN approval. And instead of openly sponsoring terrorism, you sponsor terrorism in secret.

Also, your prophet is a fraud and you will die not as holy men but as decadent garbage who left the world worse off than when you came into it.
The only difference I can tell between ISIS and Saudi Arabia is that the Saudis haven't explicitly stated that they want to destroy the U.S.
Truth hurts fuckers.
The question is: what country is the Twitter user from?
Saudi Arabia continues to be a menace, but the US won't do shit because of the oil.
Hey Saudi Arabia - come sue me!  I've said the same thing plenty of times!  In fact here you go!

A nation run by religious nonsense in 2015 is a travesty. What separates humanity from the rest of the animals is our ability to use evidence, logic and reason to guide our actions and thoughts, to piece together seemingly separate observations when they come together to give us a greater insight into things.

What makes SOME people MORE like the rest of the animals, is this retarded tribalistic bullshit that they are pushing.
[deleted]
I agree, Saudi Arabia are very similar to ISIS in the sense that they deem it acceptable to behead people who decide to stand against them, choose to leave their religion, or just because they think for themselves. I am ashamed that we have long been associated with such an abhorrent culture.
I can't read the news article because the website requires me to sign up to do so. Sums up the state of the internet nowadays perfectly. 
I'm pretty sure the problem SA has with being called ISIS-like is that they're the innovator but everybody is giving credit to ISIS.  What everyone should be doing is calling ISIS Saudi Arabia-like
Dear saudi, 

We are not impressed with your high moral values. You are next on the list. Mark our words, iran will survive this, you most likely will not once that oil dries out. That money will not last long with those spending practices either. Your days are numbered. 

I am actually excited about watching it collapse. It WILL be comical, watching the rich become beggars. 
In my opinion every beheading Saudi Arabia allows is Daesh-like.

Every time Saudi Arabia passes a punishment based on a holy books rules is Daesh-like.

Every time a woman or minority in Saudi Arabia is oppressed is Daesh -like.

Come to think of it, the way Saudi Arabia runs their country is rather Daesh-like.

*edit: typos*
Saudi Arabia's death sentences are Daesh-like in part because of their [shared interpretations on Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahhabism#Wahhabis_and_Salafis). 
Evidently, I've reached my limit this month of free articles.  Fuck this scumbag site.
I have run out of things to say about Saudi Arabia. The country is the moral anus of the world and we should stop calling it an ally. 
Fuck Saudi Arabia.

Great, then can we sue them for 9/11 ?
Can you really call it faith if they kill you for not believing?
How it or normally goes down:


Saudi Prince: Who is this Twitter user that questions us? We must execute him at once.


Advisor: But Sir, he doesn't live in Saudi Arabia, he lives in a 1st world country with human rights


Prince: Oh, ok. What do people do there if someone accuses them? 


Advisor: ah..... They normally sue them. 

Prince: Excellent idea, advisor. We shall sew his mouth shut and he shall never talk again. For this idea, I give you 15 oil wells.


Advisor: Sir, I meant sue them in a court of law. 


Prince: court of law? What in Oil's name is that? Ah... Very well. This will have to do

fuck the saudi king with a  pineapple!!
Going after someone for criticizing them?

Sounds pretty ISIS-Like
Saudi Arabia, the home of Wahhabism which was spawned al qaeda, ISIS, and numerous other Islamic extremist groups. Lets not forget that most, if not all these groups are funded and supported by the Saudi government...the very same government that claims to be the friend and ally of the United States.     
Saudi Arabia is a pathetic country. Fuck those disgusting pigs.
Well it's a sensitive subject, given that all the royal relatives are funding ISIS.
Saudi Arabia is just a richer version of ISIS, and if they disagree, let them prove it.
Why were their feelings hurt? Maybe the Saudi's need to grow a pair and learn to deal with it.
Saudi Arabia's death sentence is ISIS-Like.
I feel bad for people who have to live in Saudi Arabia, under the thumb of an insane king who sees them as cattle . . . 
Fuck the Saudis. They're such evil fucks protected by their oil. Once that loses it's importance (and the day will come) that country's done as fuck.
Wait.... We can sue people for saying mean things on the internet? 

*searches reddit history*

I'm gonna be rich as fuck! 
That's very ISIS-like of them.
ISIS are all wabbahist . Saudi Arabia is solely responsible for the spread of a small sect of islam throughout the world. It wasn't an accident all the 9/11 hijackers were saudis. It's like giving the westboro church 1 trillion dollars.
My interpretation of wahabbism is that it exists to justify what they really want to do.. prey on their fellow man like raiders, robbers and highway men .   They simply want to rob, murder and rape.  So that's what they do.  They don't even deny it.   
Saudi Arabia is America's ally while we fought for freedom in secular Iraq. Think about that. 
The question is: what country is the Twitter user from?
Ladies and gentlemen, our UN head of human rights. 
Saudi Arabia is easily second North Korea if not worse...
I think that Saudi Arabia's execution of the poet Ashraf Fayadh is HIGHLY reminiscent, if not IDENTICAL to the psychotic mentality that drives the terrorist group known as ISIS.

Rich Saudi's fund ISIS. They should be proud of the comparison.
Saudi Arabia has to go away. Imagine those assholes following the rest of us out to space, they will ruin everything.

the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is ISIS-like.
Saudi Arabia is the head of the UN Human Rights Council. I shit you not.
Saudi Arabia needs its safe space
What is the link to their twitter that they are suing people from?

In addition to comments on the right to freedom of speech I also have a lot of pictures of goats they might like. 
May they all fall out of their drifting Camry's, assholes.
Saudi Arabia is DAESH 
Wait, are they trying to say it isn't?!
is there any way to read that anywhere without an unremovable popup?
How is this suppose to work out? If the Twitter user is American, he/she has freedom of speech. 
How Un-ISIS of them too punish free speech
The saudi condemned somebody to death for apostasy (ie made up religious reasons) ? That definitely looks like islamism fundamentalism. And is definitely not adapted for the 21st century and a country that want to modernize.
Let's hope the Twitter user in question doesn't live in or anywhere near that barbaric hell hole.
Wow at this rate Saudis will be overrun by Isis easily
It would be great if that kingdom would get off its ass and contribute to stopping this problem.
Saudi Arabia in general is very Daeshish.  Sue me.
Saudi Arabia needs some murican "freedom"
They use our laws against us. 

What I find odd is that we need to abide by their rules when over there. 

However, we also need to abide by their rules when they're over here. 

WTF!
There once was a Saudi Arabia

Who would kill you for prose about labia


Fuck you Saudi scum, we have something called freedom of speech. I wish someone would call them out on all their disgusting abuse against humans.
Twitter user encourages Saudi Arabia to suck a fat dick.
I just realized I have been censoring myself. Normally, I have no problem going on Facebook and ranting about this or that when it comes to United States domestic policy or some bigot saying ridiculous things on national television. Yet, there seems to be this cognitive breakdown with my liberal friends where they have somehow convinced themselves that any critique of Islam or countries that are Islamic nations is somehow "Islamophobia" regardless of context. Now, instead of being able to discuss things like this article I feel the need to walk on eggshells for fear of backlash from people who are otherwise intellectual peers. 

Fuck Saudi Arabia. 
Hahaha, good luck with that... Free speech hurt much? They are ridiculous.

It was a fair critic from the user, and he would be already beheaded if he was in their totalitarian country.
I kinda feel bad for the guy.

Well maybe they shouldn't act so much like ISIS, prosecuting a man for his separation from the Muslim faith.

Seriously though, fuck the House of Saud, and fuck 'King' Salma.  They shit on basic human rights, especially in regards to womens rights, and their pathetic execution of Sharia law to keep themselves in power is a grand show in cowardice.

Saudi Arabia IS fucking ISIS; *There is no difference*.

They are the very antithesis of everything cultured, progressive and in a word, enlightened.

They are the "Nazis" of the current times.


You know what else is ISIS-like? Forcing me to register if I want to read more than 2 paragraphs of your fucking article, Newsweek.
Fuck Saudi Arabia and their medieval bullshit

I think that Saudi Arabia's execution of the poet Ashraf Fayadh is HIGHLY reminiscent, if not IDENTICAL to the psychotic mentality that drives the terrorist group known as ISIS. I have NOTHING but contempt and utter disdain for the Saudi Government and the Saudi Royal family for this act. If the Saudi Government and royal family is offended by this comment, my response is simply to raise my middle finger to your face (and also throw my shoes at you, since that also seems offensive in your culture). Just in case I was not clear enough: Saudi Government and Saudi Royal family: you TOTALLY SUCK, and are the SAME as ISIS when you commit acts like this, such as executing poets like Ashraf Fayadh. If you would like to file a formal law suit against me, I WELCOME it. Just PM and I'll give you my contact information. I also fully authorize the admins at Reddit to release my IP address to the Saudi Government upon request. I fully welcome the challenge of a law suit, and the further media attention I will make sure it brings to your insanity and psychotic ways, and can't wait to see you in court.


Could you imagine being that guy? 

"Holy fuck a whole country is suing me"

Like damn, write that on your resume if you live
Saudi Arabia - your killings in the name of religious purity are disgusting acts which operate on the same basis as any other terrorism: do what we say, think what we want, or we kill you. You're ISIS-Like.  I have nothing for you to take. Join us in the future, and have a good day.
Saudaesh Arabia

There was a great op-ed in the New York Times last week called [Saudi Arabia, an ISIS That Has Made It](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/21/opinion/saudi-arabia-an-isis-that-has-made-it.html?_r=0).
But no guys lets still act like Islam is a good thing that can be hijacked by bad people. kinda hard to say that when a whole fucking Arab country follows sharia law with minimal backlash from its own people. Fuck Islam and fuck religion. It is the bane of humanity. All it will do is continue to hold back our progression as a species.
The saudi arabian poet's death sentence is ISIS-Like. 
I sense lots of hate towards Saudi Arabia. My suggestion: form a kickstarter and put a massive hit on their whole family. Market will take care of the rest. Strategy would go as follows: we kill most of their princes on foreign countries. Rest will flee and go exactly where we want them to: back home. Easy to finish them off then in one single coordinated attack. To make this reality, we need several billion dollar hit. I'm sure you can do it reddit, surely, considering other bullshit "charities" people waste their money on.
So now people can't disagree with them? What a pathetic excuse for a nation. I see no reason for Putin to stop after Isis is defeated. Saudi Arabia could clearly use a revolution. 
The beheading sentencing of poet Ashraf Fayadh is indeed an ISIS-like, Daesh-like sentence. Don't like that statement, Saudi Arabia? Too bad, you backwards, barbaric wahabbists.

They are ISIS like. Their culture, their law, their beliefs, etc. Its all VERY ISIS like.
Hey Saudi Arabia, fuck you.
Saudi Arabia is living in the middle age, they can drive fancy cars and shit but they immediately look stolen with a Saudi on the wheel.
They executed him for abandoning his faith? That *is* ISIS -Like. 
I thinks it's funny how they call themselves, "royal."  Since when are sand knee grows royal?  
I think that Saudi Arabia killing that poet makes them seem EXACTLY like ISIS. 
Matt and Trey this thing is fucking calling your names.
Fuck you Mohammad. fuck you Islam, fuck you religion.  Fuck you god, fuck you Jesus.  Fuck you.
I don't know much about SAUDI ARABIA but if what I hear IS true on local news stations then they are not EXACTLY LIKE ISIS.

And it is completely in their right to TRY AND SUE people like you and ME for acting like ASSHOLES because we hurt their feelings.

Honestly. We are the problem, and deeP . Somewhere inside I think we all know SAUDI ARABIA is right.  How CAN we as a people learn to stop SUCKing up the media's lies. It's no MYstery, we are all a MASSIVE group of  APOSTATEs and need to stop like acting like DICKs.
Fuck it. I'll flat out say it. Saudi Arabia is Isis. Its all the same stupid muslim shit. Fuck ISIS and Fuck every Saudi Prince/king that ever existed. If you're reading this Saudis.. FUCK YOU and islam.

Saudi Arabia... the land who's kings who have sex with dogs... because they enjoy it so much

Fuck Saudi Arabia
&gt; Questioning the fairness of the courts is to question the justice of the Kingdom and its judicial system based on Islamic law, which guarantees rights and ensures human dignity

What a riot. I'm sure Saudi freethinkers living under threat of beheading are reassured that their "human dignity" is still intact.

What a barbaric, ISIS-like government/legal system.


CAN YOU NOT LINK TO A BULLSHIT SITE THAT MAKES YOU REGISTAR TO READ THE ARTICLE!!!!
I know that the Saudi government is really messed up but had a friend in college who was from Saudi Arabia and he was the nicest and most generous person I ever met. Sure his parents were giving him 10 k a month for spending cash but still. He also refused to talk to girls but that's just their culture and religion. So I'd like to think not everybody from Saudi Arabia is barbaric. Just most of the people in charge and in the Royal family. Kinda analogous to those in power and higher ups in the United States. Just way more in the open about it 
Saudi Arabia is pretty much ISIS with money so its no really surprising
Thank god they are in the UN human rights council. 
ISIS is Saudi like.

How does this work exactly? How can a nation sue someone when they are in a nation where free speech is protected? Is this something that can be done legally? can someone explain?

Come on Saudi Arabia, modernize the fuck up. I'm not slandering Islam, but come on, it's 2015, not 15 AD. If your still in a position where you feel the need to kill people for expressing their thoughts and ideas then I hope ISIS gets a hold of you, so you can feel what religious opression feels like. I hope God/Allah does exist, and he shits on you in the afterlife for your need to act as you are God, judging people and condemning them to death based off of their ideology, and their expression of it.

Btw, the only reason people deal with you, and the only reason you're wealthy is oil. Take that away, and you have nothing but sand.

I had no idea this was even possible.   I hate this globalized world, not only do you have to deal with BS in your own country, but BS in others too, and it seems it's heading more and more in that direction these days, ex: TPP.  Soon we'll pretty much have to walk on egg shells for every action we take because someone anywhere in the world can sue you for it or otherwise cause you harm. 

Also, I HATE modals, especially ones that you can't even exit from. I could barely read the article because it was blocking my view. People who code those should be shot.

What a weird world we live in lol
saudi arabia is daesh. Murdering a poet. What the unholy fuck?
Middle-eastern people are the most oversensitive people alive. Do they spend all day crying and plotting murder?
Saudi Arabia supports Daesh, and may as well be a part of them too, considering what they do to people.
I love the sentiment, fuck you saudi arabia.  But if you want to be better, if you want to really stick it to them, personal freedoms should be at the top of your list.  Places like saudi arabia, they have freedom and free people.

They like restricting personal freedoms.  So they want lots of people in prisons for victimless crimes like drugs, varieties of sex, ageist/discriminatory laws and so on.  

So, maybe, do the opposite of saudi arabia?

Not being able to laugh at yourself is a major red flag in terms of rationality. 
So apparently you can sue individuals...not from your own country &amp; not adhering to your small-minded beliefs...because you disagree &amp; you've never heard of freedom of speech.

Sounds like another Middle East litterbox the US should take to task; you can't sugarcoat this egregious ignorance. This is a hot, steaming pile of 100% baseless shit. If I sued everyone that offended me, hell, I'd be a billionaire. But I've got things that traditionally come with maturity &amp; manhood: dignity &amp; a thick skin. I hope Saudi Arabia gets backhanded into submission.

FUCKKKKKKK ISSSSSSSSSSLAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!
Sounds like something ISIS would do.
So let's say the guy that they're going to sue lives in the United States. Can they tell Saudi Arabia to fuck off and shove the lawsuit up their ass? Because if they can sue a random Twitter user for something so goddamn trivial and stupid, it sets a dangerous precedent.

Next we'll be hearing about North Korea suing a Youtuber for calling Kim Jong-Un fat.
Saudi Arabia feeds, nurtures and funds the Muslim religious fundamentalism that helped create ISIS, Al-Quada, Boka Haram, etc...

Liberal Democracy and Religious fundamentalism/conservatism do not mix. All religions are guilty. 


cant they just tell them to fuck off??? does this also mean we can sue saudi arabia for things?

You can't sue free speech...
Crucible, anybody? Do you dare question the goodness of these courts? Anybody? It's not Islam that's the problem, it's entitled cunts twisting religion (bullshit for the record) to control idiots. 
That country is as backwards as it gets. There is no freedom, no progression. All of the population is oppressed. Half the population aren't even treated as human beings (women). 

So sad to see that this is 2015 and we are "friends" with that nation. If they didn't have copious amounts of money and power they would be next to nothing, which is what I already think of them. Their ideology is extreme and they no different than ISIS.

Saudi Arabia, your "nation" sucks. I spit in my shoes and chuck them at your King. You are a vile, evil, backwards, immoral, dishonorable, malicious, sinister, demonic, sorry-excuse for a human being.

There is no difference between Saudi and ISIS. You are both the same to me. You are both terrorists of the body and mind.

Not making the point you think you are Saudi Arabia.

Hah. They can't handle the truth. They're just like ISIS. Don't like that, Saudi Arabia? Then stop acting like ISIS.
Man, FUCK Saudi Arabia

They're a bunch of shitheads that say one thing and do another.

The gov't that is - the normal, everyday people, could be just fine
guys i think they are mad.  can someone make a sweet image macro to illustrate how Saudi Arabia is so Daesh-like (apparently isis dont like to be called daesh)
Saudi Arabia killed an innocent poet. Their actions are Isis like. 
Fuck Saudi Arabia.
Interesting to note: When the Wahhabis came to power in the 18th centruy their brand of brutal sharia interpretation was not common. In fact, when Abdal Wahhab stoned a woman for adultery the Muslim word was shocked. (For more information on this, check out pg. 62 of "[The Great Theft: " by Khaled About El Fadl](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Theft-Wrestling-Islam-Extremists/dp/0061189030/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448512763&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+great+theft)) 

This brand of brutal punishing was unique to the Wahhabis when they came to power, and was not the common practice. But ever since the British switched their Navy to oil around 1914 and showed interest in Saudi Arabia, then the oil crisis of the 70s sent billions of dollars into Saudi Arabia, the Wahhabis of Saudi Arabia were in the perfect position to export their brand of Islam to the rest of the world. Since all Muslims when to Mecca for Pilgrimage, the Saudis and thus the Wahhabis, had control of who could go. Scholars and Jurists were hesitant to criticize the Wahhabis for fear of being barred from being able to go to Mecca, or worse, being punished once they arrived. 

So the combination of crazy Wahhabi ideology with trillions of dollars in oil money pouring in from all over the world, has created the current situation. It is really sad. 
The San Diego Zoo has frozen cells and sperm of twelve individuals. They plan to bring them back.
&gt;Only 3 northern white rhinos left on Earth

&gt;The species is widely considered on the brink of extinction

I wonder who that one guy is who is like "nu uh, three is plenty"
Some background info on white rhinos. The "northern" and "southern" are almost genetically identical. There are a few RNA markers that can tell them apart in a lab, but they're the same animal for all intents and purposes. The distinction between the two subspecies is almost entirely geographical.
&gt;In every remote corner of the world there are people like Carl Jones and Don Merton who have devoted their lives to saving threatened species. Very often, their determination is all that stands between an endangered species and extinction.
But why do they bother? Does it really matter if the Yangtze river dolphin, or the kakapo, or the northern white rhino, or any other species live on only in scientists' notebooks?
Well, yes, it does. Every animal and plant is an integral part of its environment: even Komodo dragons have a major role to play in maintaining the ecological stability of their delicate island homes. If they disappear, so could many other species. And conservation is very much in tune with our survival. Animals and plants provide us with life-saving drugs and food, they pollinate crops and provide important ingredients or many industrial processes. Ironically, it is often not the big and beautiful creatures, but the ugly and less dramatic ones, that we need most.
Even so, the loss of a few species may seem irrelevant compared to major environmental problems such as global warming or the destruction of the ozone layer. But while nature has considerable resilience, there is a limit to how far that resilience can be stretched. No one knows how close to the limit we are getting. The darker it gets, the faster we're driving.
There is one last reason for caring, and I believe that no other is necessary. It is certainly the reason why so many people have devoted their lives to protecting the likes of rhinos, parakeets, kakapos, and dolphins. And it is simply this: the world would be a poorer, darker, lonelier place without them.

-Douglas Adams
3...FUCKING 3? God I hope they are not of the same sex..
SD Zoomember here. Nola was a G. She will be missed.  
goodbye white rhinos, hello truth of global ecological change made by humans. 
We won?
How the fuck are they getting to outer space? 
There is something very disturbing about the idea of extinction. One day an animal that has been on this earth for thousands of years with a genetic history stretching back to the start of life on earth is going to stop being here. That's it, after all these years after all they did and their ancestors did to survive, everything ends at the hands of humans. That's it, done because people wanted some horns.  Some fucking horns.
&gt;Owning a rhino horn is also something of a status symbol in some parts of the world, such as the urban centers of Vietnam.

I find it strange that this leaves out the use of rhino horn for knife handles and other status objects for the wealthy of the Arabian peninsula.
Got to see the old girl almost 2 years ago while visiting the SD park.  I felt privileged, then sad. 
One of them is the ultimate 3rd wheel
I wish the title was "Only 3 ISIS members left on Earth" instead.

Goodbye white rhinos.
Goodbye my friends.
You have been the ones.
You have been the ones for me.
Guess that Runescape promotion didn't really help
Don't tell me.  Two of them are gay.
each and every poacher deserved the worst pain imaginable.

slow, torturous deaths.
Good. We are wasting money preserving endangered species that we will be able to bring back in the future if we ever need them. Right now we don't need them,  so they can die off until they are economically beneficial. 
I don't get it -if they are being poached to extinction for their horns, why are they not being farmed? Easier to breed them for profit than kill off your profit margin.
Yeah but think of how many Chinese boners we got out of them.
Not a viable population. They are extinct.
3 northern white rhinos is not "widely considered" to be on the brink of extinction.  It is in any sense of the term on the brink of extinction. Irreversibly so.    

By comparison, the southern white rhinos are doing okay. The genetic difference between the two is at the subspecies level. 



&gt; on Earth
Serious question: why is it important to fight against natural selection and try to hold tight to animals that are going extinct? Aren't something like 99% of all species that ever existed extinct? 
I mean, they don't really DO anything.

They're like 2nd rate triceratops.
I never understood why people care so much if a species goes extinct. They do that all the time and have done so before there were humans of any kind. 

In addition to that, some species just aren't very apt at survival. Take panda bears for example. Big, hulking animal, eats only a very select sort of plants, has to eat all day not to starve under its own weight. Fuck, that's just inefficient.
WHitelivesmatter
Well lets get cloning.
How many Southern White Rhinos left?
I hope they bang

They're such beautiful animals!
ITT: 75 same #whiterhinolivesmatter jokes
As a doctor but not a vet, I hope this planned IVF works, and the species does not go extinct. 
Oh no, my family
Saw one of them at the San Diego Zoo a few weeks ago. A certain sadness set over me once I realized such a beautiful creature would soon be gone. I hope our conservation and repopulation efforts work.
It is really sad to see people hunting rhinos in the world for their horns and leisure purposes, and the fact that I am Chinese makes me ashamed in my own culture how people are so naive into using expensive things as medicine. 
Guess White Rhinos won't be a thing for our next generation. Sorry on behalf of us, the Chinese.
They're virtually extinct. Just like the majority of all living creatures. So no one should be upset. (mock-sarcasm)
kill them, get it over with.
*"Capitalism would never cause a depletion of a resource, oh no! You see if you just let the market be free, price will automatically increase to meet demand. So the last bit of resource will costs trillions of dollars and no-one can afford it. All hail capitalism and fuck the state's monopoly on violence, harr harr harr harr!"*

/s
/r/overpopulation
How do we know there isn't a guy out there who just has a horde of them stacked away, breeding them quietly? 
That is one of the reason why I fucking hate traditional Chinese medicine. This bullshit is completely useless and meaningless for medical purpose.
Can't they just mate with some of the southern white rhinos?

Why don't we just clone it 
I thought that a species could be considered extinct before all it's members have died because of the inability to reproduce sufficiently  could that be the case here
If i wanted to purchase one of these from the black market. What would you think it would cost me?
Good job humanity, one down, a few millions to go
Any effort to repopulate this species is doomed to fail. They will sadly be truly extinct before long. Good job humanity.
Poachers: *'Yay! 3 northern white rhino horns! That'll fetch a bundle!'*
3 is not enough to bring them back :(
Just die already. 
A "northern white rhino" seems a bit specific. I am more concerned with rhinos in general. I mean, If you get too specific, then everything will become endangered.
I blame Abzan for being so popular.
Surgery was a success but the patient died. 
Maybe its time to open season on poachers.  Hopefully they will get extinct too.
Humans are just toughening up the world. We are raising the survival standards of all species but our own. Consider it a selfless act that ultimately kills us while weeding out the weaker animals. We are so nice.
[George Carlin on saving things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W33HRc1A6c)
Okay so this is gonna go negative to reddit, but why should we even care if three are left on this planet? Species go extinct all the time, and it seems like these are done for. Considering there are only 3 left, seems like any species down from this series will be severely inbred and the chances of them surviving are very low. So why don't we just like stop caring about these rhinos and care more about other species to stop them from getting this far down to extinction?
&gt; after having been hunted down to miniscule numbers by poachers primarily for their horns. In parts of Asia, rhino horn is sold at exorbitant prices for its supposed (but unproven ) medicinal purposes.

[**Yes!** It's those evil Asians again!](http://www.endangeredrag.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rhino-with-us-flag.jpg)
And... They're gone
Serious, why is it not ok for them to just go extinct?  How many animals have gone extinct in the history of the earth?  
Did you know there's also 0 tyrannosauruses left?
This is being blown out of proportion. All we need to do is bring some southern white rhinos up north and let them adapt to the local culture.
Ignore OP's shitty title. There are roughly 17000 white rhinos left. No genetic differences between north and south. Still not a lot but dont let OP fool you 
How will my life change after the last one dies? Hint: it won't.
I don't think I've ever been this anxious for a rhino pregnancy in my whole life.
In the wild?

Nope.
These comments are pathetic. 
At this point, is it even worth trying to save the species? If everyone is so pro-evolution, why not let evolution run its course? 
This is so sad. Just for a horn..
I just hope we are saving the DNA from all the shit we are killing.  so the people in a few hundred years can undo some of our shittyness
I remember writing a page about them in 4th grade and they were how I learned about extinction and now every once in a while I hear the number drop
Move the southern ones up maybe?
Dibs
There's a fine line between extinction and murder 
The instant we stopped hunting/gathering we began fucking the earth from every orifice. This is one of the lessor of the consequences. More to come!
MAKE THEM FUCK !!
Sadness doesn't begin to describe what this makes me feel deep inside.
One of them still serves as a senator in AZ.
#whiterhinosmatter
Pretty pathetic that there hasn't been an effective effort to save them.
Thanks China and Vietnam. Thanks a lot.
Threesome!
Are there any non-northern white rhinos they can be cross bred with?
Is the Wikipedia page outdated then? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_rhinoceros
Tough going once the gene pool has been reduced that much. But with twelve they might have a chance, let's hope so.
What if we told poachers that if you let rhinos breed, you can have *more horns*

*edit: comma*
We should make them fight....... To the death... Jk I wish I had a rhino that'd be sweet 
Well shit. 

I was in San Diego Safari at the end of October and saw Nola - she wasn't table to breed anymore apparently, but it's a shame. A really nice day at the park, wonderful staff and a really great space.  Short trips out into the reserve on a bus, but a ton of great spaces to walk around, and a great cause. Would definitely recommend to others if you're in San Diego. 
...and one of them is gay. :V
They don't look very white to me.
Only 3 northern white rhinos left on Earth - 

Implying there are more on another planet?
White rhinos were formerly the most oppressive rhino race so this is actually a good thing.
This is sad news and likely the first of many. 
So, that rhino isn't white?

Is that some kind of reverse Rachel Dolezal shit going on there?
How do they know? What if there are more and we just don't know where they are. 
I'm not going to be emotionally crippled until Lions go extinct.  Fuck the hippo's, nobody gives a shit about them.
it's fine just grow more
All of these extinctions are just terrible. Humans should really start concentrating more on getting some tinctions going.
Ronald Reagan said it best, survival of those who are instrumental is fundamental, and those who arn't move on. Or in this case: go extinct.
I guess they weren't fit to live here.
Quick! Somebody encase one of them in amber!
&gt; on Earth

what the fuck other planet would they fucking be on? 
Too bad there's over 1,000,000 siege rhino's running around
They better get to fuckin!
I remember when I wrote a paper in school about 12 years ago about how these White Rhinos were endangered and only 600 remained. Sad to know nothing changed
Well, obviously they need to have an auction to sell a hunting permit  . . . you know, to raise money to save them.
This is really sad, but I am really bothered by the fact that they plan to restore the population of a species like that. It can't happen naturally so us mighty, righteous humans will fertilize more rhinos. About 200 species go extinct every day, but we gotta save this one because it was humans that brought it to this point. It just seems so pompous to me. Yes, poaching is an atrocious act, but that shouldn't mean we have to fulfill some moral obligation to save this species from extinction in an unnatural way. One day we will go too for one reason or another. The world keeps turning. Just don't think it's right.
No more great white buffalo either 
Four was also a small number.
If there are only 3 of them, there probably isn't enough genetic diversity for them to breed for more than a few generations. They are already extinct.
4 Including my ex. 
When these last three go. Which they will. Sales of Viagra may minutely improve.
So,  effectively extinct? 
Waiting to be shot by a dentist
and ppl still talmbout #blacklivesmatter smh
That guy that shot Cecil the lion better not be anywhere near those three.
I thought they went extinct years ago, now I found out there's actually 3 left! Good job guys!
Sometimes you just gotta come to terms with the fact that extinction isn't a purely humans-fucking-animals-over kind of deal; it's a natural fact of life. Some species die out. In fact, there's nothing more natural than one species dying out and another capitalizing on that fact. 
Everyone knows...only black rhinos matter...
see ya
Imagine how much those horns are worth
I suppose there are throngs of Asian men hoping for some body part off these 3 remaining animals to cure some alleged physical deficiency. What a sad world we live in.
THE GREAT FILTER

The truth is we will have to resort to cloning sooner or later. We can't combat every single poacher out there or stop habitat destruction or stop everyone from littering. Our period is honestly a sad period in human history.
If White Rhinos wanted to live they should have had better parents.  Tsk.
How many are left on Mars? 
With only 3 left I'd say "on the brink of extinction" is an understatement. 
I wouldn't fuck you if you were the last rhino on earth 
Ecological balance and all ..but male rhinos are asshole. They rape females to the point of death and kill their own cubs to assert dominance or some shit ..
Very sad. Hopefully they can make artificial insemination work. Or preserve sperm/eggs long enough to a time where we have the technology to make it work. GOOD LUCK!
Guess they meant to go extinct. We used to believe that. 
From Gawker:

&gt;Conservation officials recently announced a plan to bring this species back from the brink, using in vitro fertilization and surrogate Southern White Rhinos. The issue was collecting eggs from a female Northern White Rhino—there are two at the park in Kenya, and then there was Nola. With no known technique for harvesting eggs from living rhinos, the plan necessarily involved the death of a female, followed by quick action from whatever you call a person who harvests eggs from a dead rhino.

Hopefully, this plan will work.
But, how many Southern White Rhinos are left?
&lt;:(
Why do we only make cool animals go extinct?  Meanwhile fucking stink bugs are just chillin...
Wlep. We tried, guys. Only thing left to do now is put them in a cage somewhere and let them have a nasty rhino-threesome.
I'm not trying to be funny, is there a southern white rhino?  If so, what's the difference between the two?
Can we not just say that they were not "the fittest" and let it be?
It's ok, some shitty dentists will clean up the rest. 
There is probably nothing that can be done for this species. The concern is not these 3 rhinos, the concern is if this extinction, is do to our activity on this planet, then we should be careful in how we act.
Now the dentists know about them and will want to hunt them.
We get it, ok? They're going to die o ut. What can we do? I am sitting,  studying and browsing reddit and all I can do is feel bad. 

I'm frustrated on this morbid count down
Dude you can buy white rhino seeds all day online.
Finally, I can almost sleep easy at night.
We have 3 white rhinos here at the Indianapolis Zoo.....
Whose fault is this?
Humans...
What a misleading title for a very dark rhino
I'm not going to pretend I'm a big conservationist or anything like that but I know it is often asked "what makes humans different from animals." My answer has always been not only can humans identify problems like an animal going extinct, they also have the ability to try and solve those problems. With varying degrees of success, obviously. 
They need to just truck some southern white rhinos north. Problem solved. Next!
That's quite the omniscient statement, isn't it?
This is so sad. 
That's depressing
Only three Nurthen?
"Unproved" is far too generous a word to give to the medicinal purpose of rhino horn.
It is really sad to see people hunting rhinos in the world for their horns and leisure purposes, and the fact that I am Chinese makes me ashamed in my own culture how people are so naive into using expensive things as medicine. 
Guess White Rhinos won't be a thing for our next generation. Sorry on behalf of us, the Chinese.

There's only one of white me left. 
The hunt is on
Dibs on the horn of the last one. 
is this a different species from the southern white rhinos?

I'm sorry to be that guy, but could someone explain to me, why i should give a fuck?
Soooooo inbreeding will save this breed? So unfortunate. 
See ya, guys.
kill them and eat them and worry about other animals that are endangered. 
I think there is one close to mistys gym in the grass
They couldn't compete.

Good riddance.
Maybe they're just bad at surviving and we should let evolution do its thing.
hashtagEndExtinction. haha. dumb ass hippies. 
Poor fuckers, I always liked rhinos.
This is really a tragedy, it's truly a majestic animal and I'm sad to see them go, like so many others. 
Long Beach Rapper Vince Staples opinion on this.  FWIW, you should watch the entire video.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kgz1WGiXDc&amp;t=2m58s

Humanity sucks. 50 years ago there were thousands of these, and now there are 3. 
Sooo....extinct. =(
dibs
rip
I wonder how much a Northern White Rhino steak would cost? 
If I have to fuck a rhino to save them. So be it. Where do I send my sperm to? On that note, any tips on handling the envelope? Mine is soggy and tearing apart.
What planet did the rest go to?
Guess I better go save them.
racist fucking rhinos
It's happening so fast, many scientists believe that the definition of what makes a species distinct is hotly debated.
White lives matter! 
Guess that Runescape promotion didn't really help Owning a rhino horn doesn't actually make their donger bigger.
And apparently I can't see them because of your shitty ads
This just in:
&gt; Turkey’s news agency Dogan repeats reports that Turkmen commanders have stated that their forces shot both Russian pilots while they were parachuting down, and that they have the bodies.

Wait until Putin hears this.
Putin's statement:
&gt; "This event is beyond the normal framework of fighting against terrorism. Of course our military is doing heroic work against terrorism... But the loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way. Our aircraft was downed over the territory of Syria, using air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16. It fell on the Syrian territory 4km from Turkey."
&gt; 
&gt; "Neither our pilots nor our jet threatened the territory of Turkey. This is obvious. They are fighting terrorists in the northern areas around Latakia, where militants are located, mainly people who originated in Russia, and they were pursuing their direct duty, to make sure these people do not return to Russia. These are people who are clearly international terrorists."
&gt; 
&gt; "Taking into account that we signed an agreement on deconflicting with the US, and as we know Turkey was among the ones that has joined the US coalition. Since Isis has such huge resources of hundreds of millions and billions of dollars coming from illicit oil sales, and they are protected by the armed forces of other states, then it’s clear why they are so brazen, why they are killing people, why they are carrying out terrorist attacks throughout the world including in the heart of Europe."
&gt; 
&gt; "We will analyse everything, and today’s tragic event will have significant consequences, including for Russia-Turkish relations. We have always treated Turkey as a friendly state. I don’t know who was interested in what happened today, certainly not us. And instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours."


&gt; "Do they want to make Nato serve ISIS? I understand that every state has its own regional interests and we’ve always respected that, but we will never allow the kind of crime that happened to today to take place. And of course we hope that the international community will find the strength to come together and fight against the common evil."

Shit's gonna go down.



**Update**: More details from Putin's press conference:
&gt; "We have long been recording the movement of a large amount of oil and petroleum products to Turkey from Isis-occupied territories. This explains the significant funding the terrorists are receiving. Now they are stabbing us in the back by hitting our planes that are fighting terrorism. This is happening despite the agreement we have signed with our American partners to prevent air incidents, and, as you know, Turkey is among those who are supposed to be fighting terrorism within the American coalition."

&gt; "If Isis is making so much money – we are talking about tens or maybe even hundreds of millions, possibly billions of dollars – in oil trade and they are supported by the armed forces of an entire state, it is clear why they are being so daring and impudent, why they are killing people in such gruesome ways, why they are committing terrorist attacks all over the world, including in the heart of Europe."
NATO have called a meeting.

I bet the NATO guys are all sitting with their heads in their hands saying "oh for *fucksake*"
In Brussels, Nato officials say Russian jet entered Turkish airspace before it was shot down. Earlier the US said the Russian incursion into Turkish air space lasted just seconds. Nato ambassadors apparently believe
Turkey could have shown more restraint. This from Reuters.
Diplomats present at the meeting told Reuters that while none of the 28 Nato envoys defended Russia’s actions, many expressed concern that Turkey did not escort the Russian warplane out of its airspace. “There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,” said one diplomat who declined to be named.

Turkish official: 'Two Russian pilots still alive'

&gt;Despite earlier reports that the two pilots are dead, a Turkish official has told Reuters otherwise.

&gt;Turkey believes the two pilots from a Russian war plane it shot down close to the Syrian border on Tuesday are still alive and is working to secure their release from Syrian rebels, a Turkish government official told Reuters. “Our units, who received the information that the two pilots were alive, are working to get them from opposition rebels safely,” the official said.

I highly doubt someone will see this because everyone would rather read negative news.


EDIT: Those referring to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVJ7Q097gXM
I don't know whether its the same incident or not because video is obviously zoomed in on the pilots face without any prior context. So the only way to confirm would be from the Russian side since they'll know who their pilots in that jet were. 
Anyways, the people in the video are speaking Arabic.


-----------------------------------------
Obama: 'Turkey and Russia must talk and de-escalate'
&gt;On the downing of the Russian plane, Obama says it has the right to defend its territory and its airspace, and stresses the importance of Turkey and Russia working to de-escalate the situation. He says if Russia concentrates on Isis there would be fewer chances of mistakes. “The problem has been Russia’s focus on propping up Assad rather than concentrating on Isil.”

I guess this confirms it. That was one of the Pilots in the video:
&gt;Russian military: 'one of pilots is dead'
The Russians have contradicted Turkish claims that both Russian pilots are alive. The Russian military general staff says one of the men is dead, reports the RIA news agency.

-----------------------------------------
Video of a supposedly deputy commander of rebel Turkmen forces in Syria saying his men shot at two Russian pilots after they ejected from their jet. He also claims to show parts of a Russian military parachute. Both Russia and its ally, the Syrian government, have carried out strikes in the area where the plane came down.

Russia: Marine on rescue helicopter died

&gt;Russian journalists are being given a briefing by the defence ministry

&gt;These are the main lines so far as reported by RIA Novosti:

&gt;*One of the two pilots has died, from “fire from the ground”.*

&gt;*The fate of the second pilot remains unclear. A helicopter sent to rescue the pilots was hit, performed an emergency landing, and one of the marines on board died.*

&gt;*Military contacts with Turkey will be severed.*

&gt;*Russia says Syrian air traffic control shows the Turkish F-16 which shot down the Russian plane violated Syrian airspace.*

-----------------------------------------

More now from the Russian military, and about that new statement that a marine on a helicopter sent in to search for the crew of the downed jet also died.

&gt;Russia’s military general staff is quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that one of the pilots of the Su-24 warplane that was shot down by Turkey was killed by groundfire as he parachuted from his crippled plane.

&gt;General staff spokesman Lt. Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, added that rebels in Syria fired on a Russian helicopter that was searching for the two pilots of the Su-24.

&gt;The shooting killed one crew member on the Mi-8 helicopter and forced it to land in neutral territory, he says.

&gt;The rest of the crew was evacuated. Rudskoi also said that Russian radar data showed that Turkish warplanes had violated Syrian airspace in the course of shooting down the Russian plane

Edit: Did not expect my original comment to get as much attention. Reformatted it to reflect an update on key points in the live thread. I'll continue to update it as more events are confirmed.

[deleted]
Putin should implement a no fly zone above the territory occupied by the kurds.

This will teach a lesson to Erdogan.
Turkey is most likely funding ISIS by [buying up](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/turkey-buying-oil-isis-syrian-army-releases-photos-captured-tanker-656183) their cut-rate crude oil.
Stupid shit like this is why Turkey is not welcome in the EU.
This is such a fucked up situation... Russia is using the excuse of Isis to destroy the more moderate opponents of Assad who Turkey supports, Turkey is using the excuse of Isis to attempt to destroy the Kurds who the US supports in Iraq and Syria, but defines as a terrorist association in Turkey. Saudi Arabia is probably funding any anti-Shia militias, whilst Iran and Hezbollah are being drawn into the fighting against Sunni radicals. Meanwhile, members of Nato have been tacitly coordinating with Russian planes in raids against Isis, but now another member of Nato has shot down a Russian plane. Whilst refugees are fleeing from Isis atrocities, but now nobody wants to let them in because of fear of Isis. There are too many entangled interests in this clusterfuck of a war.

Edit: A reply for all those taking issue with my use of the word "moderates":

My point is that none of this is as black and white as most people on Reddit like to make out.....

Turkey labels their bombing of Kurds as a fight against "terrorists"... Russia labels their bombing of anti-Assad forces, such as these Turkmen groups, who AREN'T ISIS, as a fight against "terrorists". The US labels some groups as terrorists if they're in one country, but freedom fighters if they're in another country.

And there are so many grey areas that you can't argue that any country is in the right. Are drone assassinations of your own and other country's citizens, in a country that you're not officially at war, war crimes? Are the shooting down of parachuting Russian pilots a war crime? What if these pilots are bombing the hell out of you, because you are fighting against a state that has already barrel-bombed it own citizens, and probably used chemical weapons on its own people? Which are the greater crimes?

I can't think of any group or country involved in this conflict that can argue unambiguously that they have done or are doing the right thing, according to 20th century conventions of war. 



Even if Turkey's story is true and the Russian plane violated Turkish airspace, shooting it down seems an incredible overreaction.

It's becoming clearer by the day that Turkey is more than just an unreliable ally, she's not an ally at all. Just as things were starting to fall into place and common cause against Da'esh seemed possible, Turkey has thrown a Molotov cocktail onto the negotiating table - and I don't think this is in any way coincidental.

I really hate Putin but he is right on the money with this. Turkey has been attempting to play both sides for much too long.
"says Syrian Observatory for Human Rights" 

its funny the spokesperson of the "moderate rebels" still uses this name after their "moderate rebels" would kill russian prisoners of war.

so much for those "human rights loving "moderate rebels"
This just in: persecuted, Russian-speaking minorities discovered in Turkey
Step by step the world is getting to know what Erdoğan's government is like. If you think this is something, you have only seen the tip of the iceberg.
I think the real question here is not about whether Turkey had the "rights" of shooting the plane or not, the real question is whether it was worth it and if it's so why it was worth it... 
Turkey is a strange, strange bird.  I mean, on one side, they are one of the principle purchasers of ISIS oil and known to be igniting a lot of these conflagrations.  But on the other side, they are a NATO power who have been bargaining for years for admittance into the EU.  How are they Satan and the angel at the same time?
Putin sure is fancy. He had two overlapping English translators there, just in case we didn't get the message.

Then again the male translator was probably dubbing things over for the Guardian, whereas the woman sounded like she was right there in the room with Putin.

Stabbed in the back...I can't wait to hear how Erdogan responds to that!
finally someone says it. its not the turkish people though, its the absolutely corrupt and harmful government.

also i want to add, while it seems that putin does have a good intention and pursue relatively clean goals, i think we should take verything he (OR ALL POLITICIANS) says with a grains of salt. never forget that.
Turkey did oil trade with ISIS, and now, when Russia initiated blowing up oil trucklines, they got really pissed. Any sanctions on ISIS partners? 
There's overwhelming evidence, eye witness and physical accounts that Turkey has helped Daesh in the past,  it's probable that they still are. Turkey is also terrorizing the Kurdish town of Sival, killing civilians and destroying local areas.

Erdogan is a fucking scum bag. Hope he takes on the back draft face first. 
Apart from this incident, to all those comments saying "Destroy Turkey!!1!" and all the hate towards us Turks, take a chill pill. %50 of Turks didn't vote for Erdogan government and believe me, we hate him and all this shit he brought with him WAY more than you do. 
Isis is transporting oil right on their border and they do nothing while a plane just touches on their border and they shoot it down including the pilots parachuting to safety. Fuck you Turkey!

Well he is not wrong.
Turkey shot down the fighter/bomber, okay fine, but then the brilliant minds on the ground decided to shoot the pilots? Who are these buffoons running around over there?   
Turkey shooting down that Russian plane is akin to fat women wearing spandex.

Just because you can doesnt mean you should. Use discretion.
Everyday the news makes playing Fallout 4 less and less fun..

Its no secret that Turkey has been funding ISIS and sheltering their fighters within its borders. Why the hell are we still allowing them to be in NATO???

Turkey and Saudi Arabia are two countries that should be in the axis of evil. 
You can follow a livestream here!  in two minutes there will be a statement by the nato secretary general.  http://www.nato.int/
So... to confirm: The U.S. and Russians don't like each other, especially after the Crimean Crisis.  But, Russia and the U.S. both hate Daesh.  However the U.S. kinda sorta hates Syria's Al-Assad regime, but Russia supports Al-Assad.  

The U.S. is friendly with Turkey since they are one of their few allies in the region.  But now, Russia hates Turkey.  And Turkey supports Daesh via the oil trade.

21st Century geopolitics is fucked.  To all of the armchair politicians in /r/WorldNews: If you're so fucking smart, tell me how you'd resolve this.
&gt;"Mr Erdogan spoke of Turkey's "rage" at the decision to shoot down the F-4 Phantom on 22 June and described Syria as a "clear and present threat".  

&gt;"A short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack," he said. The Turkish jet was on a training flight, testing Turkey's radars in the eastern Mediterranean, he said.

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-18584872

Guess that only applies to them.
what scares me most is that Turkey just elected a fascist, nationalist, conservative party... that's like the preparation for every war -  to rally your civillians behind the government to support their actions
Turkey is secretly supporting ISIS.
It's gonna be a cold winter in Turkey as they get 57% of there natural gas from Russia.
Looking at a map of what happened, the Russian jet passed through a small section of Turkey that randomly juts out from the rest of the Turkish border. Then it was shot, and subsequently crashed, outside of Turkish airspace. It had already left Turkish airspace when it was shot down. I think this was just an excuse for turkey to flex its muscles, albeit a very poor choice/timing to do so
I'm Turkish and this reddit post is full of offensive talks against humanity. If that was a mistake done by Turkish government they should take the blame and apologise. I feel bad about Russian pilots too which was innocent and killed by diplomacy. Nevertheless as a Turkish guy, i don't deserve to be called terrorist or genocider. We're trying so hard to keep this country democratic and secular so don't do othering on us. Help us to be more secular, help us to be more democratic, don't push us out of West. Half of the Turkish population in Republic of Turkey hates current government. Acknowledge that, believe us. This government doesn't represent all of us.

I'm sorry about my English, after all it's not my native language.
It is not crazy to think that Russia violated Turkish airspace. They have done it many times before and refuse to respond when called. That being said Turkey's actions are understandable, protecting your sovereign state and all that, but still Turkey. Come on, shoot the jet down was not necessary. 
He's not wrong on this one. Turkey is already helping ISIS quite a bit. Just wait till Mutti Merkel says  "Yes, erdogan, come in the EU".
The Middle East is like a MC Escher painting with guns. 

Without careful attention to detail it's probably possible for a major power declare war on itself out of sheer confusion.
the Middle East reminds me of the movie Chinatown.
Is Turkey NATO? Please dont be NATO.
http://video.foxnews.com/v/4630118119001/

Might be fox news but this video provided some good input.
I'm really confused about all this one sided and unreflected comments here. Everything Putin says gets praised in this subreddit and now it's "fuck turkey", "turkey has no democracy", "turkey supports terrorist"?  
  
I'll probably get downvoted to oblivion for this but Putin literally invaded the Ukraine, which led to the situation that a passenger airplane got shut down and supports Assad, a dictator and mass murderer. And don't tell me anything about the "democracy" in russia.  
This "good guy" Putin attitude is perverse.  
EDIT: Saying that Turkey's automatically right then, was the opposite I wanted to say.

I get the feeling Russia is gonna be killing the most Turkey during Thanksgiving this year
I'm Turkish and as you probably know we have no say in what the government was/is doing with ISIS or events like these. If ever Turkey becomes a target, it's the government and not the people. Sorry, that's common sense.. right?
"Alex I'll take what used to be Turkey for $1000." 
SU flys over 500km/h .. according to turkish radar it took 3km shortcut over turkey.. so it was there 36s . So how they warned this jet 10 times in 5 minutes?????
[Pentagon backs Turkey’s version of events, blames ‘incursion’ of Russian jet](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/24/pentagon-backs-turkeys-version-accuses-russian-fig/)

Of course they do.
Completely irresponsible of Turkey. Turkey have been acting  deceitfully for a while now and in my opinion don't deserve to be in NATO. 
He isn't wrong, Turkey has helped ISIS a LOT since they started, they should be treated as an ally of ISIS and punished accordingly 
I'm sure this will end well.
Well, he's not wrong. They've been al-Nusra's number one supporters.
I feel for the pilots, however this seems clear and cut.

*  Turkey has communicated with Russia that their airspace is not to be used by Russian jets for weeks.
*  Turkey has over the past few weeks warned multiple incursions that they will be shot down if they enter their airspace with military vehicles,  without shooting.
*  Turkey warned this jet before and while they over flew their airspace and the Jet looped back over and did so a second time with no response and was shot down.

It is not about ISIS or terrorists,  it is about Russia disregarding countries boarders with wartime military airspace violations -- Turkey would have been within their rights to shoot down without any warnings in this case;  let alone multiple same flight warnings.

Turkey is well within their rights to shoot down the armed military jet from a country that was specifically warned they do not have permission to fly in their airspace and any such incursion would be considered hostile.  Their only other choice was to allow an armed military jet from a country they do not trust and which is dropping bombs on populations unrelated to ISIS and allied against the Syrian president to use their airspace as at minimum an asset or in the worst case as a target.
Fuck Erdogan
Russia has denounced Turkey! Warning the world they are not to be trusted. 
The DLC for Fallout 4 is going to be great! The graphics are going to look so much better! 
Obama pardons Turkey every year at this time. This year is no different.
Wow that's almost as bad as shooting down a civilian aircraft with Russian Buk missiles. 
Erdogan is a thief and a murderer.
Man I love how he doesn't beat around the bush like most heads of state would
That would be a fair assessment
https://youtu.be/IschF-ihjS0 shot down helicopter video
The distance the russian jet flew over turkish ground according to [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUkdnCuW4AAxX9L.png:large) image is about [2.5km](http://i.imgur.com/KN26AjJ.jpg).
According to the news in Turkey, 2 pilots are apparently alive and Turkey is trying to take them back. Sigh at least get them safe so that Russia will be less pissed...
Starting a war with Russia right before winter. I see someone hasn't learned anything from the last century.
I can just imagine this being taught decades from now, the same way we teach the cold war today.

"And, in a tactical move to end negotiations for a better common cause against ISIS, Turkey shot down a Russian plane to throw it into chaos."

Seen that theory thrown around a bit, and it honestly makes the most sense. Turkey is enjoying oil at pennies right now, they're not about to let some smooth negotiations go ahead that stop that. Shooting down a Russian plane that entered their airspace for 2 seconds (which means they had guns trained on it before it had even entered their airspace) fucks it all up.
I can't wait for literally nothing to come of this. Everyone is too fucking spineless.
In a way he's not wrong...I mean they decided to attack the Turkish branch of the Peshmerga/PKK who were directly fighting ISIS....sooo.....he's not wrong
There must be few million russian whores in turkey. There are russian prostitutes on every fucking block in istanbul. The turkish authorities better keep an eye on them. No telling what they will do if they turn nationalistic...
Well he is not wrong is he?
To get a 'picture' of what happened. Directly from the Turkish Defense ministry (via the BBC)

This is starting to feel a lot like the beginning of World War One with all of the changing alliances and interests.
they say this guy shot down the russian jet

A second aircraft has been downed;

*One of the two pilots has died, from “fire from the ground”.
The fate of the second pilot remains unclear. A helicopter sent to rescue the pilots was hit, performed an emergency landing, and one of the marines on board died.*
DirecTV just did an EAS test while they were talking about the incident on the news. Scared the shit out of me.
Tape played at NATO meeting showed Turkey warned Russian jet 21 times in 5 minutes before shooting it down, NATO official tells Channel 4.
Russians fly over Canadian airspace all the time and we've never shot one down, this seems like a terrible overreaction.

source* I'm Canadian 
Last time the Turks fucked with a guy named Vlad didn't some wierd shit happen?
So Russia is going after Turkey, Syria, Georgia, Ukraine...   This is not about terrorism it is about controlling the supply of middle East oil to Europe.   Just look at a map.
They knew they were russian right?  I mean they didn't think ISIS got some planes and was flying around right?
Do you see where this is headed, guys?

East vs West.

The Cold War never ended, why should it? It was a  great way to shift wealth and power.
But these are Obama backed rebels so it is okay that they shot one of the pilots parachuting down.
I feel like every day I'm reading the events that will end up leading to the next world War. 
Mistaken the thread title as an onion article with thanksgiving coming up.
Moscow are deploying several James Bondskis to Turkey as you read this
Good thing Putin and Edrogan are widely regarded as level-headed leaders who always act in their people's best interest.
this whole good vs evil shit America and other countries tries to spin is bullshit. Now who is on the wrong side of the equation? 
I wonder if the descent into WW2 felt like this.
Russia has denounced Turkey
If the shoe fits....Regardless of how I feel about Putin and his policies, when the man is right, he's right. 
Just how the Cold War shaped the geopolitical landscape of the world for the following decades, the resolution of this ISIS/Syria conflict will shape the alliances and state relationships of the next 30-50 years. It's going to be interesting to see how NATO deals with this type of pressure. France has been flying side by side with Russia since the attacks, while Turkey cant seem to reconcile its domestic obligations with its international ones. The EU is being tested as well with the refugee problem. It would be interesting to see if this conflict can actually destabilize the big 2 Western institutions.

Times like these i remember that old Chinese proverb (or curse) "may you live in interesting times".

Anyone know the names of the pilots, or of the person (people) who shot them as they parachuted out? 

Call me crazy, but considering how volatile the world seems to be currently, I'm worried these names will be as significant as Gavrilo Princip and Franz Ferdinand. 
In a parallel responsible world: US kicks turkey out of NATO, applies economic sanctions on Turkey and other Sunni islamic countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar for supporting islamic terrorism.
They are.
Here is the [video footage](http://vestimir.ru/load/novosti/novosti_rossii/v_socsetjakh_rasprostranjajutsja_videokadry_na_kotorykh_boeviki_umerennoj_sirijskoj_oppozicii_s_krikami_allakh_akbar_radostno_snimajut_pogibsheg/203-1-0-9228) of happy shits, filming dead Russian pilot.
That shit is just disgusting

they are accomplices of ISIS.. they are funding them because they hate the kurds
Imagine if this was the other way around, Russia has just shot down a NATO jet in Western Ukraine, it would be sanctions on Russia, break off of all negotiations, kick them out of UN Security Council, 'Putin is Hitler the 2nd' propaganda...whereas when it happens to Russia they are completely cool about it.

Of course, Turkey has been supporting those who Russia are fighting, they were even found to be sending weapons to ISIS inside UN food trucks, the journalist who exposed received death threats, then was murdered no long after. Turkey are lying about Russia being over their border, they want Russia out of this, as they know that Russia will protect Turkey's target...Assad.

ALLEGED VIDEO FOOTAGE OF MILITIA MEN FIRING ON RUSSIAN PILOTS:

https://twitter.com/Conflicts/status/669166140766199808
 Putin’s number one goal, we must remember, is to break NATO—or at minimum to show that it is a paper tiger.
So apparently Russia is in the wrong for bombing "moderate" Islamic rebels. So what makes a "moderate" Islamic rebel different from an ISIS fighter? They both shout Allah Akbar, they both kill and torture their POWs, they both rape and kill civilians. So.....
He's not wrong that they are 'accomplices of terrorists.' It's been known that Turkey has been arming and financially supporting ISIS. In fact, it's not even that covert as reporters in Turkey have vanished for reporting this.
This is Russia and Turkey's fault, both have acted irresponsibly.  Russia has be trying to bully NATO states with flyovers, close calls, flying military aircraft in commercial airline routes at high speed with transponders off and violating coastal waters for a few years now.  Their chickens have finally come home to roost.

Turkey is in bed with various unsavory "rebel" groups in Syria and clearly objects to their being bombed by Russia.  I believe the Russians did violate Turkish airspace as depicted by the radar track [here](https://twitter.com/CNNTURK_ENG/status/669098577524822016/photo/1).  

Bad news all the way around. 
Turkey has done nothing to fight ISIS really, but they did start a campaign against the Kurds. So...
Turkey needs to be kicked out of NATO immediately for their support of Isis and al Qaeda.
Apparently a video of the Helicopter landing and getting hit by a TOW.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IschF-ihjS0&amp;feature=youtu.be
Because they are. They've allowed safe passage for ISIS into Syria, the people obviously condone the Paris attacks by shouting God is great or some shit at the recent Greece soccer match during a moment of silence. Fuck Turkey. I hope Russia drops the hammer on their military and capitol.
Why the hell is Obama defending Turkey? I'd rather be on Russia's side than Turkey.
Everyone that wishes for a swift retaliation is a total idiot. We need calm and rational heads now, otherwise we are helping groups like Daesh to acomplish their goals. They wish for a global war.
I saw the video where they take out the fucking chopper.

they just begun starting WW3, for fucks sake:

All you have to do is stop constantly sending your aircraft in other's airspace and this can't happen. http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/russian-bombers-intercepted-near-canadian-airspace-1.2015670
Keep in mind that as far as Syria is concerned, Putin is basically just a regime thug. He doesn't care about fighting Daesh he cares about propping up Assad.

I'm not saying that Turkey was right to do this- I get the impression this was probably more about cheap illegal Syrian oil from their part.

I think people need to remember that basically everyone involved is an asshole- I hear people standing behind Putin on this, but he's not a guy to stand behind.

Holy shit, Syria, what a fucking mess. What an awful fucking mess.
&gt;The Turkish UN ambassador, Halit Cevik, told the UN Security Council in a letter that [two planes had flow a mile into Turkey for 17 seconds](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/24/turkey-shoots-down-jet-near-border-with-syria). “Following the violation, plane 1 left Turkish national airspace. Plane 2 was fired at while in Turkish national airspace by Turkish F-16s performing air combat patrolling in the area,” he wrote.
How have we in the US not realized yet that Turkey is a pretty shitty "ally"?

If we get into slugging match with Russia, that is one thing... but not over Turkey.
Russia's been bombing the fuck out of FSA and telling the world they were bombing ISIS and Reddit has been believing every word of it.
To worsen things: the jet was shot down over Syria and the terrorists murdered the two pilots while they parachuted. If Turkey wanted to give Russia all the moral high ground they could, they've done a superb job.
Thats exactly what they are. Fuck Turkey
There are rules and Russia violated them, several times. Not only this but the jet was on its way to launch attacks against Turkmen an act that is both provocatory and egregious towards Turkey. 

Turkey may not be a great ally in this battle against ISIS, but lets be real here. See Russian actions for what they really are.
What do you expect from a country where tens of thousand of their citizens boo during a minutes silence for victims of ISIS.
I don't think Turkey is really our friend. I don't think we should stick with them on this. That wasn't okay. 
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/world/europe/russian-violations-of-airspace-seen-as-unwelcome-test-by-the-west.html?_r=0

Here is an article from Oct. about Russians violating Turkish air space.
See this: https://youtu.be/3f5-TM-67Gg

Turkey has been arming IS the whole time!
This video shows IS terrorists enjoying Turkish transportation while training there and selling oil.
well techincaly so is the US and Canada and France who are all supporting these morons in the name of booting Assad. These guys who shoot down jets and hold the pilots hostage, these are the good guys supposedly. 
Oh so how long ago was it that [Russian missiles shot down a civilian airliner?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) And what of the Russian tendency to turn off [aircraft transponders?](http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/medialibrary/2015/03/11/4264a5a6/ELN%20Russia%20-%20West%20Full%20List%20of%20Incidents.pdf)
Why the Russian military is not good with maps?! They frequently step in to other countries by 'mistake'.
I just dont understand why the Turks did this? It makes no sense whatsoever. Its blatantly obvious that Russia was no threat to them, and its blatantly obvious that Russia was there to bomb ISIS, or atleast that was there route. What the hell did they think they would achieve by this? Its a freaking act of war!
ill just leave this here

[http://imgur.com/5XjTE6C](http://imgur.com/5XjTE6C)
Can we all step back from pumping Putin's cock and remember when Russia shot down an actual civilian airliner over Eastern Ukraine?  
Of course it's a tragic event what happened today. Yet the situation is too complex to say so easy "fuck Turkey, kick them out". Every action/operation conducted in the Middle East affects Turkey directly. The first Gulf war left Turkey with hundred thousands refugees to feed. Not only that, trade for the region collapsed. Than the second Gulf war leaving a crippled Iraq behind, without functional institutions. An Iraqi army which ran away when they saw the black flag of ISIL. Now they are running around with weapons from these western countries. Resulting in an additional 2 million refugees to feed. And ISIL with all the Toyotas, they didn't buy them from a reseller, they were left behind irresponsibly from US, Britain and the fucking Nato. Some of the weapons have already arrived in the hands of PKK. Now who is feeding whose terrorist? Does any one of you remember Turkey leaving back an arsenal of weapons to terrorists in your countries? I know that Greece has PKK training camps on its soil and Cyprus as well. I know that Belgium lets Fahriye Erdal run around freely instead of delivering her. So who should get kicked out? 
Jesus christ, a majority of people on here have no idea what they are talking about. A lot of you are impressed just because Putin said he's going to bomb ISIS, yet he's done very little against ISIS and is instead doing bombing runs against American backed rebels that are fighting Assad. And on what planet is violating air space not a legitimate reason to shoot down a military jet? They were warned 10x for a full 5 minutes, but because Putin said a bunch of tough words about ISIS you all lap it up.
Not to let Turkey off the hook or anything. They're dumb as fuck for doing this, and Putin's characterization of them as "accomplices of terrorists" has been spot on for this entire war. 

But what are the chances that Russia deliberately sent that plane over their border, hoping something like this would happen?
I love how the Pilots left 10 warnings within 5 minutes by the Turkish Military ignored (unanswered) and then you wonder why they were shot down? What do you think would happen if you just enter airspace that's not yours? What would the US military do? What would the russians do? Exactly...
Looks like Russia is actually doing something against ISIS. Even Turkey is worried.
ITT: A bunch of international law experts.
I find the biggest fuck up here is not Turkey downing the Russian jet, but the war crime of the pilot execution and the filming of the attack on the CSAR party afterwards. 
That will have the Russian public baying for blood. 
He ain't wrong...

And he ain't exactly one to talk.
Is Putin gonna get mad when Obama pardons the turkey?
Do you guys really think Turkey and Saudi Arabia support these terrorist without US' approval?

first time a Nato country has shot down a Russian Plane.
Erdogan protecting his Jihadi buddies again.
I wonder if Syria was to shoot down American jets would people then say its ok because a nation has the right to defend its airspace? 
Putin calls Turkey 'accomplices of terrorists' after Russian jet shot down...and Putin is 100% correct. Turkey is helping ISIS and just two days ago warned Russia to STOP BOMBING ISIS targets in Syria. Isn't it clear to you all yet that we've been lied to? Obama and Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar have been funding and protecting ISIS all along because they use ISIS as their little proxy army to kill the Kurds and get rid of Assad. 

You have been lied to! 
I've said it countless times now. Turkey hasn't been a secular democracy worthy of NATO membership for a long time now. We should have never agreed to turn our backs on the Kurds.

Kick Turkey to the curb and give the Kurds an independent and recognized Kurdistan in exchange for being the boots on the ground against ISIS.
Goddamn it Turkey, world wars have started over shit like this.
Fighting words for a man who invaded Crimea unprovoked, whose forces shot down a civilian airliner, and attacks cities in Syria with no regard of civilian casualties. 

The only way to avoid these sorts of happenings is if Russia stops violating Turkish airspace. 
Turkish narrative is no match against the Russian narrative. Prepare to lose the propaganda war. 
russia sure is great at crossing borders it's not allowed to...
The CIA-supported group said it shot at both Russian crewmen while they were landing in their parachutes, a clear violation of the Geneva Conventions' rules on warfare.

Hey who remembers when russian rebels down a COMMERCIAL plane? 
Putin and Russia seem to be the only sane person/nation in this shitshow.
[deleted]
The search-and-rescue chopper that was attempting to rescue the pilots is now confirmed to have been destroyed by a US-supplied TOW missile, given to what the state department are still defending as "moderates." http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/621677/Reports-Russian-helicopter-shot-down-while-searching-downed-jets

$100,000 US-taxpayer funded TOWs being used to kill heroic Russian aircrews.

What the fuck. I am sorry, Russia.
* Turkey commits genocide against the Armenians.
* Turkey murders Kurds.
* Turkey supplies ISIS with weapons.
* Turkey purchases ISIS oil.
* Turkey downs a Russian fighter, risking WWIII.

Time to eject Turkey from NATO, they truly have no place amongst the civilised nations of the earth.
[The Turkish radar shows the plane was clearly shot down inside Syria after it flew above a tiny blip of Turkish territory.](https://twitter.com/Conflicts/status/669098897181122560)

Also why is Turkey calling on NATO here when they were the ones who fucked up? They support ISIS, let the terrorists through to Europe and then when they fuck up they run behind NATO? What a bunch of pussies.  Kick them out and let them have it with Russia alone. 
Anyone know if the pilot ejected or was he killed when the missile hit? 
but, but "Turkey said its fighter jets have shot down a warplane after it violated Turkey’s airspace. The jet was warned 10 times in the space of five minutes over airspace, the Turkish military said in a statement."
Isn't ISIS getting their weapons smuggled through Turkey?

I have read several articles on it. [Here](https://www.rt.com/news/259409-turkish-weapons-syria-terrorists/) is one.

Also, they (Turkey) wanted to join EU so bad, I suppose that plan is hopefully impossible now
The Syrian Rebels are allied with the nato forces fighting against Assad and Russia,  the Russians are allied with the Syrian military and Assad and are fighting Syrian Rebels and Nato,  both groups are fighting Isis, when not fighting each other.

3 factions, enemy of my enemy type conflict.

Isis controls most of Syria and Iraq,  except the majority of the oil fields, Exxon and Shell control those.

Well, that's what's being reported.
Just saying what no one wants to say
Fallout 5 confirmed!!! Setting: Turkey
So Putin and Erdogan walk into a bar. Sorry, a war.
Hooooly shit. I was waiting for the day someone poked the bear hoping it didn't happen. Looks like that day may have come. Front page of CNN now shit's going to blow up, literally and metaphorically. Let's all hope this doesn't snowball. Why did they poke the bear...no one but them wants this. 
Well wasn't Turkey found to have been giving ISIS electricity?
He's right on the money
This is the first time that a NATO country shot down a Russian jet since the Cold War!
Turkey is secretly plotting to ruin Thanksgiving as retribution for all the Turkey jokes. 
and there goes Thanksgiving, thanks a lot, Putin.
This is the basic gist of the situation;

Russian jet was doing circular rounds over Syria. It, however, crossed into Turkish air space for a certain duration. Turkish forces did not recognize the jet and it was not a NATO plane. They tried to communicate with it, did not receive response. I believe on the second entry into Turkish airspace, the plane was shot down. 

Think of that what you will, but what was unquestionably wrong was the shooting of the parachuting pilots. 
Its gonna be really poetic if the Cold War stars again when its actually winter... Fuuuuuck.
Turkey would pick Thanksgiving to make its move, wouldn't they. 
Things just keep looking up for Asaad. 
I can't believe he would say something like that about  thanksgiving.
[deleted]
Let it begin.
[You done fucked up now!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WSe9ugpXIw)
You know what? Erdogan and his government have been authoritarian as hell so if he was displaced I wouldn't mind, though I'm sure he'll do his best to cling to power like so many other dictators.
Why is CNN reporting that the fates of pilots is unknown.   Somewhere in this thread i saw turkish military confirm the deaths of pilots.    Why is CNN not reporting !!!
Russia gains Insult Casus Belli, Greece receives claim on Constantinople and Edirne.
Crazy coincidence that all of Crimea loses power and a couple days later this happens... /removes tinfoil hat. 
This is how world wars start. Hang on to your hats, folks.
IT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING!!! ronpaul.gif
When I heard this story all I could think about was some guy yelling at Putin: "RASH B! RASH B!"
Well technically they have a history of aiding isis and other terrorist groups.

On the other hand russia has a history of bullshit and ignoring borders...
Both are using isis as an excuse to fight someone else..

I doubt we'll ever know the truth, but shit ain't it fun to watch.
They are.

For that matter, most of the west is too.

Who isn't an accomplice of terrorists these days, i mean really?
When USA starts drafting people into the military, it better be men AND women. Equality!
Something is going to happen a few weeks from now and the same people that are like, "fuck Turkey", will be all "fuck Russia, poor Turkey."
That's absolutely true, but it has more to do with how Turkey is directly supporting ISIS while bombing the Kurds fighting ISIS than with shooting down that plane.
And so it begins... Insults that lead to more wars... 
here are Turkey's terrorist accomplices and friends of the FSA [nsfw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZM5MpSeLDg)  
Man, the last few top threads were really convenient eh.
Which they are because they are buying oil from ISIS.
I have a connecting flight through Turkey in a few weeks. Should I be worried?
Putin and Erdogan are two sides of the same coin. Both play on nationalism to promote themselves, both are PR queens that sustain their rating on events such as Syrian bombing. The downing of this plane is just a PR stunt, designed to create drama and steer away from the real problems both countries face. The sad part is, people will gulp down the drama and will be ready for the next portion whenever the Presidents will decide to release it. The truly sad part is the death of a pilot, an innocent victom of PR drama queens.
WTF is my country doing oh my god......
&gt;IS fighters said they carried out the gun and bomb massacre - calling Paris "the capital of prostitution and obscenity".

I like how prostitution is such a terrible idea for IS, but raping slaves is a-OK!
&gt; He said they were not carpet-bombing raids, but precision-guided operations that had been well planned in advance.

This gives some context. May be the attacks just expedited the raid.
Ugh. A google image search for Raqqa is NSFL.
France had a nap THEN FIRED THE MISSILES.
Shit is getting real pretty fast.
20 bombs, and a small scrap of paper that says "you know these things work even when they aren't strapped to your own men, right?".
Official video of French jets taking off to bomb Raqqa 

https://youtu.be/c4HuUjMUcQs

Edit : it appears the video has been blocked weirdly enough. 
Looking for another source 

Edit 2: updated the link as the video had been taken down from YouTube for some reason.  You can watch the video now on the french army's official military operation Facebook page 

Edit 3 : YouTube video is back online, I put back the YouTube video for better convenience 
I REALLY hope Russia get's wholeheartedly involved in obliterating ISIS. Putin has been looking for a fight with someone, and I really think he'd be great at killing jihadists on a large scale. And he isn't handcuffed by what other people think of his tactics. It could be awesome.
I just finished reading The Count of Monte Cristo. I learned the French can be savagely  revengeful.
France has been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS since September. 

https://www.rt.com/news/316624-france-bombs-isis-first/
[My friend sent me this yesterday.](http://imgur.com/kBrwdN7)
France has already been bombing ISIS in Iraq and Syria. I guess this will give people some war boner satisfaction but I'm not at all satisfied. These are attacks that would have been carried out anyways. More has to be done.

All the comments in here are acting like France hasn't been doing this for months already. Haven't they flown like over 1,000 missions so far?
&gt; The planes hit a jihadi recruitment centre, training camp and arms depot run by the group, according to the French defence ministry

My only question is why is this place being hit now, not yesterday or last week. 



But with that said, I'll just quote SaintViolet, "fuck their shit up hard"
This is one of those moments in life where words and descriptions will never fully articulate the scale of what has actually occurred. For many people, seeing a child's body washed up on the beach was the perspective they needed, but didn't want. That was plastered everywhere, and it hurt, therefore it was effective in serving it's purpose.

This said, I'm providing a link at the bottom. It's a photograph of the aftermath inside the Bataclan Concert Hall. I'm sure others have posted it, and it will probably make it's rounds at some point soon- but I haven't seen this picture anywhere else on Reddit aside from when I first saw it. The major subreddits where you would expect to find a disturbing image such as this have all been quick to remove it for their own various reasons, which is unfortunate, but ultimately their individual perogative.

&amp;nbsp;

I think it's important that people have the opportunity to see this.

&amp;nbsp;

This is not the most graphic picture I've ever seen by any stretch. Granted, I've seen some shit... but with this one, it's not so much about what's in the details (it's nothing "up close"). It's more about the visceral impact that the picture delivers, and not just within the context of the 13,^^th  but also when factoring together the events of the past few years.


Speaking for myself, the truth helps put the gravity of these events into a more accurate context, and I think it's important for everybody who shares this sentiment to be able to do so.

&amp;nbsp;

It's not for everybody.

&amp;nbsp;

Some people feel more comfortable with a sanitized version of reality- *there's no shame in that.*


I think most people agree you would get a better understanding of war from watching "*Saving Private Ryan*" than you would from watching "*Gomer Pyle*". This is the best analogy I can think of at the moment to draw comparisons between this picture and what you might see on CNN/BBC/NBC/etc.


Anyways, I'm done with my excessive diatribe. I just wanted to preemptively clarify my logic to those who will undoubtedly ask *"Why share this?"* and label my motives as *"tasteless"*.

Again, **I think everyone should see this, unless they explicitly choose not to**.

&amp;nbsp;

*Here it is...*

If the superpowers continue this trend, ISIS will become WASWAS.
Sometimes there is no right answer. 
It seems like half of reddit just wants the west to be a fucking punching bag. The other half wants to just indiscriminately blow shit up. 

Turns out that bombs don't bring peace. Turns out that doing nothing doesn't bring peace either. Europe as a whole has not effectively integrated their immigrant populations. And  western intervention hasn't improved the region any since WWII.

Japan post WWII is not relevant, the Japanese don't fight each other on their island.

I think the only way for peace in the middle east is either complete withdrawal and ostracizing of the region by the rest of the world, or a complete restructuring of the region by the UN, with real and instant consequences for states that sponsor terror.

If the world wants peace it needs to understand that its not free, its not permanent, and it sure as shit isn't clean.
I didn't expect this to happen so quickly but with that said, I'm not all that surprised either. 
French here.

Hate brings more hate. Bombs bring more bombs.

Still, I can't help but feel a bit satisfied by the news that these motherfuckers get rekt by our bombs.

You fucking fuckers.

EDIT: a lot of people here seem bloodthirsty, I expected something else.
https://twitter.com/Raqqa_SL/status/666001507163205637

No civilians casualties known so far, according to a local anti-ISIS network. I find it a bit hard to believe honestly.
Part of me wants to whine and cry how bombings aren't going to solve anything... 

..  but on the inside I'm rooting them the fuck on.   and I don't feel bad about it at all.  Bonne chance,  mes amis.
The problem is - now ISIS will show videos of innocent civilians dying in the aftermath as evidence of how the "crusaders" are killing innocent "brothers and sisters" and use such propaganda to recruit more Muslims to join their cause, thus, contributing to a vicious cycle. 

But to be blunt, if I was France, I would react in the same way and expect my government to react in the same way. 
Well ISIS pretty much fucked up the chances of innocent Syrians being welcomed in any country.
Some of you need to be honest with yourselves. The western world is the most measured, humane group of nations ever in history. France has nuclear bombs. Think about the kind of devastation they could unleash if they were actually cruel people like their opponents.
&gt; "The scale of these French airstrikes should not be seen as a wanton act of revenge, but really the French basically saying to their allies, 'we want to do all of the airstrikes' over the next period of time - however long that may be."


Yes, just the beginning. French voters now want blood. Just like American wanted blood after 9/11. Anyone's blood, does not matter. Someone has to pay. So they will hammer Syria and kill scores of poor SOBs that were unable to escape ISIS and were stuck there. And from the rubble, the pain and grief of the survivors, new terrorists will emerge. 


Edit: People are asking me what I propose instead. Here, this was written by Harry Browne in the aftermath of 9/11, but 12 years later,  it is still highly relevant. This is my proposal.    
[What Can We Do About Terrorism?](http://archive.lewrockwell.com/browne/browne63.html)

EDIT2: Wow, did not expect the gold. I just wrote this in the heat of the moment. Thank you sir/madam.
We can drop bombs on Raqqa for the next year, but it doesn't address the fundamental problem. Ultimately, all the money that enables Islamic fundamentalism comes from oil. If we really want to stop Islamic terrorism, we need to starve the beast: diminish Saudi's oil revenue. We should transition our economies away from oil. Without the revenue that comes from oil, Saudis and their ilk will not have the resources to export violence and hate. 
ISIS honestly isn't aware how badly the the French are about to fuck their shit up. The world pokes fun at the French for being pansies but, in reality, the French are notorious for whole sale rampaging without remorse. No questions asked. Kill if it moves and don't look back. That's what's about to start going down. I'm excited to watch another nation start to brutally kick off into ISIS's ass, but I am not looking forward to watching the innocent folks that are about to die due to a very pissed of France. 
What I don't understand is...if they knew the command center was there, why wasn't it bombed long ago?  Why does it take a tragedy to spark this sort of action?
So when America gets attacked by terrorists and they bomb Muslims, Reddit tells me we're just making the problem worse.  When France gets attacked and they bomb Muslims, Reddit celebrates...
I heard Raqqa's water and electricity supplies are kaput too thanks to these airstrikes.

Rest in piss ISIS. Literally.
The ISIS militants and its fanatic leaders will simply melt away into their safe havens scattered around the middle east.  This is not the same thing as WW2 where you can just bomb the crap out of your enemies' cities and infrastructure and expect them to surrender.
This was already happening before the attacks in Paris. Why do you think they attacked?
Long live France!!! 
No matter which way this end, if it ever ends, it's deeply depressing on all accounts.  
I'm deeply depressed by all this.
Shit on their dicks France!
Entendez-vous dans les campagnes
Mugir ces féroces soldats ?	
Ils viennent jusque dans vos bras	
Égorger vos fils, vos compagnes !
I hope they make them pay. Fuck ISIS. 
I'm sick of seeing these apologist idiots who somehow think that western foreign policy somehow justifies terrorism, that somehow France and NATO are now the bad guys and they 'brought it on themselves' or 'created ISIS'. 

Western armies don't send suicide bombers to crowded stadiums, the don't enter concert halls and murder people in cold blood, they don't enslave populations because of a different religion, and they don't blow up passenger jets of innocent people. We are clearly better than the people who do these things. 

I'm sick of seeing all these 'but the US is the world's terrorist' posts. In the wake of what just happened, it's completely morally reprehensible and you should be ashamed if you're part of that sad group.
Let's put things in their context.

France has been bombing ISIS for quite a while. The aicraft carrier [Charles de Gaulle was *planned* to go to the Gulf](http://news.usni.org/2015/01/07/french-carrier-deploy-indian-ocean-join-isis-fight) before the attacks in Paris occurred.

So, with a (very very very) little bit of luck, it allows the French government to say "see, we reacted immediately". 
Eat shit isis cunts
&gt; There is never any ending to Paris, and the memory of each person who has lived in it differs from that of any other... Paris was always worth it **and you received return for whatever you brought to it.**

Earnest Hemingway, A Moveable Feast.
Reddit is so fucking bizarre. Almost every comment was "Something has to be done about this!"

Now that France is doing something, people are like "Can't we do something else?"

No. We can't.
It always astounds me that religion has been the root causes over these wars. The conflicts that reside within the Sunni and Shi'ite war never ceases to amaze me
THE FRENCH ARE COMING 
I love all the comments calling this a "vicious cycle". You're right- it *is* a vicious cycle called "the human condition". And that is unfortunate. But it's part of being a human. People have struggled with the evilness of war, even very just war, since there have been people and will struggle for as long as people exist. You can't eradicate every single unfair thing under the face of the sun, such as bloodshed and war. Sorry, but it won't happen. I would argue people have a moral obligation to fight injustice, but there are some injustices that will always persist and civilian casualty during armed conflict is one of them. This is the only way to deal with ISIS and anyone else who attacks your country and people. And if another terrorist group pops up in their wake, we eradicate them, too, until they start to get the picture. I care more about the safety of myself, my family, my country and the rest of the world, and if you don't feel the same way you are lying to save face. Sorry. 
Way i look at it, do anything and everything to wipe those cunts off the earth
War is ugly. It is in no way civilized. Geneva Convention be damned, when it comes down to it, war is in and of itself inhumane. 

The only way to ensure no one attacks you is to make it too costly, which requires a certain amount of ruthlessness in retaliation.

I don't applaud attacks on civilians. In wartime, it's inevitable. The only way to entirely avoid hurting innocents is to not go to war with anyone. Unfortunately, that hasn't ever worked in the history of ever.
I can't believe how sanctimonious and fucking condescending some of the replies on here are, people being disgusted that France is thirsty for blood, or saying its not right they are bombing Raqqa because of the civilians there?!

It must be nice being able to sit in your houses in your cities that weren't attacked, putting up your Facebook photos with the tricolour on it and posting Facebook messages to make it look like you give a shit.

Do you fucking blame these people for bombing the shit out of the people who landed a devastating terror attack on their home soil, brutally murdering innocent people for no gain other than to incite terror? Have you not seen the pictures of the people who were blown up in that theatre?!

What in FUCKS NAME do you expect paris and france to do right now? Of course they are going to retaliate, they've just been attacked in their capital and you expect them to sit there pussy footing around. Have you seen Paris lately? Everytime theres a small noise or someone acts suspiciously people are fucking running for their lives because they think they're about to be murdered!

He's bombing Raqqa?! GOOD. Atleast France has the bollocks to retaliate.
We've been bombing this shit for 15 years. Nothing will come of this. It's purely symbolic. Barring a ground assault and occupation nothing will change. 
When France bombs the absolute fuck out of you, you need to take a step back and ask yourself, "Am I being an asshole?"
Wow, I've literally never read more brainwashed nonsense than I'm finding here.  This reads like an adaptation of 1984.
No one's calling for mass genocide at all. More civilians will die if they don't do anything. Get your head out of your ass. War is war, and it always will be. Civilians die. France and other countries that are combating IS, are not fucking targeting civilians; however, IS is specifically targeting innocent civilians. Going into fucking restaurants, theaters and streets shooting anyone. 
As much as I hate to decry the killing of these terrible people, military interventionism is not a long term solution, it is a long term problem. These bombings may kill today's terrorists, but they also create tomorrow's.  

We need to wage a war on ignorance, not a war on terror. We need to use different weapons, like education, global internet access, and sanctions to enforce civil equality for all humans. The solution is a long, grueling process of educating the global population. We should take every precaution to defend ourselves along the way but we need to stop perpetuating the problem.
Serious question. What is the best way to wipe out ISIS? Sure you can contain them militarily but ISIS spreads a message, an ideology that is extreme and in sync with radical islam. How do you stop the propoganda? You can try and kill them all and I'm all for it, but the other war that must be waged is against their toxic message and I still haven't heard anyone give a concrete solution or even officially ackowledge solutions being put in place...
Oviously these ISIS bastards are as bad(if not worst) than Hitler. Why cant the world just come together and say; "lets wipe these fuckers off the face of the earth"? 

Fuck this strategic shit. Blitz their retarded asses down, fuck the bullshit.
Why only 20??
Make it news when they start the carpet bombing.
France is conducting anti-terror raids on towns in france right now. CNN just reported.
I hope France rips them a new one.
[deleted]
Wow, all of these blood thirsty comments remind me of the time leading up to Iraq.
So many experts here. 
As much as I appreciate the need to respond, I feel for the innocent civilians in Raqqa who are caught in this conflict.
ITT: Reddit turning back to being anti-war after being mercilessly frothing at the mouth pro-war.
ISIS is a savage group that needs to be stopped, but can we all take a step back and try to examine why this and other jihadi extremist groups have come into existence and found at least some popular support in the areas they occupy? Think about the civilian death toll that has been exacted upon the middle east over the past several decades. If hundreds of thousands of innocent European or American civilians had been killed, or our lands occupied, what would be our reaction? Would we not be desperate for retribution?

France has declared that the Paris attack was an "act of war". Was France not already dropping bombs on the region before this act of war?

I'm by no means saying that ISIS should not be stopped, but by who? Why do countries so far away have a responsibility to stop a group that is in the backyard of other developed and armed countries? This is not our fight, and if we insist on making it our fight, we need to admit to the terrible truth that our deeds are at least partially responsible for the extremism in that region! 

How can we possibly end this cycle of retribution and warfare and come up with a working plan-of-action if we are not honest with ourselves?

Edit: Thank you kind stranger!
And the cycle continues...
What would you have people do? Just sit back and let ISIS keep bombing and murdering? From what you people are saying, they should be allowed to keep spreading terror unchecked, solely because you think retaliation causes more problems and life lost. So what exactly is the answer to this riddle? I only see two options. Spend all our resources hoping to stop a few of these attacks before they happen. Live our short lives surrounded by terror. Or, try to obliterate the threat completely. There is no middle ground. There is no talking or diplomacy with zealots. Kill them or be killed. You may not like the options, but life's not simple and easy. It's easy to sit in your nice comfortable home thousands of miles away and pass judgement. I've fought this enemy face to face. I've seen how black and corrupt their souls are. They would kill that child that you love more than life itself, and they wouldn't think twice. It would be like smashing a bug to them. They don't value any life whatsoever. So in my eyes, they aren't human. If they aren't stopped, they will try to burn our world to the ground around us. Kill them all. 
I hate to say this, but it is true: 

If we are going to go to war, we need to approach it with relentless aggression.  If we have to carpet bomb cities to wipe out ISIS, with the danger of collateral losses, then it needs to be done.

In reality, it is the only way to decisively win a war and do it quickly.  You end up losing MUCH fewer people in the long run.

A long, drawn-out war or campaign, fighting with one hand behind our back because of progressive policy is what slowly drains a country of it's resources, and ultimately causes greater losses in the long run.

For example, if we were to fight ISIS, Taliban or Al Qaeda the way the U.S. is CAPABLE of fighting, the war would have been over within weeks.  

But we do not fight wars like that any more.  World War 2, we took the enemy head on during the Pacific and European fronts.  We decisively ended the war with two massive bombs over Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  Was there collateral damages?  Yes.  Was there civilian casualties?  Yes.  But the reality is, the largest WAR that man has ever experienced - a war with multiple superpower countries - was ended in just 4.5 years because of decisive action.

It is sad, but that is the risk that Japan took when they preemptively attacked another country that was not involved in the war at that time.  

We need to decisively handle this the way we are capable of handling it: Quickly, Harshly and Decisively.

It is the only real way to stop the threat and establish a time of peace.  There is no other way, unfortunately.  Until we put this into practice, we are going to continue to be the victim of the extremists.

Is this a popular opinion?  No, and certainly not here on Reddit.  

Sometimes there isn't a good option.  Sometimes there is only one option.
The poo has properly hit le fan.
Fuck em up France. ISIS deserves no mercy.
That's how it starts. The fever. The rage. The feeling of powerlessness. That turns good men.. cruel
This is going to get downvoted, but this bombing of Syria ISIS targets isn't going to deter them one bit, they are already in France, Europe, the world, waiting to strike again. They don't care what happens now in that part of the world they are going to cause more attacks on other countries. 
Syrian Week Forcast: http://imgur.com/JJqTjZH
Those of you who are against these bombings: What is your alternate solution to taking down ISIS?
Wasn't expecting that. Anyone got any idea on the damage? 
French here, Erase Raqqa.
Exactly what ISIS wants.  More civilian collateral damage.  Eliminate the grey area.

The war of terror is going great.


This thread is chock of retardedly worrying comments
Don't the targets sound made up? Like if we knew for certain where all the "training centers" and barracks were, wouldn't we have taken them out months ago? 
Seems absurd.
1.) Fuck ISIS for the terror and pain they've caused to so many innocent people.

2.) Is there any more evidence than ISIS's word that they were responsible for the Paris attacks? They need to be stopped, but could they be trying to take what they consider "credit" for an act they didn't commit.
the scary thing is what happens next ?
Air power alone will never be able to destroy a reasonably determined and dug in foe of sufficient size. ISIS has enough forces and has had enough time to make preparations that airstrikes cannot defeat them, short of being far more indiscriminate with weapon selection and targeting, which is not going to happen. An invasion might be the order of the day to destroy existing ISIS forces and scatter them. But how can a global power destroy the ideology that gives rise to ISIS? That is a much more difficult question and one for which I have not heard a convincing answer.  
https://youtu.be/bsCZzpmbEcs ....documentary on how its like to be inside Raqqa under ISIS. Its from Aug-2014 ....still horrific.
https://politicalevolutionblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/14/the-failure-of-our-foreign-policy-terrorism-violence-and-devistation/
The west have failed in their foreign policy of perpetual war.
This is just the beginning. Things are going to get a lot worse soon.
This will definitely stop small scale attacks (which this was, despite how inarguably horrible it was) from loosely-if-at-all organized groups of pissed off maniacs with no uniforms, flag, or particular need for a specific base of operations.

If anything this will drive further recruiting. Have we not learned yet that this "solution" isn't one?
[deleted]
"Bombings will continue until morale improves."
From Paris with love
Am I wrong or France already bombed ISIS in Syria a couple of weeks ago?
Bombers bombing bombers.  Fixed all related problems in the past right?  Go Bombers!
How does bombing them prevent attacks on european soil?

They have supporters on every continent (maybe except antarctica) and do not require their syrian/iraq infrastructure (it might make things easier for them, sure) to plan attacks here. Some guys sitting in a basement somewhere in Asia or South America are certainly capable of producing propaganda to recruite new fighters in the US or Europe who can then carry out devastating attacks.

Wouldn't it me more important to solve the "ghetto" problem in France, Belgium and parts of Germany (to make said propaganda find less recipients and to prevent lone wolf attacks which are even less predictable) and increase the security on outer schengen borders instead of mindlessly crying for blood and potentionally making it worse in the process (isn't that "us vs. them" one of the goals they want to achieve)?
I would guess that there is lots of intel about isis positions. It is past the time to put it to use. France don't stop. Other nations need to join in and put and end to isis. 
These were planned beforehand as far as we know, and it's not like they're unleashing mass destruction without any planning. I'm with them.

That being said it's interesting to read public opinion of France doing this, and the overwhelming (by and large) support for it. It's a stark contrast to what is usually said about the U.S. or Great Britain (for example) when they carry out bombing runs.
Bombing is great, but ISIS gets bombed every weekend. 

Why aren't we going for the heart of the problem? Some of the terrorists who were responsible for the massacre in Paris were able to sneak in through the current refugee flow. That is a massive, massive breach of security. 

Either close the borders or extremely slow down on the refugee intake, it's not worth risking another massacre to let this go on and a part of me fears that it's already too late and there are terrorist cells already established across Europe. 
Well done France, fuck the doubters, this needs to be done for the greater good, as absolutely awful as it is. France knows it's opening itself and probably Europe up to many more attacks, but this will NOT end on the path it's been taking the past few years.
Would that dumb bitch that ran away to join ISIS and whose opinion on the terror attacks in Tunisia was "LOL" be counted as a civilian casualty or not?
War boners, war boners all around. Why don't we just kill them all? That will work just like it did in Iraq and Afghanistan! I am a redditor, I am rational, and my emotions never get the best of me! /s
200k civilians live in Raqqa most are innocent, if the death count exceeds 200+ (Might be a little more than the recent count in Paris) then isn't that a worse travesty then it already is? if we want to assign the blame game it would go both ways. France has been doing air strikes on Isis for a whole (I'm not insinuating Isis aren't terrible fucks who don't deserve it however if you go shoot at someone expect them to shoot back), so it's bound to have a back lash and this was it, now due to this grievance more civilians with a terrorist like mind set will rise. The best revenge is education, and guerrilla tactics like the Uk have been doing. I can't celebrate death, reddit do you. 
Give 'em hell!
Good.
Blowing them up before they blow up themselves.
Yay France !!!!
Well ISIS pretty much fucked up the chances of innocent Syrians being welcomed in any country.
forget everything I ever said about the french being pushovers.
FUCK THEM UP
Vive La France!!
Die slow isis, you fucking worthless scum.
I have been a huge supporter of understanding and reasoned response knowing that overly aggressive attacks can have a negative impact actually increasing recruitment and strengthening the anti west mentality ... at this point fuck them level the place hopefully we can deal with the aftermath in a reasonable way 
Need to eradicate the fucking lot like we did to the nazis
as an american who isnt much of a jingoist, im glad other countries are getting involved in fucking up isis.

If they knew about these targets, why wait until 200 innocent people got murdered in Paris to take them out.  They should have already been taken out.
&gt; The bombers hit a jihadi recruitment centre, training camp and arms depot run by the extremist group, according to the French defence ministry.

Why were these places NOT already bombed to smithereens? What was everyone waiting for? 
Make it rain on these scum of the earth 
[deleted]
IS fighters said they carried out the gun and bomb massacre - calling Paris "the capital of prostitution and obscenity".




ISIS members have obviously never been to Las Vegas before.
Guy who pressed the button must've felt pretty good.
Are we really not going to question how these fuckers are getting financed? All of this advanced and no doubt expensive technology that allowed them to easily plan 7 attacks in a single country in one day and no one asks, "gee, where'd this shit come from?" You can't tell me that all of this equipment was not tested in some remote region where intelligence is most certainly present, and which even in the article as it was mentioned, was now bombed by France today. Why was it bombed after almost 200 people died and not before? I'm not trying to get all "everything is a conspiracy, illuminati, etc." but let's not be taking everything at face value here. They magically find a passport of one of the bombers after he blows himself to shreds? Unless that passport is made of indestructible bullshit, there's no way I am buying that. I want a conversation other than "good guys vs. Bad guys", because sometimes it turns out that the good guys are actually bad guys too. We have 0 physical evidence that jihadi John is even dead just like there was no fucking proof that Osama bin Laden is dead because we decided to "throw his remains in the sea". SOMEONE DISCUSS THIS
Does anyone remember last week it was reported that Italian authorities uncovered a big terrorist plot?

Any connection to the Paris attack?
I have never looked down on anyone fleeing an oppressive country to save the lives of themselves or their families. 

Fuck everything about what Syria has turned into. 


WHY are the several hundred Muslim french fighters who went to Syria for training and came back not deported out of the country? 
Well if we keep bombing them it will breed more hate and it never ends. Members of ISIS would just be farmers, taxi drivers or students if it wasn't for the Iraq war. This generation of Iraqis have grown up in a war thats cost 2 million lives. Think some one who is 10 in 2003 is 22 now. All they've seen is there country invaded by Christians who have brought death and destruction.  Expect some of them to be fucked up. 

Yes "Jihad in your context is a media definition of a fight against unbelievers "
Jihads true definition is a personal fight against sin.

I do bot believe in any god. But I do know if you look at whats making this hate, bombing is not the answer. We will just make another generation grow up surrounded by death and destruction and breed more hate. Hate against the people dropping the bombs.
I read it as "France Drops 20 Bombs On IS Stronghold Kappa"...

I guess I'm on Twitch too much
Can we all stop and think for a minute? People here are voting "fuck their civilians, we lost 100 real people". This is insane. Fuck, do you think all their aggression comes from nowhere?
And so it begins
This reminds me of when I was in high school after 9/11.  Everyone was all gung ho to go blow up the ter-er-ists and we lost our bill of rights.  I see France doing the same thing soon (maybe they already have, I admit I'm inept).
Fuck their shit up hard, France.

We stand by whatever actions you take.
That's great because I don't think we've tried the whole bombing strategy enough. A few more bombs ought to do the trick.
France to world: No worries mates... Were aiming;)

 Keep it up comarades! Viva la France!
The second France backs off all of Europe is lost

Brave choice and the only right one, I hope my country follows France' lead soon !


"Celebrating the deaths of innocent people, what a vile world we live in."  

http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/619363/Islamic-State-ISIS-Twitter-Paris-attacks
That'll be one of several air raids, then that will be it. Won't do anything. This shit is gonna get a lot worse and its at our doorstep too.
Honestly as much as I hate the idea of anyone innocent being killed, Id much rather roll the dice in Syria in the town where ISIS is.. I know people there arent all villains and i feel bad for them but I like many others would rather ISIS be stamped out now with very small chances of innocent casualties that end than get a call my parents/sisters/friends saying that someone I love has died a sensless meaningless death due to small minded hatred. 

As much as killing sucks, France is trying to remove an evil from the world.

Its easy for us to judge and get angry at bombings and wars but the longer this goes on for the more people are going to die and thats not something you can take back. 

Edit: some people who arent very good at reading are seeing this as "go bombs go!" which is far from what it says. Any loss of innocent life is sickening and anyone who argues that also is. 

this is fucked up.
As much as I know and understand that these bombings are necessary to cripple and eradicate these shit stains masquerading as human beings, I can't help but think about the civilian casualities that will undoubtedly result from such aerial bombings. To me at least, it is an incredibly sad situation that humanity can't live in peace and has to resort to war which becomes absolutely necessary in these conditions. This isn't a cause for celebration, this world is a shitty place.
The reality is that air strikes are not going to be as effective as the insertion of ground forces. By now the terrorists have adapted to the air campaigns. Air strikes are effective against a building/communication infrastructure, armor, supply routes, and stores. Against personnel and light armor, it's neither cost effective or sustainable to stay 5 miles above the conflict for much longer and expect progress. 
  
We'll have to see if the French and their allies develop the stomach to bring the fight to the ground. 
  
Fred Thompson on the carrier deck in Hunt for Red October said it best....
  
This may be really stupid, but let's just take all the oil. No more funding for terrorists. 
I hope I'm wrong, but this smells like a knee-jerk decision like the US's decision to go into Iraq.  I hope you've got it right, France.  Hope to God you do.
Any civilian casualties?
"refugees" 
wahhhhhh,  but but but this will never win their hearts and minds and just make more terrorists!!!  wahhhh..


guess fucking what--you'll never win the hearts and minds of brainwashed idiots that still believe in a fairy tale religion that belongs in the 5th century.  make more terrorists by bombing?  fine.  make more bombs and bullets for them.  
Why haven't these sites — a "jihadi recruitment centre, training camp and arms depot run by the extremist group" — been hit before? Why wait until now?
Never thought I'd say this, but France ain't fucking around.  Get em boys.  We're right behind you.
From Paris, with love
Social media has literally never been this obnoxious. Mind blowing. 
Drop 20 more tomorrow and every day after till there's no city left to drop on.
The time for half-measures is over. I get the argument that this breeds more terrorists, but we need to be clear here: if joining a terrorist organization is your reaction to retaliation against an act of war you are wrong and if you join ISIS or any other group like that you WILL be killed. 

If you are a would-be sympathizer of ISIS or if you are even remotely thinking that, hell, if you live in the area and are seeing the world around you being bombed know 1 thing:

The Islamic State, ISIS, did this to you, not France, not the USA, not any other nation. ISIS did this by committing an act of war, so stand up to them and help kick them out of your city, out of your country.

This will get buried, but this has been simmering inside since Friday.

We are not at war with ISIS.  France, is not at war with ISIS.  We are at war with evil.  Whether it goes by the name of ISIS...or al Qaeda...or Hezbollah....or Lashkar e Taiba...makes no difference.  We are at war with evil.  We will never fully defeat it.  Our world will never fully rid itself of evil.  But what we must do is chase it to the gates of hell as quickly and as often as we can.  It is our only option.  Godspeed, France.
What am I reading in the comments here?

I mean seriously, are we all 12 all of a sudden?  Is it the year 2000 again? Did 9/11 never happen? 

"Oh, it's a bummer if France kills civilians, but annihilates ISIS in the process'.  

Honestly, more innocent civilians probably get killed by Western retaliation than are killed by ISIS.  Sure, this attack may have been very precise, efficient and accurate, but there's plenty that aren't.  Look at Iraq/Afghanistan.  Then we wonder why there's hatred and extremist groups such as ISIS in the world coming to bomb our cities.  It's nonsensical.  
Same old cycle. They never learn. More Civilian deaths -&gt; More families torn apart -&gt; More desperation, anger -&gt; More vulnerable people that ISIS can recruit. ISIS win either way, they have more propaganda material this way. I understand the French' reaction, I'm just not sure this is the right way to go about it.
Will probably be unpopular, but the "superpower" countries of the world need to quit playing with kid gloves.

Attempting a proportionate response guarantees ISIS's continued existence and a continuing of this tit-for-tat bombing/attack/bombing/attack....

The powerful countries need to say enough is enough.  Any area that we know that ISIS occupies, will be immediatly reduced to rubble, it would be almost effortless for us to do.  Do not fight with one hand tied behind your back.


For anyone else bitching about this....can you tell me what you would do? 
All of you hating on the "warmongering", what is your perfect solution with no civilian casualties that ends terrorism forever? Fill us in on the secret. 
Civilians will die.  It's the horrible, tragic but unavoidable truth.   They don't fight like traditional armies (nor should they).  If we want to win we will need to accept this unfortunate fact. 
If I can count the bombs its not enough.
Violence begets more violence.
France is creating more terrorists. 
As a Moroccan muslim, FUCK YEAH. Please just get rid of those animals, be it a simple attack or a WWIII, the world (and Islam) will be so better off without those f*ckers.
Shit is going down!
Why is everyone calling them IS now? Did something change? I dislike it, it's harder to say out loud. 
"No CIA operatives reported dead"
Same did Egypt USA Russia...
Net geopolitical result?

Nothing.
How have conflicts such as these ended in the past?

I wonder if this will be anything like Jordan's response to the execution of one of their soldiers.  A whole lot of anger and bluster, a few bombs dropped, and then... nothing.  And ISIS is stronger than ever.
France claim responsibility for Raqqa bombing
I'm guessing that those targets where ones that the US and possibly Russia already had lined up to bomb and this is simply a great opportunity to give the locations to a new ally.  
The Saudi princelings have their checkbooks open to rebuild their ISIS cousins' military training grounds.
I'm looking foward to all the new refugee's fleeing from bombs in Raqqa
Good for Daesh. Let's hope there were little to no civillian casualties.
get it done
The Raqqa civilian twitter account says no civilians have been killed but do mention that it always rains bombs on them 
Not trying to be a smartass, but what is the significance of this stronghold? What goes on in it?
20 bombs is nothing. The U.S. alone has conducted over 1700 just in Syria. This is symbolic at best.
&gt;"The scale of these French airstrikes should not be seen as a wanton act of revenge, but really the French basically saying to their allies, 'we want to do all of the airstrikes' over the next period of time - however long that may be."

WTF? It's not revenge, it's France saying "We want to kill them from now on". Oh okay. As long as it's not revenge..... Who gives a shit if it's revenge? Are they supposed to fly them over there and try them in court? It's a fucking war. 
Fallout 5 
I don't understand the motivation behind this. Airstrikes predominantly factor in civilian casualties, which is playing into ISIS gameplay. What needs to happen is a NATO Article 5 resolution, put all forces into Iraq and Syria, and push the Peshmerga into Raqqa. Then rebuild the country. This is a situation where full on, Desert Storm tactics are required. Airstrikes have become a crutch for the west. We can win this war easily, we just all need to put our efforts into it.
Coming from just watching the start of a Fallout 4 walkthrough to this is very unnerving.
don't poke the bear
It's sad we will have to forget about this attack 10 years from now and the same thing will happen somewhere else. When will we stop letting our guard down?
[Time to get real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7zhZmcwwLM)
Guy Check out the statement ISIS Issued claiming responsiblity for the attacks.. It's fucked up. You'll be fucking pissed after you read it trust me. http://www.vox.com/2015/11/14/9734794/isis-claim-paris-statement
Woo~ Great job my boys
This was the maximum France could do on short notice, kind of let's you know their resources in the area. I'm sure they are sending more as we speak though.
This shit is going in the history books.
This should work, so long as you didn't already encourage thousands of them to come to your country.

Oh, wait.
good. lets keep them coming.
Based France
Damn. Welcome to WWIII
All this ISIS killings! Going to start running out of 72 virgins here soon...
Isn't this the drug that Saudi Prince was caught trying to sneak 100's of pounds of into the country on his private jet?
*edit SPELLING
since when are amphetamines halal?
 "have speculated that the drug (Captagon) is being used by Islamic State fighters, the biggest consumer has for years been Saudi Arabia. In 2010, a third of the world's supply — about seven tons — ended up in Saudi Arabia, according to Reuters."

When you measure your amphetamine habit by the metric ton, you might have a problem.
&gt;The tiny pill fueling Syria’s war and turning fighters into superhuman soldiers

Overstatement of the fucking year...
Sounds like the usage of speed by the Nazis during Blitzkrieg. 

http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-nazi-death-machine-hitler-s-drugged-soldiers-a-354606.html

Not the only similarity.
If the public knew how many uppers were on a US aircraft carrier they would lose their shit.
I have a great idea for a tv show- a syrian chemistry teacher loses his job due the civil war, but rather than taking his family to europe as refugees, he decides to team up with one of his former students to make captagon for ISIS. All under the nose of his wife's brother-in-law, who is a member of Assad's secret police... 
I think I'll call it "Breaking Jihad".
Who can tell me how to set up a pitch meeting?
&gt;Side effects include "psychosis and brain damage"

At least they have nothing to worry about.
You know it's good writing when the takeaway from the article is " sounds great, I should get me a couple of them pills". 
It must be finals week in Syria.
Someone needs to switch out their Captagon with MDMA and put an end to this insurrection.
#1. Purchase hundreds of pounds of this shit.
#2. Fill it with radioactive tracer with long half-life, like tritium.
#3. Allow tainted drug to "slip" into Syria, and fall into the hands of rebels
#4. Secretly equip border patrol agents, TSA, and other organizations with devices to quickly test for the tracer.
This is a problematic article at best. For one thing - Amphetamines and similar drugs don't actually, you know, do the shit that the article alleges. They mostly make you hyper and keep you awake, they don't turn you in to the terminator. Additionally - Lots of militaries use amphetamines to keep their soldiers awake and alert. The US Air Foce uses amphetamines for this purpose. So if amphetamines are turning Syrian fighters in to numb combat monsters what are they doing to the US pilots dropping bombs on the Syrians? It's just a dumb propaganda article mixing inaccurate information, speculation, and sensationalism. This is tawdry reporting. 

[Article on US use of amphetamines by combat pilots](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3071789/ns/us_news-only/t/go-pills-war-drugs/#.Vk6wJ9KrTMw)

[Wiki article that mentions use by US Airforce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine#History.2C_society.2C_and_culture)
So, jet?
This is nothing new in the military.  US pilots were given amphetamines so they could fly long missions without fatigue.  Soldiers have been known to use methamphetamine too to get through days long firefights.  This drug isn't why ISIS is crazy.  They are just using a stimulant like many armies have used before.  Making them out as drug-crazed psychopaths is disingenuous and is basically just propaganda.  They are psychopaths without the drugs.        
You smoke a lot of ciggys when you speed like that. no sleeping and chain smoking. your chest hurts after a day or 2..... 
This gives the term 'War on Drugs', a whole new meaning...
It also turns their eyes blue.
The drug is "fenethylline" and sounds like someone with a lisp trying to say *penicillin*
Not much different than the amphetamines students use to study. 
This just in:  Soldiers in war use drugs to make them less aware of the fact that they are in a war.  More at 11.

EDIT:  I mean less aware of their feelings, not the environment.  If your high you don't care so much about the fact that you are constantly about to die.
Who makes this drug?
"psychosis and brain damage"

So, business as usual then . . . . .
So Starcraft Stim Packs?

*Tch* AW YEAH!
**Drugs, euphoria, killing, freedom, blood, ..my blood?, darkness.. 72 virgins!**

You can see the appeal.
Will this work for me when I need to stay up for days and work instead of procrastinating? 
Why do people make life so crazy and weird? Just chill and eat something
omg so scared by propaganda. Give them a constant supply of cold energy drinks and chipotle and I'll be scared. 
Sounds like the same thing half the kids in the US are being issued--I mean prescribed--for school.  Adderall, Dexadrine, and Ritalin, oh my! 
No shocker there for those of us who served in Iraq. Insurgents and Iraqi police/military ate these things like Skittles.
The biggest drug they are on is their radical islam ideology.
Soldiers using amphetamine? This is unheard of. 
Thanks Obama
Follow the Money - Terrorism is Big Business

ISIS and al-Qaeda are Wahhabi terrorists. ALL of the "rebels" in Syria are Wahhabis (except for the Kurds).

The cult of Wahhabism is the religion of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and most of the other Gulf States.

Saudi Arabia spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year promulgating the extremist and violent cult of Wahhabism in various places around the world.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar spent at least hundreds of millions of dollars arming al-Qaeda terrorists from around Benghazi to overthrow Gaddafi.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar spent $3bn each arming al-Qaeda and ISIS terrorists in Syria to overthrow Assad, just in the first 2 years of the Syrian war.

The CIA has been spending around $1bn a year on arming and funding ISIS and al-qaeda terrorists in Syria since 2011.

The CIA also supplied arms and logistical support to the al-qaeda terrorists in Libya in the Spring of 2011, to overthrow Gaddafi.

The US, the UK and France support the terrorist promoting and despotic regimes of Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States and sell them billions of dollars worth of arms.

The US, UK and French governments actively support the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar in their funding, recruitment, training and arming of Wahhabi terrorist groups. More terrorism means that there are also more arms sales by US, UK and Freench arms companies to their own governments and to the rest of the world.

ISIS HATES THEM!! FIND OUT WHY WITH THIS ONE SIMPLE TRICK!
[I LEARNED IT FROM YOU!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWMU-vX1VIM)
This isn't news. During the first years of the Iraq war, many al Qaeda fighters were high on amphetamines while fighting. 
Its similar to Somalia during the mid 90's. Late afternoon raids were loathed by U.S. forces because all of Mohamed Farrah Aidid's guys were hopped up on Khat. Khat is still huge in that region.
Western nations in the pass wars used amphetamines to give their pilots a little extra zip while the bombed stuff
The U.S. Military issues amphetamines to some of its pilots for use in emergencies.

The program is voluntary and strictly regulated; pilots have to undergo testing prior to being issues the amphetamines. But once they're approved, they basically keep them in their flight suits, and if they have a mission that goes on for an extended period, they can use the amphetamines to stay alert.
Jem'Hadar, eat your hearts out.
But no alcohol and cigarettes...

Idiots. 

Note to a censor: Idiot is a medical definition for people, who lack certain mental abilities. 
Well they were already psychotic and brain damaged.
Captagon sounds like something made in the Pentagon
Psycho in real life.
Meth was the drug used by Germans and Japanese.
I guess smuggling manipulated shipments into the country (mixed with rat poison, replaced with impure crystal meth ect.) would both lower their numbers and effectiveness. And one wouldn't even have to feel bad about poisoning these guys. :)
Anyone else thinking Blackwood Company from Oblivion?
&gt;the drug can be purchased for less than $20 a tablet and is popular among those Syrian fighters *who don't follow strict interpretations of Islamic law*, according to the Guardian.

Well that rules out ISIS then. They're Salafists. They don't come any stricter than that.
This is not news. Fighter pilots, truckers, any manner of entertainers, and (clearly) journalists have used amphetamine and it's various sister chemicals to varying degrees of success since we learned to use ephedra before recorded history. This and the Saudi prince attempting to smuggle the drug may prove for an entertaining cascade of knockoff non-stories, though.
2 years late. you guys are really, really slow. they take it to stay hyped up and fight with no hesitation. they get a "rambo" feeling from it.
Isn't this a clear link showing that Saudi Arabia is directly linked to funding ISIS?

Eh we have drugs like that our soldiers take too. Maybe not as dangerous but the goal is to allow days of combat without sleep.
Theater in France is opening back up for business like they give zero fucks, but apparently redditors on the other side of the planet are still shitting their beds with anxiety about ISIS.
Sheer sensationalism to bill this as some sort of super drug. According to this article http://www.smarternootropics.com/2014/01/captagon-the-smart-drug-fuelling-syrias-civil-war/, it's less intense in effect at a given dosage than Adderall, and we legally give that shit to millions of ADD and ADHD patients.
So much misinformation. 

Captagon is a drug which is metabolized into Amphetamine and Theophylline(related to caffeine). In nearly all practical aspects it is identical to adderall(Amphetamine).

To those who say that's only real Captagon and the counterfeited drugs are meth. Methamphetamine consumed orally is also nearly identical to Amphetamine in affect.

Speed is speed is speed.
so no side effects then....

(psycosis and brain damage is prerequisite to join daesh)
should try Jet or Psycho
What does their religion say about drug use?  Serious question...I know they can't drink, but are drugs forbidden as well? 
I think they had brain damage fucking before they started killing people.
This comment section makes me miss when OxyElite had DMAA in it. What a time that was.
i wont lie, they way they made it sound in the article makes me want to try some. I mean.. shit i like drugs just like the next guy. hook a brotha up? no i dont want to kill anybody, i just want to get high :-/
Most armies in most wars of the last century have used "pep pills", US Army not excluded.
Why can't we cut off the arms deals to them? Why are they able to finance their war based primarily... (from what I understand they get their money from oil fields)... and we can't manage to cut off that funding??!?!? None of this makes any sense 
Every kind of mind altering drug is absolutely forbidden under Islam.

Just sayin...
you can draw your own conclusions who is supporting those terrorists called ISIS or "moderate opposition"

http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/saudi-royal-four-others-detained-beirut-captagon-bust-n451486
This sounds like its straight out of *Brisingr*, when Galbatorix cast spells on his soliders so they couldn't feel pain and they would just keep numbly fighting until they died. Pretty strange that this is real.
ah, so this is why we're supporting the "rebels" (pro democracy terrorists), they are revitalizing the pharmaceutical industry. /s
As if theyre not brain damaged enough....
Brain damage on already damaged pigs. 
TIL that a lot of redditors use Adderal or straight speed.
Stimulant induced psychosis is a yes.  However, you can simply sleep for a bit and it will go away.

"Brain damage" will not occur except over long periods of time of heavy abuse.  It destroys dopamine receptors in the same way high, repetitive doses of amphetamine or methamphetamine does here in the west.

Media sensationalism at its finest!
I picture them using it like the guys in the mad max movie when they spray paint silver on there mouth right before battle
So they are like WW2 wakie-wakie pills?
Pretty sure that there was a drug like this in the recent game 'Dying Light' used by the enemy soldiers. 
And here I thought drugs were supposed to be haram (sin)....
Side effects of religion
Is there an antidote for Captagon?  We could lace arrows with an antidote and jihad mother fucker would snap the fuck out of it, crash and go to sleep. Then we tie him up and off to be executed n style without any pain killers.

I'm reminded of the different formulas based on Bane's Venom formula in the Batman games.

Man no wonder everyone is so tense over there all the time!
&gt;" Side effects include "psychosis and brain damage"

Well that would explain.... a lot.
Is it the same amphetamine that US pilots used?
Am on amphetamines &amp; other stimulants, can't keep me awake on a fucking 45 minute bus ride.  What is wrong with me? (am *not* narcoleptic)
Psychosis and brain damage are possible side effects of not sleeping for several days, not direct effects of the drug itself.
:(


We have a saying in french that says "Religion is people's opium". 
  
 I guess opium just wasn't cutting it anymore...
Who owns the manufacturing plant?

Is this a ploy to get them fighting no matter what and prolong instability in the region? 
FYI  this drug is also common among high-school students (in saudi arabia)  who develop an addiction shortly after.

So basically it's amphetamine combined with some chemical similar to caffeine...


Muslims using drugs.  Isn't that against their things.
Hmm, might be overstated but all the same, drug abuse in an anarchic warzone isn't anything new. 

And here's me thinking that the US military would be the first to widely use combat stims. 
Wasn't cocaine used by the army during world war 2? Especially for soldiers behind enemy lines and trying to either infiltrate or escape.

Anyone who willfully harms an unarmed human civilian is the most sinister of all beings. The evil consuming these soulsucking idiots cannot even be spoken. I hope one day ignorant fools like any radical religious buffoon are non existent. Then we will know humanity has hope.

Buffjet....fucking killllll
whats strange is that is drug is almost exclusively made and sold in the middle east. You cannot find this drug for sale on the streets or even on any market on the dark net.
So, speed.
as someone who has done a fair bit of meth, I can only imagine that this is bad news for any forces long term military readiness. After a few days you are seeing shit and have NO focus or concentration. After weathering the initial onslaught a counter attack would be very effective, I suggest.
Oh yes but we are the infidels because we drink and listen to music.. But it's okay to be hyped up on amphetamines #hypocrisy
This is one of those headlines that people just desperately want to be true because it dehumanizes these people.  
And same as the case with Hitler and many nazis that isn't considered a good approach to dealing with things.

"What, you hate me because I denied access to life-changing drugs for countless impoverished people? Watch this, bitch. I just destroyed ISIS by giving them feelings, since they're no longer amped up on killing powder"
so they're basically zombies

cool, the western world has been wanting to go toe to toe with zombies for a long time now

lets do this
Zombie Syrians OP
I love me some propaganda in the morning. Not only is this article horribly written, but the majority of the sources cited are via Voices of America. You know, the American government's propaganda network. Jesus Christ. 
so does the US Airforce



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarnak_Farm_incident


Funny. I got to take that shit for ADHD when i was a kid. Being a mindless zombie helps in war and in public education.

That sounds like propaganda.
"Hey, how can we tie this terrorism thing into the war on drugs?..I KNOW!"

They did the same thing with Khat in Somalia. Souless murder machines.  Dont forget what dem dirty negroes do when they smoke the weed. Theys get the itchin to rape white folk."

Drugs are used on all sides of battle. Whether its nicotine and alcohol, or pills and lines. Its just propaganda. 
Germans tried this in World War 2. Gave their soldiers meth under brand name Pervitin. It was a complete failure. Soldiers became prone to irrational thoughts, violence against each other and superior officers, reckless behaviour, suicidal tendancies and "crimes involving unnatural sexual acts." LOL
Side effects include "psychosis and brain damage".....No, they already have that...I wanna know what else it does.  Please tell me it is more drastic and infinitely worse
They also infiltrate countries with playstation 4's, gaming forums, masked data in jpegs, cell phones, https, whatsapp, and whatever computation device is capable of preventing data theft. I can't really believe a damn thing I read about what terrorists may or may not be doing, and why everyone should be outraged because of it. The more respected the source, the more retractions seem to happen. Can't cha just tell people they're stroking a white cat?
There's nothing in the Koran against ingesting C^18 H^23 N^5 O^2 .  Hmmm...Reddit doesn't do subscript, I guess.
Wherever the CIAs Dirty Wars have gone, narcotrafficking has been sure to follow:

* Allowing the French Connection to reopen after WWII to fund Mafia and ex-SS strikebreakers in France and Italy

* Controling the Golden Triangle to fund the KMT and Hmong

* Contras smuggling coke for guns and intelligence

* Mujahideen smuggling heroin

You can check Afred W. McCoys book The Politics of Heroin and the PBS Frontline documentary Guns, Drugs, and the CIA
This piece is borderline propaganda.  Giving amphetamines to troops is not new, nor was it only in the past.  US troops are still given modafinil (though technically not an amphetamine) and were given dextroamphetamine  since before Vietnam.  Amphetamines don't enable you to kill people without remorse either.   Fenethylline is metabolised into amphetamine and theophylline which is similar to caffeine.  It's pretty much like mixing adderall and caffeine.  This article is all hype.
So, another group of murderous devout Muslims who rape, kill and use drugs.

Geez, why don't we all convert right now?

Oh, I know:  Because we have bombs, guns and Gitmo.  
"No alcohol or cigarettes because the Koran forbids it. But here, take copious amounts of this little known methy shit!" Air fucking tight logic. Also, will we now have a problem dealing psychotic brain damaged religious zealot terrorists? What other fucked up shit can we fold into this recipe for disaster?
Make you wonder... how do you fight an opponent who is literally crazy?
Or: It's just a stimulant and this is a goofy scare story that should be ignored
"Psychosis and brain damage" doesn't sound like a side effect if you're giving them to Islamic militants. Those are like added bonuses.
Hitler was on meth. We give our own soldiers Amphetamine. This is a common practice in every military, to give the soldiers stimulants. This particular stimulant however may just be the strongest and most effective used, and I had never heard of it. Holy fuck, boys. 

Fuck, dude.
So they would beat them?
They won't have to worry about the brain damage side effect.
First thing I thought of was berserkers.
my friend takes this pill to study for school 
"We would beat them, and they wouldn't feel the pain
I don't recall ever thinking of brain damage as a positive thing.
I think I remember something like this happening in the 20s or 30s for german soldiers.
I think Islamists were showing those symptoms before they enlisted with ISIS
Didn't warlords use the same type of drugs in Sierra Leone and many other controls in africa? I heard about these type of mysterious drugs in the book A Long Way Gone by Ishmael Beah

For those who dont know about it, it is about a story of child soldier who fought in Sierra Leone during their civil war after his couldn't find his parents. It was also about how he had escaped. 



Hezbollah manufacture and sells it and the people they're fighting  consume it. Chechen fighters are famous for being drugged out their minds and going to battle and it started catching on with other rebels in the last few years. 
It's not a random amphetamine, it is amphetamine.
Wasn't this what was found in the saudi prince's plane?
Sounds similar to the X-Files episode I watched yesterday "Sleepless" 
Sounds like every other war, ever.
just like the nazis
The Nazi's were high on meth, every single one of them..how else do you rekt shit? Sober? LOL. No.
Do you want zombies?  Because that's how you create zombies.
Sounds like the Jem'Hadar
They have them on amphetamines and they have us on heroin
Hope they OD on these, turn into zombies and just eat each other up.
Send them more of it. Lots of it.  To both sides.  Let the problem resolve itself.
How many can we flood into our borders? 
Any articles on whether the Paris attackers were using this? 
IIRC during the turmoil in South Africa, there was a story of a rebel out running a military task force in all-terrain vehicles that was chasing him. The soldiers had trouble tracking him because he didn't leave any signs that he rest or ate anything. The only thing they had to go on was the occasional syringe the dogs would find. After 3-4 days of searching they finally gave up. Amphetamines are some freaky shit yo.
Oh god, Hitlers dream army
Suddenly the manhole smiley face is actually jeff the killer.
Sounds about right.
Just like american troops in WW2 or Vietnam taking Dexedrine or as the army called it, the 'go' pill.
Really? Just about every fighter that is not from the civilized world is usually on drugs when they fight. The reason is because combat is stressful and very scary! Only people who fight sober is westerners. 
I wonder if the pills were extra prizes in the crates of ammo and surface to air missiles we sent them. 
How different is this compared to adderall? 
take more-
Similar practices were done during WW1 when soldiers on the western front stayed up for days.

Thanks Dan Carlin*
War...has changed. 
The side effects seem to kick in hard though…
all being supplied by the saudis...go team murica!
Isn't their "religion" against drugs?
&gt;Fenethylline was first synthesized by the German Degussa AG in 1961[3] and used for around 25 years as a milder alternative to amphetamine and related compounds. 

So basically it's a toned down version of adderall. If you take enough adderall and you don't sleep, the same symptoms will occur. 
Fucking Reavers
This reads like a PR piece written to scare US citizens into supporting the never ending combat and the dubious logic behind it.  By the same people that claimed Iraq was going to destroy the planet with WMDs.
Syrian rebels or ISIS?
That sounds like mini-thins you used to get at gas stations in the US some years back. One pack and a cold 2-liter and you had an all night party in your head... But good luck taking a piss for the next 48 hours.
&gt;dangerous side effects, including psychosis and brain damage

But how could anyone tell? It sounds like most of them were already Daesh before they started taking the pill...
Keep up the side effects!
Here's a thought:  flood the market among those who take it with a bastardized version that causes quicker psychosis or liver failure or whatever- over a period short enough to tame the animals but long enough to to not arouse suspicion.  
reminds me of mad max
Nazi's did the same thing 
http://reset.me/video/army-gave-soldiers-lsd-experiment-happened-next-hilarious/    

&gt;But one hour and ten minutes after taking the drug, with one man climbing a tree to feed the birds, the troop commander gave up, admitting that he could no longer control himself or his men. He himself then relapsed into laughter.
This is like the PS3 game Haze.
Have fun with brain damage dumb teenagers snaking over there.
&gt; Side effects include "psychosis and **brain damage**"  
  
How would you be able to tell with Daesh members?
It's tempting but I have decided to keep my talents in America
We should drop hundreds of pounds of that stuff and lace it with poison. Kill all those bastards.  
So Syrian fighters are a bunch of tweakers?! We need to monitor all activity between the hours of midnight and 6 AM. But it does explain how they sleep in such harsh conditions.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7661838

We do it too.
"Brain damage" 
That explains a lot actually 
Don't worry they already have brain damage. 
Lets think about this. Who produces drugs? Asia and turkey. Would there be any military advantage to supply an army, no matter how brutal, to help do your will?  I mean, I honestly didn't know this, but to consider they're all drugged up, speed at that, it all makes sense.  Crazier drugs, crazier fighter. I mean, you can't think our guys weren't fucked up in Vietnam, or elsewhere. Just didn't occur to me until now. (you think religious group, you don't associate drugs, but that's all just bullshit, right? I mean the story is just to grease the tread, get them in the door, then they're yours.I like drugs. But sometimes I fucking hate drugs.
Reasons to get executed: adultery,  witchcraft and sorcery.  

Ok seems coherent with a backwards medieval government.  
I want Saudi Arabia to actually sue these people,... as long as the case will be heard by the honorable Judge Judy, and she dismisses the plaintiff with her trademark spunk, and distaste for pretense.
TIL Saudi Arabia will execute you for 'witchcraft' and 'sorcery'.
Woah. I was following that poet case pretty closely but I didn't know he was Palestinian. 

Where is the public outcry? He's about to be crucified. Maybe some protests the next time a Saudi professor or dance troupe rolls through town? Something? 
[Yes, completely different](https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/punishments_final-01.jpg)
The only real difference is that IS is trying to form a global caliphate and SA is happy to enforce their religious extremist views in the safety of their own little Islamic state. So basically SA is IS without balls.
What?! Saudi Arabia is suing people again for speaking the truth?

I guess I better watch what I say... but Saudi Arabian Royal Family and Government: damn is your justice system ever so similar to ISIS' own system of justice, and seems to be getting worse.

When it comes to pre-trial torturing "confessions" out of prisoners, and violating even the basic rights and tenants of human dignity, including issuing lashings upon rape victims, no one can come near you and ISIS in terms of leading the way. 
Not that I mind, but why did the world suddenly open their eyes to Saudi Arabia? Did something happen?
Can we have a class action counter suit if they do decide to sue anyone? 
Meh, people are missing the point. The Sauds fear criticism online in Saudi Arabia, they couldn't care less what Western users write about Saudi Arabia in English. People mock this lawsuit because it can't shut people up, but it's probably very effective at shutting up liberal Saudi Arabians, which is the point. 

This is what you get Saudi Arabia, you crucified that dude now you have the entire internet armchair activists against you. 
And yet another event that will remain in history as another great example of the Streisand Effect.
How can countries still be so fucking BACKWARDS in the 21st century?? Cutting off someone's head or feet. It's mind boggling. 
I'm sure I read somewhere online that even in Nigeria, a goat was convicted &amp; held as a suspect in a car theft as the man was a sorcerer/used witchcraft &amp; had turned into a goat. Is there any hope?! 
Some people say Saudia Arabia don't be like it is, but it do. #SueMeSaudi
/r/SueMeSaudi
I write you from Jeddah.  Thanks to reddit the Saudi people are waking up.  I give the regime at most 5 years before it is gone.  I thank the brave men of reddit for freeing us!
So brave.
Saudi Arabia = ISIS. PROVE ME WRONG.
Saudi Arabia? Is it some ISIS region ? 
You have been banned from /r/SaudiArabia
And yet another event that will remain in history as another great example of the Streisand Effect.
They just sentenced another woman to death by stone for adultery while the man gets off with 100 lashes. Islam at its finest
http://i.imgur.com/TFMcJY1.jpg
What a backwards society, fuck their politics and feelings. Fuck them.
I can't help but wonder if religion is responsible for more harm than all of those abortions religious people like to point out...
If you have to execute witches and sorcerers to protect your belief, you have no belief. You are crazy. 
You know, as despicable as Saudi Arabia is, it is at least tremendously stable.  As much as I'd love to see the House of Saud fall, the vacuum it would create would be inevitably filled by IS or worse.  

Saudi Arabia is totally fucked, but it is contained and stable.  Let's keep it that way.  Wait till the oil runs out, then let's see what happens.  
I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve by making threats. Did they think this would make people tone down their disdain? "You can't oppress the world Saudi Arabia" We don't play by your rules.   
Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.lol
Taunting Saudi Arabia on Twitter. So #edgy 
First time I read about that ridiculous lawsuit, my first reaction was to start anti-Saudi tweets. SA is bad at social media because it doesn't understand you can't control it outside SA :D
wouldn't #SuediArabia have been better?
IS law system seems like a copy of SA law system. Oh wait...
Wahabi Islam is just terrible.    
I support Raif Badawi!

Guys, it's OK. They have a note from the Bush family.
I just want Saudi students in western universities to stop wearing those stinky leather jackets.
Wait didn't some guy start this on reddit a week or so ago? Correct me if I'm wrong
Just goes to show that on the internet we'd go out of our way to accomplish absolutely nothing.
Saudi Arabia: Because one established ISIS is enough
Also, they have a large empty tent camp that would be perfect for the refugees. Oh, was I not supposed to let people know that? #SueMeSaudi.
without the oil they would just be another 3rd world country nobody gives a fuck about
why on earth were they placed as the head of the un human rights council, they are one of the worst offenders in the world
Saudi citizens can't drink alcohol but it's no big deal for their royalty to do a bunch of  drinking and drugs in Miami? Yeah, nice job Saudi Arabia rulers, fucking morons.
it's all about keeping control over the masses....a lot of people at the top are smart enough to know that religion is stupid and smart enough to pretend it's true to keep control
We should do this but instead of it being Saudi Arabia it's thatagencythatcantseemtominditsownbusiness
How many of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia? Where did the money that supported the 9/11 attacks come from? Which country exports a harsh 7th-century philosophy?

Better repeat my statement from a couple a days ago.
source: https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3ua12m/saudi_arabia_to_sue_twitter_user_who_called_poets/

This is a good start:

I think that Saudi Arabia's execution of the poet Ashraf Fayadh is HIGHLY reminiscent, if not IDENTICAL to the psychotic mentality that drives the terrorist group known as ISIS.

I have NOTHING but contempt and utter disdain for the Saudi Government and the Saudi Royal family for this act.

If the Saudi Government and royal family is offended by this comment, my response is simply to raise my middle finger to your face (and also throw my shoes at you, since that also seems offensive in your culture).

Just in case I was not clear enough: Saudi Government and Saudi Royal family: you TOTALLY SUCK, and are the SAME as ISIS when you commit acts like this, such as executing poets like Ashraf Fayadh.

If you would like to file a formal law suit against me, I WELCOME it. Just PM and I'll give you my contact information. I also fully authorize the admins at Reddit to release my IP address to the Saudi Government upon request.

I fully welcome the challenge of a law suit, and the further media attention I will make sure it brings to your insanity and psychotic ways, and can't wait to see you in court.



They are basically what ISIS would be if ISIS succeeded in building themselves up as a functioning country. I'd welcome their lawsuit. Fuck them.
inb4 SA actually ends up suing every single person and using all their oil money to pay for the best lawyers available.
My son ate all of his vegetables tonight, I'm definitely guilty of sorcery.
I, /u/potato--salad in this document do declare, without libel, that I in my opinion, as protected by Section 2 subsection b of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, feel that the Saudi Arabian justice system is similar in nature to that of the terrorist organization the Islamic State of Irag and Syria (or ISIS, ISIL, IS, etc). 

#SueMeSaudi
fuck saudiarabia and every saudi they're worse than isis
I am happy that finally people are talking about Saudia Arabia and Qatar with regard to terrorism. For years the media didn't really make the connection...
If any Saudi prince or financial minister is reading this,   I will gladly take £1.7m to start a pro Saudi hash tag campaign.   Pm me for details. 
you guys should vote for me so we would not have a giant dickhead for an ally
They are just another bunch of barbarians, only difference is they have money and oil.  The old saying you cant polish a turd but you can throw glitter on it probably applies.
At this rate, Saudia Arabia economy is going to grow to be the wealthiest on earth.
I'm not religious now, but I had my first taste of alcohol (wine) in church. Christians are such hedonists.
Totally random observation, but on that info-graph from middleeasteye.net it specifies "Amputation of right hand" for the Saudis, but only "Amputation of hand" for IS.

So how do the IS guys decide which one to cut off? Is it the dominant Hand? The Hand that was used in the crime? Whatever the judge decides? What if the accused used both hands to steal, are they both amputated? What if it is unclear which hand the purpatrator used? Is there a seperate trial to determine the guilty hand?

So many questions.
This is hilarious.  Fuck your shitty bronze age bullshit.
Dude with the atheist sign has some ginormous cajones
I came here to read about the kid with the clock bomb and middling political career -_-
A twitter campaign - that'll show 'em! Watch out Saudi Arabia!
I once got busy in a Saudi kings bathroom.
It is funny that so many people see this just now. Saudi Arabia is ruled by the 'words of allah' as they interpret it, the rules of 'sharia'. Sharia is the same thing ISIS abides by. You can see other countries which use the same system. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia#/media/File:Use_of_Sharia_by_country.svg 
Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death for "spreading atheism and disrespecting the prophet" in November.

That's totally ISIS like. 
George W. Bush loved the king of Saudi and Saudi loves al Qaeda and ISIS. My friend's friend is my friend.

Is it just me, or is the Saudi justice system the same as ISIS'?
Guys. Maybe just maybe attack mode isn't how solve this. I'm glad we recognize that how they deal with things isn't okay for the 21st century. So let's educate. As much as possible. Not preach hate.
If I remember correctly, I think the original article I read stated that Saudi Arabia would sue any News source comparing S.A. to ISIS.  I could be wrong, but I believe this was in the original article about the poet being beheaded almost 2 weeks ago.
Saudi Arabia, I present you the Streisand effect.
Got to love Saudi Arabia - sentences a man to death for apostasy - abandoning religious practices... but does not want to be compared to the Islamic State...
I bet saudi arabia is trembling with fear, the twitter hashtag army is coming for them.
The US did support ISIS. We left a bunch of weapons and vehicles over in Iraq when we left for like 2 weeks lol. 
Can Saudi Arabia do that? How would that court process work?
Almost makes me want to get a twitter account.


Almost.

Very stupid reasons of being executed: adultery, witchcraft and sorcery
The mother of Daesh 
I'm going to throw out a guess that over 2/3 of America (I can't speak for other countries) don't know the difference between the two. If people can't tell you apart from a terror organization, then I'm guessing you've got some changes to make. 
fuck these Saudi cunts, that is all.
Btw, did that kid ever get crucified, or did we stop that?  Cause if we did I have some feelgooding to do.  And if not then I have some feelsbadding to do. 
There's a saudi 'belief' I've always thought was hilarious. If you leave saudi arabia, god can't see you anymore. So you can do whatever drugs you want and whore it up all you want because, 'god can't see you.'
[Yes, completely different](https://believervsnonbelievers.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/punishments_final-01.jpg)
Stone Age society.
/r/SaudiArabia and /r/Conservative are the exactly same fucking thing lol, it's so cute the these ignorant turds probably hate each other for being different too, regardless of them literally being the same fucking thing.
People are so BADASS on the internet
Fuck Saudi Arabia, how that disgusting regime has lasted this long is truly a testament to how fucked this world is.
I just like that we live in an age where it's so easy to publicly say "Fuck you" directly to a nation's government.
Here we sit and laugh about Saudi Arabia, but it is our own governments that betray us, laugh about us behind our backs.

I am from Germany and while our law is good and in no way barbaric like the Saudis, the way my country treats other countries in the east and africa really makes me sad to my stomach. 

We feel so superior to these countries...everytime these people tweet with #suemesaudi they should also tweet #suemeusa, #suemefrance, #suemegermany etc. and gobble up some truth about our own beloved nations. Because our govs are shit like the saudis and in a way even more evil because i would assume that we, as developed civilizations should know it better. 
Ooooh yea hashtag them! That ought to teach em.
Reddit did too!
Give Saudi Arabia Time .. at least 500 years and it will be good, maybe ...  but probably not,  because they don't have oil
Will they Sue me for submitting this piece here on Reddit? :D
It's a good thing Twitter users don't have any say in foreign policy decisions
I'd join this campaign but Saudi Arabia might actually sue me and everyone knows their "justice" system is just like ISIS.

Not worth the risk.
Fuck Saudi Arabia. 'Nuff said. 
They're doing this to themselves. Step out of the dark ages. Jerk off, let the ladies show some skin, drink a beer. Live a little ya animals.
http://twitter.com/mpopp75/status/670797734987853824/photo/1 fucking brilliant lol, it's like a little rebellious ant in the middle of a pit hole of retarded insects.
Sounds like Saudi-Arabia is just like ISIS...
Such brave keyboard warriors. These are the real heroes and they deserve to be honored
That first cartoon is hypocritical being spread by Americans. We could just as easily be in that line up with a needle and/or power wires. There is no non-barbaric form of execution. If you are going to condone it's use at least make it public and horrific to make it a real deterrent.
Fellow Americans, did it ever occur to you that now is not the time or place to make enemies wherever there is injustice? Have you just gone insane and decided that your sentiments won't help extremists recruit moderates. Have you never heard of the Prime Directive? This isn't your girlfriend's abusive stepmom, this is international relations. Show some situational awareness. 
I don't understand how people didn't realize this sooner. Most, if not a majority of the middle east, is beyond fucked up and their traditions are borderline medieval. I'm all for freedom of speech, religion, equality, etc. etc. blah blah but how can you still justify cutting off hands, crusifiction, and stoning to death purely based off of tradition and religion? There are better ways to give incentive to stop these things from happening than penalty of violent death or amputation.
Hooray! This will be just like 2012 when we got that Kony guy elected.
I am *so* happy that this is catching on and real public outcry is occurring.  This is the type of thing that is absolutely needed to fight these groups.  We will never "defeat" this type of ideology without reform from our major allies.  
lol this is not world news
Serious suggestion. Randomise these laws and events, remove all mention of whether the perpetrator was ISIL or Saudi Arabia, and see if your friends can spot which one is which.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Saudi_Arabia

I sure can't! So sue me too! I'm sure some Saudi princes could use the money to buy one or two extra slaves for their harems.
I swear to God I rather live in a war devasted area than live in Saudi Arabia! You people do not consider that this single-family-owned country has one of the highest slavery, discrimination and racism rates in the World! Discrimination against women and discrimination based on the origin of the Saudis themselves, racism against any other foreigner, especially if he's from the third-World or an emerging country...
And don't get me started on the complete lack of elementary rights, like freedom of speach...
This is what happens when a country bases their laws on a bronze age book. 
Saudi Arabia be like: Remember 9/11? trollface.jpg
Speaking of capital punishment, let's have a look at the U.S. penitentiary system, shall we?
It's weird because couple o' weeks ago I had this strange dream where people were preaching solidarity to anyone who would listen.
They couldn't care less, this is minor
I never thought I'd find something in /r/worldnews worthy of x-posting in /r/popping, but that blackhead cluster is just epic.
shit, look at the eye crust on that guy
Honestly even if I find this internet initiative great, I will advise to the West buying oil from KSA, for some reason.
Man these folks are really tempting fate by taunting ISIS like that.
It was done in the middle east, especially in SA.
ISIS = Carnisim.
Yeah This is thing in many countries.
Bunch of motherfucking ISIS fucks. Sue me bitch.
---E
How useless.
People are only doing this because they have money. If this was some poor country, no one would care. 
Let me guess, when these people end up dead, it will be blamed on ISIS?
So cruel laws...and they are wondering why people compare them to ISIS...
It's fun how these guys are saying this but is not living in Saudi Arabia. 
Kind of interested in the chart with the punishment for breaking laws. Does it work? Is there less theft in Saudi Arabia? Do less people cheat on their loved ones? Less substance abuse?

I'd honestly rather have 80 lashes for doing drugs (it may seem absurd since it's alcohol, but we still have a less harmful drug as illegal in most areas) than prison time like in the United States.
How brave of them.
My instant reaction was this trend was started by 4chan .-.

This is what happens when religion has a strong influence on government/royal family. Europe went through this a while back, same thing is happening here. People forget that they were all savages not too long ago until oil and stuff.
How is this news?
Both the Saudis and isis are very religious muslim groups, but if a connection is made to Islam your framed as islamaphobic. #Wakeup.

*****
&gt; Comparing Saudi Arabia to terror group &amp;quot;Islamic State&amp;quot; had already become more common ever since Palestinian poet Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death for &amp;quot;Spreading atheism and disrespecting the prophet&amp;quot; in November.

&gt; Another image that&amp;#039;s being tweeted and retweeted is this political cartoon from Peter Brookes, which graphically depicts the similarities in capital punishment exercised by IS and Saudi Arabia.

&gt; Generally, there are known parallels between the &amp;quot;Islamic State&amp;quot; terror group and the state religion of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Wahhabism, a radical-conservative interpretation of Sunni-Islam.

Wow! The rulers of Saudi Arabia must be so upset by this. Great job!
Just remember, this could be considered "hate speech" by certain first world countries that legislate protecting people's feelings.
Oh Saudi Arabia... has Barbara taught you nothing?
Boy, you sure are showing them evil arabians what's what! And without having to wear pants even!
Freedom of religion means an unalienable human right to apostasy.
How come humans right and other world organisations do anything about this retrograde bullshit? I mean, can't someone tell them to stop that? At some point this shouldn't be considered as a punishment but a torture which is against most conventions
I was entertained reading those tweets.

I've always found some of Mexico's laws and rights very interesting.  For example you can't get charged for breaking out of jail or prison.  They recognize that it is part of human nature to want to be free and it is wrong for punishing human nature.

Edit: I'm getting a lot of replies about some similar comment yesterday.  I never saw it and I'm not trying to rip it off.  This is something I learned years ago.  Believe me or not, thats your choice.  But thats the honest truth.
It's kinda weird that the entire Western world just suddenly decided that pot is OK now.
This whole marijuana legalization movement is really kicking in to overdrive. Justin Trudeau being sworn in, UN calling to decriminalize all drugs, Ireland deciding that was a good idea, and now this.. 

Awesome.
I'm not sure I'd agree that *smoking pot* is a fundamental right. I'd argue that *liberty* is a fundamental right, and making it illegal to smoke pot infringes upon that right.
It's *kinda* bullshit, only 4 people are allowed for now, but if more and more people seek refuge from the law that just good deemed inconstitutional, it can become fully legalized.


No, what they recognized is the fundamental right to choose.
Mexico has always been good to tourists :)

&gt;"It's really a monumental case," said Hannah Hetzer of the Drug Policy Alliance, a drug reform advocacy group, in an interview. "It was argued on human rights grounds, which is unusual, and it's taking place in Mexico, the epicenter of some of the worst effects of the war on drugs."

To me, that very sentence shows why it isn't unusual for Mexico to argue from a human rights perspective.  The worldwide war on drugs has surrounded Mexico in such a violent way and I think it's completely fair to argue for human rights here.
We'll soon view "freedom to take mind altering substances" in the same light as "freedom of religion". Anything to the contrary will seem absurd and oppressive. 
Why does reddit understand "fundamental human right" to mean that you're allowed to do something without being thrown in jail... until it comes to healthcare, at which point the meaning changes to "this thing should be provided for everyone through taxes"?
"As long as you're not harming other people, you have the right to autonomy."

That is the tough part.  One could argue the same thing about meth.  But at some point, meth users negatively affect others around them, their communities, etc.  Defining what "harms" other people is difficult. 
Prohibition doesn't work. It never has, never will and will always lead to more suffering.

Right on man.
I always suspected Mexico would eventually be a better country to live in than the US. This is the type of progressive thought that builds great nations. It took the 18th amendment to take alcohol away and yet the 21st amendment to legalize alcohol. If any one is wondering why before Reagan the legal age of drinking was eighteen, you have Nancy Reagan and her MADD campaign to make the age of legal drinking to be 21. Coincidence? Nope, just arbitrary politics plus banning smoking in Government buildings, withholding federal roadwork funds and firing striking FAA watch tower operators. BLUF- I watched the legal drinking age change due to panic politics and the War on Drugs. Let's see if the US as a whole will reconsider their opinion on legal marijuana use after Canada and Mexico legalize use of a plant that is not tobacco.

Pack up kids we're moving to Mexico!
I feel like we're getting closer
Viva la Marijuana! lol
Mexico: You have the right to get stoned.

Saudi Arabia: We have the right to have you stoned.
I should be able to ingest anything I want, unless free health care is involved. If I brake the law due to being intoxicated, throw the book at me. 


As an example, Fuck anyone saying smoking weed while nature walking is illegal. I'm not hurting anyone. Drunk or high driving deserves punishment.

Hmmm. What's the Feds going to do when both Canada and Mexico stop this antiquated bullshit and legalize?? Haha. Go Mexico! Go Canada!! 
In the United States, the freedom and right to consume cannabis is implicit under the Ninth and Tenth Amendment. The Drug War is an Unconstitutional and thus Illegal war. If anyone belongs in prison for anything, it is the DEA agents who have killed, kidnapped, robbed, and trespassed the homes of innocent pot smokers.

That said, cannabis should be vaporized, or consumed via edibles, oils, juices, waxes - they are far healthier delivery methods.
Life, liberty, and the pursuit of straight dank yo.
should have ruled that government doesn't have the right to interfere with smoking pot. there is a rather significant difference.
All politics and personal opinions aside, I don't care about pot one way or another. It's just not my thing. I think it's stupid to make it illegal but I also think calling it a fundamental human right is absurd. But it's Mexico and their Government is  basically a bad episode of a reality show.
So now the cartels are providing oppressed U.S. citizens and illegal aliens from Mexico with a protected product. Enforcement against this product can allow Mexico to ask the U.N. to place humanitarian sanctions on the U.S for violating the rights of Mexican citizens...lol.
Yay, awesome!

&gt; While the ruling does not mean that marijuana is now legal in the country — it only applies to the four plaintiffs in this specific case

Oh...
It's amazing to me that mexico hasn't made all drugs legal in an attempt to stop the massive amount of crime they have there. I am not saying drugs aren't bad it just seems like they might be better then having a huge gang problem.
A human being should be able to do whatever he/she/it wants as long as he/she/it doesn't cause harm to anyone else but themselves.


Currently one of the opposing political parties is promoting 32 "amparos" to accelerate the jurisprudence and change the law, also this jurisprudence would help to people already detained for its use to be released, and also the Secretary of Finance and Public Credit in Mexico stated that any pot regularization would include a taxation so I really think this is going to happen eventually.

[Link in spanish tough](http://www.cnnmexico.com/adnpolitico/2015/11/06/el-prd-quiere-colgarse-la-medalla-de-la-despenalizacion-de-la-marihuana)
ITT a shitload of gringos not reading the article.
No ill will to OP since that's the title of the article itself, but goddamn if that isn't the most massive click-bait title.

Actual ruling: prohibition of marijuana possession and consumption violates "right to free development of one's personality" which the article equates to "right of self-determination".
This will probably make cartels a little miffed. 
"The state can't prevent you from say, eating junk lots of junk food, even if it's not great for your health. As long as you're not harming other people, you have the right to autonomy. And in this instance, the Supreme Court ruled that possessing and consuming marijuana falls under this category." - Article
well it is
Damn straight!
end the drug war.  
close the prisons.  
stop using punishment for anything, switch to socially helpful and dignified humane treatment.  
Lol fundamental human right is a lil much that got me good.
It also motivates and enhances your creativity. It even cured my ovarian cancer, and I don't even have ovaries. When u commune wit de erb u be in toch wit gaia.
"Fundamental human right," is a phrase that seems to get tossed around a lot lately.  It's like the words don't mean anything.  Why can't they just say, "this is now legal," instead of making up this bullshit about it being a fundamental human right.
No word yet on keeping your head attached to body
That's outstanding. Good for them.
I realized how fucking ridiculous a lot of laws are after seeing the film Gandhi.  At one point in the film, Gandhi walks to the sea to make salt, in defiance of the British law that made it illegal for Indians to make salt from the ocean.

Think about that law for a second.  Really think about it.  Think about how oceans are naturally salty, and how water just evaporates on its own.  Think about how if ocean water gathers in a basin and then is allowed to evaporate it leaves behind salt, naturally, without any human interaction.  And then think about how if you happened to be walking along the beach and reached down to pick up some of this salt the British would have beaten you senseless and arrested you.  For picking up salt.  Off the fucking ground.

And that's what prohibition is.  It's banning a plant.  A natural plant that grows outdoors, by itself, with minimal human interaction.  And if you happened to pick it up off the ground you get thrown in prison.  

Arbitrary, man made rules against natural processes.  It's would be just as ridiculous as banning erosion.
It shouldn't be.  It should be legal but it shouldn't be a human right.  As a non smoker I wouldn't want anyone to practice their smoking (anything)  habits around me.  Fresh air should be a human right.  
The majority of people that think this is a bad idea have probably never experienced anything to do with it. The fact that doctors are restricted in how they're able to conduct research on marijuana is dissapointing. Allow them to conduct proper research and if the benefits out weigh the negatives, then legalize it. In the long run the amount of revenue that would be gained from legalizing it, would greatly out weigh the revenue gained for arresting people for it.

Edit: a word.
I'm all for marijuana legalization, but it's far froma "human right." The case for legalization is that it's impossible to stop people from smoking marijuana and the costs of trying far outweigh the benefits considering its very limited potential harm.
This kind of thing I'd expect in nottheonion.
Has anyone heard of any committee or council of doctors/researchers/anybody trying to get this recognized the same way in Canada? I read something a while back about it but I'm not sure if it was just a reddit comment or a bonafide article. 

Wondering because a lot of the industrial corporations in Canada will be using their own policy on drugs even when we do get recreational pot so it's a choice between that and a well paying job :/ I like to toke with friends and it's also a nice way to relax after the gym so I find it unfair that their policy would allow them to dictate what I do in my off time.
Eh... I think people should have the freedom to smoke pot if they so choose but *smoking pot itself being a fundamental human right*?  I kind of have an issue with the way they're stating this.
Legal sure. A human right? Wat.
Dear Governments of the World,

The drug war is over. You have lost. Drugs are easy to get for anyone who wants them. Kindly repeal the laws against drug use and possession and direct our law enforcement resources in a more useful manner.

Sincerely,

How is this not in /r/notheonion? I realize reddit is very serious about its weed, but "fundamental human right" is way too far out there.
I think marijuana should be legal but saying it's a "fundamental human right" is kinda ridiculous.
A fundamental human right? I mean, it's smoking pot. I mean, yeah, it should not be illegal, but a fundamental human right?
Yeah, because it's half of their GDP.
The cartels cannot be happy.

I, for one, welcome this ruling with open arms and would hope the United States enacts the exact same law. 
Would that mean that smoking tobacco is a fundamental human right?
[Meanwhile in the UK](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/105708?reveal_response=yes)

tldr - Marijuana should continue to be classed as a drug that has the highest harm rating (Schedule 1) because "Cannabis in its raw form (herbal cannabis) is not recognised as having any medicinal purposes in the UK." (no sources or evidence supplied to support this claim btw)
I'm going to be deeply disappointed if Canada **and** Mexico legalize before the US does (federally).
I saw this on Facebook yesterday, I was wondering when reddit would catch up.
Of course the Mexicans would say that. 
wow......
Zihuatanejo. 
It has become a very confusing issue in Mexico, the only legal use is for 4 individuals that fought their case, it is an important step for future legislations but as of right now, only 4 individuals are free to smoke weed.
Sounds like they'll be building the wall now. 
Fuckin' A.

to be fair, mexico is run by drug cartels. i'm sure every elected official there has beheaded, raped, and murdered someone.

Not sure that I agree with the reasoning for them finding it a fundamental human right, BUT every individual should have full ownership of their own body and what does or does not go in it.

The "human right" term has lost all it's meaning. Soon it will be a human right to smoke weed and play Xbox. 
I think it should be mandatory. the world would actually be a better place.
Viva la mexico!
BLOWN THE FUCK OUT
I feel like the supreme court in Mexico was like "You know what Trump, we're gonna give you a reason to call us drug dealers now"
Also ending the war on drugs is common sense.
¡Viva Mexamerica! 
I dont get why this is so hot trend, even chilean supreme courts did the same not so long ago and that doesn't change anything about how the law is being implemented by the cops and lawyers....

I can't believe they'd use Spanish words to spell an English acronym.
I guess the cartels are really doing good with heroin to let this happen.
I'm definitely pro-legalization, but a human right? Lol
I don't think "fundamental" is the correct word. Like, at all.

I don't think the right to smoke pot is as primordial as the right to life or freedom of speech. Maybe it's a right, just not "fundamental". Correct me if I'm wrong.
something something pursuit of happiness...
dont forgot the inalienable human right of drinking coronas and throwing the bottles wherever you want!

Viva Mexico Cabrones!
This is amazing news!   For so many years of prosecuting and destroying people over a commonly used plant that is important to many cultures and people.  There is finally beginning to be open political recognition of a human right to choose over ones own body when it comes to using pot.  Things will change around the world regarding the war on personal freedom over the coming years and this is an important catalyst to be celebrated.
Honestly the first thing I thought: "Mexico has a supreme court?"
"...right to use marijuana as a fundamental human right."
That's got a nice ring to it! 
&gt;Fundamental

Okay Mexico that's great we're legalizing weed, but let's slow down lol.

Marijuana is not a fundamental human right, but all humans have the fundamental human right to elect what they put in their own bodies. It does not matter if it is marijuana, heroin or Mc nuggets, the goverment has no right to put someone in jail for what they do to their own bodies. 
I don't agree it's a fundamental right more so than I believe legislating against it simply makes no sense and creates a situation where human nature is compelled to break a law that really protects no one in the first place.

As crazy as Dennis Miller got later in life, I've always found this piece of his rant on prohibition to be incredibly accurate and insightful:

*"Now,
I'm not pro-drug, they obviously cause a lot of damage, but I am
pro-logic and you're never going to stop the human need for release
through altered consciousness. The government can take away all the
drugs in the world and people will just spin around on their lawn until
they fell down and saw God."*
neat

Thanks Mexico! May you grow nice buds and may your ladies always be sexy!
I'd say pot should be legal, but a fundamental human right? What are they smoking.
According to my psychiatrist, it's the worst thing in the world. 
Damn straight, mis compas
What does that mean? For the last few days the Mexican instances have been officially saying a great deal of good things about pot but is that actually changing laws are is it just op-eds they do?
Same in Germany. But good luck breaking out of jail without breaking any other laws. Even just taking your jail clothing you are wearing with you is already theft.

redditors cannot into law
Now that's more like it!
Heyooooo :)
I had a very conservative Christian friend who smoked pot. When asked about it he would say that God gave Adam and Eve permission to have anything within the garden of Eden except for the forbidden fruit. Hence, in his defense, smoking pot is ok by God's book but anything synthetic made from a lab isn't.

Always thought it was funny and clever.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
i think this is terrible.
This has been my opinion for years!
That's an amazing, and true, statement which you don't hear often; sad to read that it's only applying to four people. 
You have the right to remain stoned. Anything you smoke cannot be held against you in a court of law. You have the right to weed. If you do not have a weed dealer present, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand your right to fail a drug test?
[deleted]
Why just pot?  Why not make it a fundamental human right to put whatever I want into my own body, assuming I am acting responsibly in every other way.
I can't wait until the USA recognizes the same thing. 
So under that logic is doing heroin a human right also? Should that be legalized and legitimized so that people don't need to steal and commit crimes to feed their addictions? 
It's a right not a privilege.  That should be part of prison life, to keep them from getting out of control.
It's stupid legislation at best.
I can understand something like a basic level of housing for the homeless.
who are those courts to list me my rights?

ah yes, monopoly on violence.

*****
&gt; Mexico&amp;#039;s Supreme Court ruled 4-to-1 Wednesday that outlawing the possession and use of the marijuana plant represents a violation of fundamental human rights.

&gt; While the ruling does not mean that marijuana is now legal in the country - it only applies to the four plaintiffs in this specific case - it gives a tremendous amount of political space for lawmakers to introduce marijuana reform bills at the state and federal level in Mexico.

&gt; Given marijuana developments in the United States and now Mexico, many drug policy experts say the U.N. must change the treaties if it is to maintain legitimacy.

Turkey saying its airspace was violated and Russia saying it wasn't. One of them is sure lying or using Apple Maps.
Reports are now surfacing that a search and rescue helicopter was also shot down by rebels using a TOW missile. Holy shit.
Putin speaks.

source (http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/24/russian-jet-downed-by-turkish-planes-near-syrian-border-live-updates?CMP=twt_gu):

This event is beyond the normal framework of fighting against terrorism. Of course our military is doing heroic work against terrorism... But the loss today is a stab in the back, carried out by the accomplices of terrorists. I can’t describe it in any other way. Our aircraft was downed over the territory of Syria, using air-to-air missile from a Turkish F-16. It fell on the Syrian territory 4km from Turkey.
 
Neither our pilots nor our jet threatened the territory of Turkey. This is obvious. They are fighting terrorists in the northern areas around Latakia, where militants are located, mainly people who originated in Russia, and they were pursuing their direct duty, to make sure these people do not return to Russia. These are people who are clearly international terrorists.
 
Taking into account that we signed an agreement on deconflicting with the US, and as we know Turkey was among the ones that has joined the US coalition. Since Isis has such huge resources of hundreds of millions and billions of dollars coming from illicit oil sales, and they are protected by the armed forces of other states, then it’s clear why they are so brazen, why they are killing people, why they are carrying out terrorist attacks throughout the world including in the heart of Europe.
 
We will analyse everything, and today’s tragic event will have significant consequences, including for Russia-Turkish relations. We have always treated Turkey as a friendly state. I don’t know who was interested in what happened today, certainly not us. And instead of immediately getting in contact with us, as far as we know, the Turkish side immediately turned to their partners from Nato to discuss this incident, as if we shot down their plane and not they ours.

'Hi is that NATO HQ?.... It's Turkey here and we just shot down a Russian fighter jet' &lt;Silence&gt;
~~Some Turkish news sources say that it was a MIG-23.~~ 

~~**EDIT:** Further comment on the same website~~:

~~"Military officials who commented on the plane underlined the fact that the plane was a MIG-23 which is used by Syrian Air Forces. Military officials claimed that the plane which violated Turkish airspace was shot down by Turkish F-16s." http://www.sabah.com.tr/dunya/2015/11/24/suriye-sinirinda-ucak-dustu~~ 

Another Turkish news website claims that it was a Russian plane. The same website also claims that the Russian forces near the region were mobilized immediately to rescue the pilots who managed to jump off with parachutes. [link](http://www.haberturk.com/dunya/haber/1157674-suriye-sinirinda-ucak-dustu) 

All the Turkish news sources have one thing in common which is that only recently Turkish MFA summoned the Russian ambassador and warned him that if Russian planes violate Turkish airspace, Turkey will follow its rules of engagement.

**EDIT2:** Now Hürriyet says that a source from President's office said that the plane was a Su-24. [link](http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumhurbaskanligi-rus-ucagi-dusuruldu-40017980)


**EDIT3:** Now all news sources are confirming that indeed President's office told the press that the plane was SU-24. PM Davutoglu asked Turkish MFA to inform UN and NATO.

**EDIT4:** First reaction by Russia. Russian MFA claimed that the plane never violated Turkish airspace and they are ready to provide proof. This also confirms that it was a Russian plane. (This was reported by İnterfaks)

Tupungato adds: 

&gt; The Russian Defense Ministry said the downed plane was a Russian Su-24. It said it can prove the aircraft was over Syria during its entire flight. This is while the Turkish military said the plane was warned “ten times” before it was shot down.

&gt; On 24th of November around 9.20 am near Hatay Yayladağı region, a plane, nationality unknown, violated the Turkish airspace despite having been warned 10 times over a period of 5 minutes. The aforementioned plane was intercepted at 9.24 by 2 Turkish F-16s which were patrolling the area. 

**EDIT6:** Turkish military shared the radar images which shows the plane's route. It is in Turkish but you'll get the idea:  [link](http://i.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/770x0/5654392d0f254432e87530f1)

The turquoise line is the Turkish border. 

The red line is Russian plane's flight path. 

The yellow arrow on the right is where the Russian plane entered Turkish airspace. 

The yellow arrow on the left is where it exited the Turkish airspace. 

The green rectangle is I suppose where the plane was hit by the missile.

**EDIT 7:** Sozcu, a Turkish news outlet, is now reporting that the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov cancelled his visit to Turkey which was planned for tomorrow.

Turkish media is also reporting that one of the pilots is dead and the other one is captured by Turkmen rebel forces in Syria.

**EDIT 8:** Apparently right after the plane was shot a Russian warship crossed the straits and headed towards the Mediterranean. Even though Turkish media reports this as an indication of Russian mobilization, it is also very likely that this was a planned trip.

**EDIT9:** NATO will hold an emergency meeting at 18.00 by the request of Turkey.
Syrian rebels aligned with Turkey have captured one Russian pilot and are currently searching for the other.
Also note that Russia has publicly said that the ISIS oil truck flow headed towards Turkey.




This won't blow up into something huge...after seeing a innocent passenger jet be blown up via BUK missile and half of Ukraine (see Crimea) invaded on the sly, I doubt one jet would escalate any further than aggressive politician rhetoric. This isn't WW3, it will be a case of pointing the finger until the next incident happens in this proxy war. 

Edit - to save my inbox, clearly British Sarcasm isn't conveyed well via my comment. I have kept behind the Ukraine situation since the start and appreciate that it's not half a country that's been invaded, but my point stands that Russian aggression has ultimately caused incidents before to which we've yet to see any military repercussions from the international community. Economic sanctions aside, I'm saying that this will not cause WW3 and it's not the first time reddit's cried out for it after an incident like this. 
BREAKING: Russian media confirm that plane shot down by Turkish air force is Russian.

Uh oh
Turkey extended it's airspace in 2012 5 miles out into Syrian airspace, with the approval of NATO. I'm guessing this has something to do with it.
From BBC:
&gt;Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the incident as "very serious", but cautioned that it was too early to draw conclusions.

At least gotta hand it to them for their very measured response.


The event is not without precedent: 

In [2012 a Turkish military aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2012_interception_of_Turkish_aircraft) went into Syria's airspace and it was shot down by Syrian forces. At the time Turkish president Abdullah Gül said, "it is routine for jet fighters to sometimes fly in and out over [national] borders."

We'll see how the story changes now that the shoe is on the other foot.

**edit**: Also in 2012 [Prime Minister Erdogan said](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18598529), regarding the downing of their F-4 Phantom, "A short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack."
[Footage of the plane going down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aryCZEKIlgs)

Reports coming in that the pilot captured by the rebels is also dead.

"A short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack" Mr. Erdogan told us back in 2012 when a Turkish jet was shot down by Syria.
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18598529
this is the radar trace of the incident, shared by turkish military
http://i.hurimg.com/i/hurriyet/75/770x0/5654392d0f254432e87530f1

People need to calm down. First off, this is a very early report, and the entire story is not known at this point. WW3 is not starting because of this. No world superpower is going to war over a downed fighter jet - not in this day and age. Now, if the facts come out that the Russian jet was indeed in turkish territory, Russia will spew alot of harsh rhetoric Turkey's way, and those two countries will likely never like each other moving forward. However, international support for Russia in that situation will be somewhere between sparse and non-existent. If Turkey shot down a Russian jet in Syrian territory, then the narrative changes. Turkey will likely be condemned by the international community and a formal apology will likely be expected. The rest of NATO likely would put pressure on Turkey, knowing that the Turks dont really have a good argument. 

But again, let's get some more information before everyone starts predicting WW3.
Shot the pilots as they descended, horrible.

["A short-term border violation can never be a pretext for an attack," he said.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-18598529) Erdogan in 2012 after Turkey F4 was downed in Syria.
Aircraft in question likely an SU-24MR E or F model Reconnaissance aircraft.

The Su-24MR Fencer-E is a tactical reconnaissance aircraft that can be identified by its dielectic panels in a slightly shortened nose. The basic reconnaissance package is the BKR-1 Bortovoy Kompleks Razvedki (Onboard Reconnaissance Complex) which incorporates the Shtyk (Bayonet) SLAR and a Zima (Winter) imaging infrared reconnaissance system in the nose. In addition, the aircraft frequently carries various combinations of the Aist-M (Stork) TV reconnaissance pack, the AP-402 and A-100 'wet-film cameras, the Ehfir-1M (Ether) radiation monitoring system, the Shpil'-2M (Steeple) laser line-scan unit and the Tangazh (Pitch) ELINT system in external pods. Using an on-board wide-band radio channel the aircraft can transmit data from some sensors in near real time to dedicated ground stations. In addition, the camera pods can also develop film in-flight, which can then be dropped inside a special canister to a ground based command post or mobile Reconnaissance Intelligence Cell (RIC). Around 100 aircraft are currently in service with Russia, how many of the exported Fencers remain serviceable is very debatable, but probably only a handful in each country at any one time.


The Su-24MP Fencer-F was designed as a dedicated ECM aircraft, which can also gather ELINT and SIGINT. The aircraft is very similar in appearance to the Fencer-E but can be distinguished by a prominent undernose fairing and a number of swept-back 'hockey stick' antennas mounted near the intakes. Only around 20 aircraft were built and the majority remain in service.

http://www.16va.be/3.4_la_reco_part3_eng.html

If its an E then Russia was looking for timely information on conditions near the border, which
would suggest a buildup of some kind- or Russia believing there to be and banking on NATO's weak resolve to ignore their flights.

The less likely F model in this case because ELINT and SIGINT can just as easily be sampled on the Syrian side of the border at range. Repeated border penetration reports means they weren't straying accidentally.

Flight radar track on downed warplane issued by Turkish military: https://twitter.com/CNNTURK_ENG/status/669098577524822016
Looks like the downed helicopter [was on the ground, stationary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IschF-ihjS0) when it got shot.
Such is the fate of a soldier. A Life, but simply a pawn in the power play of politics. RIP.
Let's take a look at the background to this.

In 2012, a Turkish jet was shot down by Syrian forces near to the border. As a result Turkey stated that any border incursions would be met with force.

Since then multiple Syrian aircraft have been shot down for entering Turkish airspace.

Russian aircraft have also been violating Turkish airspace, but Turkey has responded to these incidents diplomatically as annoying Russia is generally a bad idea. Following the most recent incident the Russians were warned that further incursions would be met with force.

Recently, a Russian drone was shot down in Turkey, and Turkey downplayed it and refused to acknowledge the origin of the drone in order to defuse tensions.

Russia has been using its aircraft to attack Syrian Turkmen, a group strongly supported by Turkey.

Today, a Russian military aircraft, whilst conducting bombing runs on Turkish backed groups in Syria, flew close to Turkish airspace and was warned away at both 13km and 5km.

The aircraft was not acknowledging the warnings, declaring an emergency, or changing course.

The aircraft chose to overfly Turkish territory and was subsequently fired on by the Turkish military.

The response by Turkey is in no way a surprise given the repeated warnings given to Russia.

Many comparisons are being drawn to other NATO countries responses to Russian incursions, however taking the UK as an example, none of these have been within the 12nm territorial UK airspace, they have been incursions into controlled airspace (a safety issue for civilian aircraft) As a result it is unsurprising that they have not been met with force. Moreover, when a Russian submarine was suspected to be in Finnish waters recently, their Navy dropped depth charges on it, which is a similar aggressive action.
I'm hearing a lot of "it crashed I Syria which means it was not in Turkish airspace."

This should be kind of obvious but you guys realize that a plane being shot down isn't going to fly straight down without any deviation right?
I can see the headline now: Turkey fights back at Thanksgiving!
It seems as this happened around Hatay Province which [Turkey and Syria seem to be in dispute over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatay_province#Turkish.E2.80.93Syrian_dispute).  Russia recognizes it as Syrian territory and I believe Lavrov had informed the Turks of this the previous time something similar happened (although I'm having trouble finding a source for this [here is some old info on the Soviet stance](http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000256977.pdf) [pdf]).

I  srsly doubt Russia will take military action over that incident.  
They will most likely fill a complaint at the UN and NATO and that is about it.  
They will condemn the action and then return to business as usual.  
Edit: there are reports of heavy firefights between the rescue crew and other forces. I really hope it is rebels and not the Turkish army, otherwise my statement above might be invalid really soon
That video of the rebels blowing up the rescue helicopter is using an american supplied missile launcher.... Fuck sake this is going to get bad 
Live Thread [here] (https://www.reddit.com/live/vyzlz8zoke7a/) for those interested.

 
While Turkey might have the right to shoot at unauthorised warplanes over it's country, given the radar data image and the brief overflying of a border area, it seems like a pretty dangerous game to start playing. Things could get a whole lot more messy here.
Shooting the pilot as he's parachuting down is just gratuitously barbaric.
Looks like us Americans won't be the only ones grilling turkey this week.

Is it true that NATO ambassadors have been called to meet at Brussels?
There is an international rule and agreement about airspace.

If you violate a country's airspace, you get warned. If you still do it, you get warned again. And again. If you're still doing it, and you happen on top of it to be a warplane, then you get shot down. You're Hitler? you get shot down. You're Mother Teresa? you still get shot down.

It's that simple. Russia was well aware of what it was doing.

Now shooting the pilots...well that's on par with the state of the whole fucking region.


On a side note these rebels for who ammos don't seem to be a problem, are not Syrian but Turkmens, from Turkmenistan.

Erdgon is pissed off that Russia is bombing his ISIS allies.
Nothing will happen out of this. This is not something that Turkey or Russia wants. 
Everyone needs to calm down. There's so much hysteria going on in these threads.

First of all, a violation of somebody's airspace is absolutely a legal reason to shoot down someone. In fact, in 2012, [Turkey had an F-4 Phantom shot down by Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2012_interception_of_Turkish_aircraft) when it cut across Syrian airspace - two Turkish aircrew were killed.

Since then, Turkey has shot down Syrian aircraft that have violated its airspace.

In fact, nearly two months ago, Turkey and NATO warned [Russia not to violate Turkish airspace](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/turkey-warns-russia-over-airspace-violations-as-syria-airstrikes-widen/2015/10/05/19d2e7b0-6b47-11e5-b31c-d80d62b53e28_story.html)

Now, as for this particular incident, the map that [Turkey released](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUkaVc4WsAA0SQL.png) shows the Su-24 flying a typical pattern for aircraft doing close air support/bombing missions. They're flying a holding pattern to conserve fuel while targets are either designated or found, so it is flying no where near Mach 1 or any airspeed. The actual speed is probably closer to 200 knots or thereabouts, so closer to 30 seconds of time was spent each time it went through Turkish airspace.

In addition, it appears that the Russian airplane flew THROUGH Turkish airspace on its first entry orbit before entering a left hand pattern and then re-entered Turkish airspace again, whereupon it was shot down by Turkey. If indeed it was warned multiple times not to re-enter, and it did it again, then it was shot down as Turkey and NATO had warned would happen.

Video allegedly shows dead Russian pilot surrounded by armed rebels in Syria (GRAPHIC)

https://www.rt.com/news/323237-video-dead-russian-pilot/
This is what happens when you've got too many cooks in the kitchen. Russia, the US, and the Euros all need to stop swinging their manhood and decide on a single strategy. 
Latakia - an intensified conflict zone in Northern Syria and currently the stronghold of Assad - is about 60km (~37 miles) from the Turkish border.

Straddling the Turkey-Syria border is Jebel Aqra - the al-Aqra region has been used by insurgents in Syria due to mountain cover and has been a site of numerous Russian airstrikes.

This has been a long time coming - but it goes to show one of the major problems with the Syria campaign; NATO can't decide who the baddies are.

And while we're told that Assad is one of the baddies (which is totally up to the people of Syria to decide and not the job of any other nation to impose upon them), consolidating Northern Syria even under the rule of Assad would do more to stop ISIS than letting the region fall to chaos. 

Turkey has every right to defend its sovereign borders, but knowing that the incursion (if it even happened, due to the confusion of border warfare) was only conducted in the pursuit of insurgents (unconfirmed as of yet, but al-Nusra [former 'moderate' al-Qaeda affiliates now considered full-blown terries] are most likely given they have been the target of Russia's Northern-Syria offensive) should have led them to deal with the infraction with more caution. 

This disunity will prevent any real progress in Syria and only exaggerate tensions between Moscow and the West. Russia is best equipped regionally to address the threat - they've a large network of regional alliances working both on the ground and in intelligence, a far more effective infrastructure of counter-terrorist resistance than NATO's airpower alone. 

NATO needs to accept that and come to terms with the fact that its dreams of an Assad-free Syria (whether that be a good or bad thing) cannot begin to be a reality until ISIS is on the retreat. 


AKP government has been promoting those terrorist claiming them to be Turkmens in the region. They have been heavily supporting them in terms of finance and weapons both in and out of Turkey. Those in the videos, who are claimed to be of Turkish origins by the AKP government beforehand, cannot even speak Turkish. They are parts of El Kaide (El Nusra etc). As a Turkish citizen who witnesses the manipulation through the government supporting media, I can easily say that this stupid-ass Turkish government openly supports those terrorists. They even support volunteers from Turkey, who want to go there and help those victims of the civil war and ISIS terrorists. 
Hey can we put WW3 on hold for like 23 some days! Like that dying dude, I want to see episode 7 before I die.
Would love to see Turkey unravel after this shitstorm...those shitheads deserve it for supporting ISIS.

Apparently US military representitive is saying that this incident is to be solved between Russia and Turkey.
[Turkish letter to the UN] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUlvK0gXAAArhJn.jpg:large)
"violation of Turkish airspace at a depth of 1.36 miles and 1.15 miles for 17 seconds."
The event is not without precedent: 

In [2012 a Turkish military aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_2012_interception_of_Turkish_aircraft) went into Syria's airspace and it was shot down by Syrian forces. At the time Turkish president Abdullah Gül said, "it is routine for jet fighters to sometimes fly in and out over [national] borders."

We'll see how the story changes now that the shoe is on the other foot.

Turkish Armed Forces:[the plane has been warned 10 times in 5 minutes for violating Turkish airspace. The plane has been intervened by 2 F-16] (http://www.tsk.tr/3_basin_yayin_faaliyetleri/3_1_basin_aciklamalari/2015/ba_97.html)
Looks like the Russian Su-24 'Fencer' was hit by an AMRAAM radar guided missile. I wonder if the RWR (Radar Warning Receiver) in their aircraft alerted them to the fact radar of the Turkish F-16's was tracking them?? If it was an AMRAAM shot then it's highly likely the Turkish pilots shot  it down from beyond visual range (BVR). The Russian plane was probably circling near Turkish airspace but not violating it. Questions need to be asked how long were the Turkish pilots tracking ths Su-24 for and at what point  did they decide to engage???

The other scenario is that the Turkish pilots snuck up on the 'Fencer' and shot it within visual range with a heat seeking AIM-9M Sidewinder air-air to missile. The Turkish pilots would have had their radars in stand by mode so the RWR in the Russian 'Fencer' would not be alerted to their presence, they would have been guided to the aircraft by either AWACS or ground based radar. Another thing that is interesting is that the 'Fencer' had its wings fully extended. The 'Fencer' is a variable swing-wing aircraft like the F-14 Tomcat, F-111 and Tornado IDS/ADV. What this means is that the Russian crew were cruising at altitude with no idea they were under attack. Swept-wing aircraft usually fully sweep their wings back to be more aerodynamically efficient  at high speed. The 'Fencer' crew never had the time to engage afterburner and fully sweep their wings back to make an escape or take evasive action against the incoming missile.
What Russia says and what Russia does are totally opposite things.

4 days ago Turkey threatened 'serious consequences' if Russia didn't stop bombing Turkmen villages in north Syria. 
that violation is so miniscule i bet it happens all the time between other nations.su24 was probably hitting anti-assad turkmen targets which are supported by turkey so thats why they shot it down

saying this instead of issuing threats clearly tells that plane was in Turkey airspace.

Back in the 1980's, Russia (well, back then the USSR) shot down a civilian airliner that violated their airspace with no real consequences, nothing will come of this either.
Ok apparently snackbrav turkmen shot both of the pilots as they were parachuting:

WTF?
2 minutes to midnight
Turkey has been playing this game for far too long.  These countries can no longer appease the domestic terrorists in their population.
this is stupid.....
They entered into Turkish borders last month too...Turkey warned Russia many times about that...What would Russia do if unknown f-16 jets with bombs fly in Russian land...
Well, probably there will be no direct response, but we can surely expect to see more Russians in Syria from now on, smashing every little rebel Turkey supports. And when it comes to weapons, Russians have TONS of them. They will support the Kurds now just to fuck with Turkey as well.
Turkey has strick engagement rules at it' s Syria-Iraq border because Syria shot down one of Turkish Air Force' s F4 in 2012. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/9349777/Syria-shoots-down-Turkish-fighter-jet.html
After that Turkey changed air engagement rules.Both Russia and Syria knows about this.Here Russia invading Turkey' s airspace by "mistake" http://www.euronews.com/2015/10/05/moscow-says-violation-of-turkish-air-space-a-mistake/  . Turkish officials warned Russia about this several times.And now a Jet that bombing Turkmens (basically Turks that lives in Syria and Iraq) violating Turkey's airspace despite warnings (ten times on radio) and pilot didnt give a shit about that.I think Russia provoked Turkey and try to show some power and say i dont respect your rules.
Turkey is deliberately not helping Russia in its fight against ISIS.

By not opening the aerospace for the Russians, they are only showing more signs of supporting ISIS.

The West should start condemning Turkey for their ISIS support.
My guess so far would be the plane was tracking an ISIL oil convoy heading into Turkey - it's not really a secret Ankara is one of the best customers of the jihadists. There's been a useful comment here pointing out the Russian jet was a reconnaissance model. Look plausible to me it was following the oil trail that Russia's been actively targeting lately

Isn't shooting down people coming down on parachutes a war crime?
Russian jets path. Turkish resouces:
http://imgur.com/JoEZV59
While airspace is undoubtedly important, I can't help but think Turkey got themselves into some deep shit here due to the proximity and that fact that the Russian plane has no motive to be hostile even if they had drifted into Turkish airspace. 
I know Reddit is on the hate turkey circle jerk, and the let's kick them out of NATO bandwagon. But seriously America would shoot down a jet in a similar situation. 
Armenian here. 

Fuck Turkey. 

That is all.

They have been invading Greek airspace for over a decade now at least 2 times / week. The irony is massive for us.
Oh look, a bear! *poke*
Bear in mind that son of the Turkish President - Bilal Erdogan - owns a giant firm that in turn owns FOUR oil tankers. Just this year Erdogan bought an $18 million vessel. http://www.todayszaman.com/anasayfa_bilal-erdogans-firm-buys-4th-tanker-for-18-million_377642.html

Wonder what oil he's been transporting with it.
Where's that vault Tec rep?
Apparently one of the pilots is dead? https://mobile.twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/669095688907702272?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet NSFW
'Impossible to answer' whether right to self-defence will be invoked, says Putin's spokesman


Asked whether Russia will invoke its right to self-defence as envisaged in the UN Charter over the loss of its military aircraft on the Syrian-Turkish border, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitriy Peskov replied: "Until there are clarifying reports, it is impossible to answer this question." 

He said: "So far, the defence ministry has not yet confirmed what brought our warplane down. We know for a fact that the aircraft was in Syrian airspace, above Syrian territory."

He refused to confirm rumours that President Vladimir Putin was planning to call an extraordinary meeting of the Russian Security Council following the incident. 

But he added it is likely Putin may discuss the matter during talks with Jordanian King Abdullah II in Sochi today. 
Well Turkey's Kurdish rebels are probably going to get a lot of new guns from a mysterious source
Turkey is pissed off that Russia is pounding on their people. They were caught more than once supporting ISIS and rebels by providing open border, ammunition, and treating wounded at their hospitals. 
again?, why are they western allies 
Good job protecting terrorists Turkey
Wow, check this out. footage of rebels (?) taking out a Russian chopper. https://www.youtube.com/embed/IschF-ihjS0
Russian here.

Assuming Turkey isn't lying and the plane did in fact cross the Turkish border as shown by their released image. [This](http://i.imgur.com/vWpm66q.jpg) is what we get (not my image)

Approximately 5-8 seconds of airspace violation. There were no warnings. They shot it down in response to us bombing the Syrian terrorists they support, plain and simple.
How fast can we kick Turkey out of NATO?
Tagesschau reports that the plane/pilot has been warned before taking it down. Strange.
It'll be interesting to see what the Russian response to this is. It's probably only been a matter of time until something like this happened; Russia seem to have been making incursions into a few countries airspace (I know it's happened a couple of times in the UK) and with suspect Submarine activity off the Scottish &amp; Swedish coasts.

My take on what will happen. 
Russia stops all flights to and from Turkey. Russian tourists hence can't get to Turkey anymore, and Turkey looses some Russian tourist money. Putin sends the tourists to Sochi. Bilateral relations will stay cold for couple of years. 
[Megathread on /r/syriancivilwar](https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3u2dke/russian_warplane_shot_down_megathread/)
This is why everyone needs to put their bullshit aside and set up some sort of central command. If NATO and Russia REALLY want to defeat ISIS (which, who knows what Russia is really doing) then they need coordinated efforts. 

It's like that video game Mercenaries back in the day, it's a cluster fuck. 
13:18 CET, a rescue russian chopper (sent to investigate the crash site) was just shot down by local rebels. 
I have plane tickets from Russia to Czech Republic via Turkey. Fuck... 
It's not like this wasn't coming. There have been persistent and widespread terrorist attacks that were well-funded and the people behind them have been protected by Muslim nations for decades now. The war on terrorism is ultimately the war on the countries protecting and allowing this to continue. 
12 Oct'15 "Whistleblower FuatAvni: To gain total control Erdogan will do all to create chaos &amp; civil war in Turkey. He is so crazy he even plans shooting down a Russian plane, so country will be in war with Russia. If country is at war he can consolidate his position" [Twitter](https://twitter.com/azadirojava/status/653655644990521349)

Keep fucking around Putin.
Russia wont do anything, Turkey is safe in NATO. No war today boys and girls, sorry :(
A friend just posted this on Facebook, very insightful:

"The shooting down of a Russian plane is in essence a provocation by Turkey in order to try to divide the de facto alliance which is now being established by Russia and the West. Over the past weeks Turkish and Saudi supported groups have been increasingly aggressive against US and western supported groups, which used to be their allies. This shows their desperation in the face of the deal which was made last week after the Paris Attacks.

This deal, between all major western powers along with Russia, for the dividing up of the loot in Syria leaves out Turkey and Saudi Arabia who have been banking most on Jihadist groups in Syria. For Saudi Arabia and Turkey this defeat can have existential consequences. Both Erdogan and the Saudi regime are weak regimes who have been staggering from one crisis to another. Erdogan's war on the Kurds, his support for almost all Islamist groups in Syria and now this act, reveals his weakness in that he constantly overcomes a crisis by creating a new one.

The fact that he is now trying to force a response from Russia in order to force NATO to intervene on his behalf is utopian. NATO has no intention of attacking Russia. In fact the west needs Russia in Syria today to clear up the mess caused by US imperialism. Rest assured that Russia will counter Erdogan's move, but it will receive no significant response from NATO. Therefore this attack will merely lead to the widening of the divide between the West and its Turkish (as well as Saudi) allies and add to their deep organic crises."
I'd like to petition /r/worldnews to ban off topic comments, particularly these stupid fucking pun threads that dominate comment threads 
Well Turkey has warned Russia about violation of borders several times in past weeks i dont think somebody has rights to blame Turkey there. If you dont do something after 10 times warning, your oppenent will just keep doing it.
Russian defense ministry has confirmed that a Russian plane was shot down claiming it hasn't violated turkey's airspace 

So how bad is this? 
This isn't good for anyone..
Good lord, some of you people are practically *frothing* at the prospect of more war. WWIII! MAD! NATO! Article 5! Calm down, folks. It's a big deal, and an escalation, but it's not the fucking start of World War Three. The planet's not a game of Civilization, wars don't just automatically start when stuff like this happens. People rule the world, not defense treaties, and people are generally smart enough to not let situations like this get out of hand. 
Russians have been risking this for awhile. I'd imagine turkey will return the pilot and consider this a serious warning.
*Player 2 has joined the game.*
It's going to be an early Russian Christmas for the PKK.
This country has gone to hell... Fighting Kurds alongside ISIS with impunity, shouting their barbaric god is great during the marseillaise a week ago and now this? Not only do they not deserve a spot in the EU, they don't deserve a better diplomatic place on this planet than north korea has. And don't start me on generalizations, this is a government that has kept getting re-elected and a society that obviously supports this shit because they get cheap oil from terrorists.
https://mobile.twitter.com/CNNTURK_ENG/status/669098577524822016

It really violated turkish airspace, but if you look at this radar picture, if turkey shoots down Russian plane because this small accidental violation,then maybe it's time to send S300 to Syrian borders and punish turkey for the same thing,maybe next time when Turks will want to bomb Kurds again they will think otherwise..
[Wow fantastic timing on this article from NPR.](http://i.imgur.com/JcA4vlQ.jpg)
[One of the pilots are dead as evident in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Cdkf3Xx3nw)
IMO the most likely response is Russia arming the kurds with anti air weaponry.

In the future, Googling "Russia / Plane / 2015" will require a bit of patience and maybe the need to click on Page 2. It looks like an unfortunate combination.
FYI Turkey violates Greek borders like every week...Sould they do the same? nah..
http://www.rbc.ru/politics/24/11/2015/56545de69a7947d6787491f1

Putin has condemned the actions of Turkey, calling it "a stab in the back from the supporters of terrorism".

**Other details from the article:**

* the Russian fighter jet was hit by a rocket from the F16 fighter jet (air-air)
* height: 6 km
* distance from Turkish border: 1 km into the Syrian territory.

**UPDATE**

* Russian helicopter was taken down by a rocket fired by the Syrian rebels.
sweet, I was afraid we might run out of reasons for war. 
I can't say that I'm surprised.  Russia has been violating Turkish airspace repeatedly for the last few weeks with Turkey complaining about it nearly daily.  I think the response was disproportionate.  I don't think this will ultimately lead to war because there is little incentive to do so, but keep it under control.
Most comments here are pretty hilarious and sad at the same time. My brain feels molested by the stupidity of some users. Nothing will happen stop crying for World War 3.
Russian military always seem to think they are above any international laws and regulations. They try to bully smaller nations like this all the time because they think nobody will have the balls to do anything about it. It's a shame that it had to go this far, but I'm honestly glad someone stood up to them for once. I mean, imagine what would happen if someone repeatedly violated russian airspace like they themselves have been doing so many times.
Dear Turkey, if you could stop supporting ISIS that would be great. 
Man I hate these fucking Islamic State protectors and sucker punchers who run to NATO for protection. Hope NATO fucking leaves them out in the cold this time and Russia punishes them for doing this cowardly shit.
Turkey is such a joke of an ally on the best of days; doing this over some 5 minute airspace violation was damned imbecility. I know nothing big will come of it but as an American the sooner we cut them out of NATO, support their Kurdish rebels, and (hey, I can dream big) assassinate their Islamist president the better. 
There you have it folks. Islamic extremists using American weapons to shoot down Russian helicopters that are looking for a pilot who bombs ISIS. 


Is this Turkey's response for Russia bombing their ISIS tanker convoy just recently?
Well i think as a Turk, i have a few things to say as well.


First of all, like some people stated earlier, this is not the first time. There has been border violations for over 2 years now and both syrian and turks lost some jets and sadly pilots like today's incident. Turkey cares A LOT about their borders since the goverment wants their people to feel safe and wants their trust, which is imho very essential for a country near the middle east, the hell on earth.


Secondly, yes i wish they would just let go but we just can't know if there will be more and more everytime you let that happen. This was bound to happen one day or another.


And about the "serious consequences" ; i think there won't be any military actions against us, but like putin has said today, they are gonna play on "supporting terrorists" propaganda. I can't deny that Turkey has aided people at syria, the goverment is saying they are supporting the Turks living in syria against Kurds which are heavily armed by US and EU. But most of the Turkmens have joined ISIS already; see [these are the Turkmens we've been supporting,smh](http://i.radikal.com.tr/620x332/2015/11/23/fft107_mf6542113.Jpeg) ... And now i don't expect any western country to back us up, since Turkey will now be THE TERRORIST COUNTRY, well we've been for a while i guess, you can say by the comments...


And last but not least, from now on both Russians and westerners will support Kurdish terrorists, NATO may even change the PKK's statue of terrorist organization and oppress Turkey to give up on our land to give Kurds a free Kurdistan which can cause a civil war.

So tl;dr this was a stupid move, even if they cross the border to harass and we, the people of turkey will pay for it, not the retarded congressmen...also sorry for grammar mistakes.
Those 11m amphetamine pills must've made Turkey a bit jumpy..
Itt: people throwing around article 5 like they are experts on international law, treaties and foreign relations.
To put things in context, here is recent Turkey
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBRSfdAvsDQ

I'm bored of this modern day pissing contest. Russia does this kind of shit ALL the time. They frequently fly in air spaces they shouldn't be in and always have warning, if you don't want to get shot don't do it. 
&gt; ...but said it could prove the plane was over Syria for the duration of its flight

They'll understand if we're a bit jaded about them being able to "prove" where their units are at any given time. Seeing as how they could "Prove" they were never in Crimea...

(I kid of course, I do think Turkey's been premature this time. They've been itching for a reason to take a shot at the Russians, the fact the plane was hit, and fell in Syria suggests if it did cross the border, it was not a sustained incursion)
turkey sponsor isis and terrorism
This will probably get lost in the mass of this thread, but I'd like to see some discussion of Turkey's tacit support of ISIS. The buying of the oil, the support for the militants moving in and out of Turkey, and Turkey's slaughter of anti-ISIS Kurdish forces (and people).
Interesting that this happens after Russia destroys ISIS oil assets; Turkey is speculated to have dealings with ISIS.

http://www.businessinsider.com/links-between-turkey-and-isis-are-now-undeniable-2015-7
Why is Turkey a NATO member in the first place? I mean it's pretty clear for some time now that they are supporting ISIS and this is just another addition to that.

hmm I wonder what Russia would do if it was reversed..

....now they are escalating a conflict into a full-on global war.  Fuck you, Turkey.
Russia violated Turkish airspace many times over the past few months. The Turkish government even held a special meeting with Russian officials last month telling them that if this happened again they would be forced to retaliate with military force.

Russia fucked up and now they pay the price.

Isn't Turkey indirectly aiding I.S, in terms of buying their oil and allowing supply lines into their territory? If so, smacks of the Turks wanting to break up any potential 'grand coalition' to fight I.S.

Please, people. This talk of WWIII is killing my brain cells. Take a chill pill, ‘cause if something starts that, it sure as hell won’t be some jet getting shot down where no one even died.
The relevant area of airspace violation published by the turkish military is less than 5 km width. Asuming the jet traveled with 500 knots it takes about 20-30 seconds to cross that area, so something the turkish officials say is definitely wrong!

**~ 8:30AM**

* One or two suspects still entrenched. 

* The situation has lasted approximately 4 hours, the result of a police raid at a family's apartment in the heart of Saint Denis (close to the famous basilica).

* Officials - 1 confirmed death, but BFMTV cannot confirm if the death is that of a police officer or the terrorist. 

* Live images of police officers demanding passers by to raise their hands and be searched. Pro Tip - PLEASE stay indoors and don't stroll around in the area. Everyone is a suspect at this point. 

* EDIT: A passerby has been ~~killed~~ shot, unsure if fatal, in the cross fire. Again, ***PLEASE STAY INDOORS*** if you live or work near the area, stay home. 

* The area in question is la [Place Jean Jaures, near the Cathedral](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Place+Jean+Jaur%C3%A8s,+93200+Saint-Denis,+France/@48.936495,2.3552113,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47e66eb34c578479:0xd8e1f1b3945625c0). Literally the beating heart of Saint-Denis. 

 
**~ 6:45 AM Paris time**

* Witnesses report hearing gunfire and explosions starting approximately 4:30 AM local time and continuing intermittently since

* A police assault (RAID, France's SWAT equivalent) is confirmed to be underway in central Saint-Denis

* The target is reported to be Abdulhamid Abaaoud, the presumed brains behind the 13th of November attacks

* Several police officers are reported to be wounded

* Police on site state that suspects still remain entrenched inside an apartment

* Reports that 3 people have been arrested

* The situation is ongoing - so they are reiterating that everyone in the area should remain indoors and away from windows. 

* Schools are open except in the heart of Saint-Denis

* Messages from the Saint-Denis mayor's office: People who live in the area are advised to remain inside. Those who work in the neighborhood (this is the absolute heart of Saint-Denis) are advised to not go. Public transportation into the area is being halted. 


those kinds of situation can last some time. However without any hostages, time is playing against the terrorists.
RIP to the dog killed, its life was worth more than that of all of those fuckers puts together.

Looks like it's the motherfucker who planned (or helped to plan) the Paris attacks. Apparently his parents are horrified at what he has done, his dad said "Why would he want to kill innocent Belgians? We owe this country everything!" I can't BEGIN to imagine what it would be like to find out the kid you worked so hard to raise ended up this way.

What they should REALLY do is make a BIG PUBLIC TRIAL showing all the embarrassing pictures of him as an idiot spoiled Belgian teenager, all the ridiculous stuff he believes, all the horrible things he has done, and then lock him up in a tiny cell with 0 chance of ever killing himself or getting parole.

These are people who REALLY believe not only in life after death (with memories intact, even though those are known to be stored in the brain), but that they can improve their position therein by doing horrible things and dying during them. Lock em up, expose their hypocrisy and lunacy, and DEPRIVE THEM MARTYRDOM.
The guy periscoping this can speak like 20 languages. WTF?
I'm really impressed by the ability of police to track down and find the people responsible after something like this. Much like after the Boston Marathon bombing.
It is weird that they'd just sit there in the city that they attacked and wait for French authorities to find them. They had to know that they'd connect all the dots pretty quickly. What the hell?
Man French police really get shit done.
Serious kudos to French police right now. They are dealing with a lot.
These people have no care for human life, are heavily armed and will die before being captured. These cops are the closest thing a human being will get to being a superhero.
BFM TV (french TV) just announced on air the target was allegedly Abaaoud, the planner behind the attacks who was thought to be in Syria.

Edit 12:40AM:  "SDAT" (Anti-Terrorism Sub-Directorate, elite counter-terrorist task-force) and all other elite french police forces are on the scene. BFM confirmed that target is Abaaoud, still TBC if he is there. 3 people barricaded in an apartment.
According to Le Monde:

After Fridays attack in Bataclan, a cellphone was found from a trash can. That phone contained a message from one of the attackers from Bataclan, saying "The hits have started". Using that phone and the information gathered from it, the police was able to track down contact. 
The church bells that just went on in the distance sounded so eerie...
The problem I have with periscope is OPSEC. Giving away troop and police movements helps the terrorists. Do not give them any advantage by streaming live out your window on a situation like this. You could get the good guys killed.

EDIT:  Conflicting report from source in Paris who was just on phone live with MSNBC, said 2-3 men still inside and have a current standoff with the police.  MSNBC live stream:  http://www.hulkusc.com/watch-msnbc-live-streaming/

EDIT:  Twitter source just updated and also confirms there are 2-3 people still alive and holed up inside at a standoff.

EDIT:  Paris woman on phone with MSNBC again just confirmed that 2 policemen have been injured.

EDIT:  Six explosions just went off live on air on CNN 1:29 AM ET
3 people arrested, 1 killed, 1 women carrying suicide belt.

According to EU radio station (via sky news)
Live thread right here: https://www.reddit.com/live/vxrnaag5jhld
reports are saying one policeman has been killed

Edit: This came from a Brazilian news station. Not sure on the credibility. Currently they are saying the men have barricaded themselves in the house and one of the residents has been killed as well. Once again, not sure on the credibility. 

Edit: BFM TV (french TV) just announced on air the target was allegedly Abaaoud, the mastermind behind the attacks who was thought to be in Syria.
Listening to french tv. They said that the guys were probably geolocalised via their cell phone and that there was a group left in paris to do further attacks.
Apparently the terrorists were just about to leave to attack the business district. That's why the woman happened to wear a suicide vest.
Two suspects dead according to phone source Laura Haim on MSNBC. 
"More suspects" still holed up inside alive.

Suspect inside is ABDELHAMID ABAAOUD - the mastermind of terror attacks:  http://imgur.com/IdxI5yL
He joined ISIS in 2013 - his father is ashamed of him.  He recruited his 13 year old brother into ISIS.

Twitter source also updated that two suspects dead inside:
https://twitter.com/th3j35t3r/with_replies

EDIT:  Sky News just said 5 suspects inside.  (Unsure if that includes the two deceased)


I'm near the assault, about 50m. We are hearing explosions and gun fights. Can't go outside and close to windows.
Kind of warplace there.

TIL: sending a few retarded cunts into a club to shoot around makes you a "mastermind"
They definitely thwarted atleast 1 more attack with this raid. They are reporting a woman blew herself up with a suicide bomb, a bomb that certainly would have been used on unsuspecting civilians.
"Police have confirmed that a seven-year-old belgian shepherd police dog called Diesel was killed in the raids in St-Denis this morning."

A good 50+ military arrived at the street

I wish ISIS would just fuck off already.
That female terrorist with the suicide belt could've caused so many more deaths in Paris. Thank the gods for the Paris police. 
It appears that the man who rented out the apartment is among those arrested by police during the raid this morning.

He has been speaking to AFP - the news agency says he spoke to them “on condition of anonymity before being handcuffed and led away by police.”

A friend asked me to put up two of his friends for a few days

I said that there was no mattress, they told me ‘it’s not a problem’, they just wanted water and to pray.

I was asked to do a favour, I did a favour. I didn’t know they were terrorists.

AFP report his female friend was also taken into custody. She told the news agency that she had slept in the apartment last week and the dwelling was “a kind of squat.”

The two visitors arrived “two days ago,” she said.
The operation is to target abdelhamid abaaoud , the brain of the recent attack on paris but also the brain of other attack such as the attack on the Thalys.



So far 3 men has been arrested but Abdel is still surrounded in it's home.




**Who is AbdelHamid Abaaoud?**

This men is a young Belgian ,28 years old, that went to Syria and brought his you brother , 13 year old, infamous for killing an American.

He is a recruiter for Daesh and the mastermind behind multiple attacks such as the Thalys , Friday's attack on Paris or an attack on a police station in Belgium.

- Abdel is still surrounded and seems to have men in his apartment with him.

- according to BFMTV expert the explosion sounds we hear mean the assault is being given


7:40am edit:

- One terrorist killed by a sniper


- A woman killed herself by blowing herself with a bomb. (Can't find a source except for french TV)
Live feed confirmed it, a woman's blew herself up.

- A helicopter is flying over the scene


- BFMTV report that a passerby has been killed by the fire exchange by a lost bullet


- At least one Raid policeman is wounded , he was transported to La Pitié-Salpêtrière

- The intervention is coming to an end said Taubira, minister of Laws


8 am edit:

- the assault seems to have ended , no information on what happened in the apartment
Well done, French Police
**11:37 (UTC+1) : The raid is over. Building still being searched for explosives.**

* 2 dead (a suicide bomber woman and another presumed terrorist),
* 7 arrested (2 in the flat, 3 in another flat also being targeted, 2 in the area including the owner of the flat),
* 5 wounded RAID personnel,
* 1 RAID assault dog killed
Apparently the woman with the suicide belt (as opposed to vest) was arrested and didn't get the chance or use the opportunity to detonate her vest.

Edit
Unconfirmed - from the live thread.  [unconfirmed] 2 terrorists are dead and one women
Edit 2 
Sky News is reporting that a female with a suicide vest or belt didn't detonate her vest. Conflicting reports from different news outlets.
Live thread: https://www.reddit.com/live/vxrnaag5jhld
Here's a livestream from France 24 English https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7t_GWXmgFk they're currently covering the events.
This needs a live thread
[Live stream in English. France 24](http://www.france24.com/en/livefeed)
Local press reporting: 2 dead, 3 arrested (via SkyTV).
It's over. 3 dead 3 arrested.
Just to clear all the rumors.

1 Civilian dead. Not confirmed.

2 terrorists dead. Confirmed. 1 man shot by sniper, 1 woman blew herself up.

3 people extracted from apartment and under custody. Identities not confirmed.

2 people arrested in the streets around the apartment. 1 man (presumed owner of apartment) and 1 woman.

It's unclear whether there are 2 or 1 people still in the apartment. Abaoud thought to be one of them.

EDIT: All according to BFMTV live coverage. http://www.bfmtv.com/mediaplayer/live-video/

Really wish the news would stop referring to the suspect as a 'mastermind'
Watching all of these European news sources makes me realize how much I hate how the US reports the news. Especially live news.
CNN is showing the videos right now, they're interviewing someone over the phone
Ambulances racing to the scene apparently.
Subject of raid is the mastermind behind the attacks:
https://twitter.com/lemondelive/status/666861087988563968
L'un des organisateurs présumés des attentats, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, est la cible de l'assaut à Saint-Denis

~~female had suicide vest on, failed to detonate according to media~~  
female confirmed detonated
Got to hand it to the French Security forces, they have done a stellar job. Hopefully they get this bastard alive, but I doubt thats going to happen. 
Fair play to French authorities, that is a fuck load of armed response units. 
Official statement from the prosecutor :

edit : translation below
One silver lining out of all of this situation: people united. I see guys here that don't know each other hoping and worrying for each others safety. I see images like they have shown of the english and french both singing along to the french nationa anthem. I see Rudsia and USA "trying" to get some kinda of agreement to fight terrorism (one might argue they are to blame for this situation but let's leave that a side for now). All of this kind of makes me proud and a brings me a tear of Joy.  The humanty is good after all,even if it is just for that second when we are all feeling scared and that gives me so much hope.

We shouldn't fear isis. They should fear us.
[Pictures](https://twitter.com/peggybrug/status/666999294227038209) of the appartment after the assault.
I was once smoking weed in Saint Denis during Ramadan on the pull out bed of a lover while her immaculate Algerian friend laid on the bed playing GTA (vice city?) and complaining how her New Zealander boyfriend wouldn't stop fingering her butthole in public. Of course I agreed it was inappropriate. I miss you girls. 
It's been a bad year for France, what the fuck man. 
RIP [K9 Diesel](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/diesel-named-as-police-dog-killed-in-saint-denis-raids-hunting-for-paris-attackers-a6738826.html)
Apparently one of RAID's assault dogs was killed during the firefight. His name was Diesel: 

https://twitter.com/Conflicts/status/666918514821881857

RIP Diesel. :(
If this is the 9th guy... too bad he gets to go out in a 'blaze of glory.'  Much rather he rots away in the bastille or something.
Reports that officers were shot? Fuck.
Really would love to see some sort of organized purchasing of pastries, croissants or something from the internets to give to the first responders, police and military there. Hell of a job. Nothing I could ever do. 
I know this isn't really the time, but I think the special police units (are they RAID guys?) look so cool in their jeans and balaclavas. Like dress down Friday but tougher looking.

My guess is they are using flash bangs so they can move out civilians, so they don't get hurt.
Sky News &amp; Radio Europe One:  3 people have been arrested, 1 killed.  1 Arrested is a woman who had suicide belt attached to her.
Police are confirming there is a woman inside an apartment wearing a suicide belt. Canal Plus via MSNBC
Civilian passerby was killed. Female subject detonated suicide belt. Male subject shot by sniper. Standoff is over. 
damn, so much thing about the bell ringing. people, it's just the local church giving the time, it's quite common on catholic countries.

I wonder what's going thru the 1 guy still in the apartment's head right now. Is he sad? Thinking of a way to escape? Thinking of a way to fight back? Scared? Nervous? Happy?
Is it just from the sources I've read, or are the French police/SWAT and whatnot really fucking good?
Enjoy jail time you fuking terrorist piece of Shit.
Hopefully Abaouud is taken alive.
Several police officers injured and one police dog killed.

Update on my last, man escorted from building, initial view on sky news was from the front, police with shield blocking camera view. 

Picture from HuffPost, mild nudity warning (rear). 

BMFTV 6 people in the apartment: 3 were arrested very early, one kamikaze woman blew herself up, another terrorist killed by sniper from helicopter, and still 6th person in the building, not sure if alive or dead.
BMFTV ceiling collapsed with the bomb, 6th suspect might be under rubble or have made a trap why the assault is still ongoing. Anti bomb Little robots being sent in. (not sure how to translate robot demineur)
[New video from balcony of shooting going on](https://twitter.com/myteks/status/666839939112427520)
listening to French Radio. The guy who organized the massacre is cornered in a flat in St Denis. Apparently a woman blew herself up. The whole area is blocked and all people in the building have been evacuated

- several explosions...possibly grenades
- military arrived in St Denis (St denis is a suburb north of Paris, it is very heavy Arabic suburb)
- waiting...announcement that schools in St Denis are closed tomorrow
- Abdelhamid Abaaoud is suspected to be the one who machined gun people outside the restaurants
- Still one person in the condo
- 3 deaths and 3 arrest so far
- Telling people to stay home 
- Salah Abdeslam is in the building with Abdelhamid Abaaoud cornered


EDIT: Stopping edits since this post left main page
On the plus side it looks like reddits formula is working. 
Poor pup, he was a hero. I hope him and the Cosmonaut dog are playing together somewhere, with the other hero dogs.
Apparently "a number of suspects pinned down" according to the local mayor? As just reported in CNN
I wonder if the threats against the Air France flights were made by and then tracked to these guys in St-Denis.
7:29 (GTM+1 FR)
There's a a report of one passer-by killed (unconfirmed) many explosions heard, and automatic fire still ongoing, right now. On the TV live feed I clearly heard 7 or 8 stunning/flash grenades.

In Saint-Denis, there's the BRI and RAID special police forces on site, first shots/explosions began near 4:30, since this moment the whole area is surrounded, It's 800m away the stadium that was attacked last friday.
It's very likely the mastermind is there holed in an appartement with at least one other person.

7:38 : 1 terrorist dead killed by a sniper, 1 women dead, blown herself, and several wounded on the police side.

Radio says At least 6 people in the condo, 3 arrested 1 dead plus a woman that blew herself up.

Still not over, one left.
Apparently there's one left.
Three fatalities:  One innocent passer by, one suicide bomber, one suspect shot via police sniper.

One suspect still inside.

-Sky News
Sky news reporting still one suspect remaining in the apartment.
Guess the cops found their hideout. Sucks that a civilian got caught in the crossfire.  
One thing a lot of people aren't really talking about is how there's a large possibly that ISIS has a bomb maker somewhere in France. We know all of the terrorists from Fridays attacks had suicide vests on, plus at least another one tonight. I find it very unlikely that they could smuggle that many explosives over the borders but I suppose anything is possible.
BBC: one police dog killed in action :(
According to BFM TV, a police dog was killed when the police entered the appartment. 

http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/assaut-a-saint-denis-un-chien-policier-tue-pendant-l-assaut-931036.html
A ton of shooting on periscope https://www.periscope.tv/philippweber/1ynKOgmmwkzKR
giulia paravicini ‏@gparavicini  

''A French police source told POLITICO's @maiadelabaume the raid took place at 48 rue du Corbillon in Saint-Denis. Police went there to question suspects at around 4:30 a.m. but they were greeted by heavily armed people including a woman who started shooting at them and then blew herself up.''

https://twitter.com/gparavicini
I'm watching I-Télé, they announced that the five policeman injured during the assaults were only lightly wounded.
BFMTV : still looking for salah and another. Police force looking on other floors for traps. assault still ongoing. 5 cops injured during assault so far.
According to Le Monde:

After Fridays attack in Bataclan, a cellphone was found from a trash can. That phone contained a message from one of the attackers from Bataclan, saying "The hits have started". Using that phone and the information gathered from it, the police was able to track down contact. 
Copenhagen airport evacuated apparently 
Isis is going to have these small victories here and there b/c they're fucking cowards who take advantage of peoples' generosity and acceptance to only shoot them in the back. However, if they knew how much the free world resists these motherfuckers and if they only knew how fucking hard the hammer is going to drop on them they would stop now. All they're going to do is provoke the world until there will literally be nothing left of them or their group. Maybe once half a million of their citizens in raqqa are killed in a massive bombing attack then they might reconsider... but probably not b/c we all know "they love death more than we love life."
RIP Diesel. A true hero.
France is kicking some serious ass. 
One resident of the house that the terrorists are in has died.
It has been confirmed that two terrorists have been killed as of now. Some policemen were wounded. This is an operation of the special forces (BRI and RAID), with an helicopter as cover. 
Home this will end well.
So what new rights and permissions exactly does the "state of emergency" status of France give the police force? I know if I woke up to gunfire and explosions at 4:30 am I'd shit my pants.
* Female did detonate her suicide belt.
* 1 man killed by sniper
* Initial death was passer by in street

(via Sky TV)
people are speculating this was a raid on the ring leader but it could also have been the second sleeper cell that was raided on, aye?
"Counter-Terroists win".
So the woman blew herself up with a suicide belt.

Does she now get 72 Virgin men in heaven / paradise?

If so, 72 Virgin men sounds like a crap deal.
Please let this be a false alarm. 

Edit - it's not. This is awful. 

I'm really hoping this is involving one of terrorists they're looking for and not something completely new. 


Fuck, so much craziness going on.



People suck.
RIP Diesel the Shepard Dog
completely off topic but man the french firefighters helmets are boss!!!!
Guys, I get it, they should be tried in a court of law like any other man...  but can I at least pretend we push them down the up escalator that's been newly covered in cheese graters?
How fucking insane do you be to put on a bomb belt and run directly at a special forces unit in a major international city? 

What the fuck is even going through their fucking heads?
RIP "Diesel" (the dog)
I'm watching Hollande's speech live and I'm asking myself: Is France "going Patriot Act"?...
Daily Mail has a picture of the assault teams dragging one of the cunts through the streets with his bare ass out.

We need more coverage like that. Ridicule the fuckers.

RIP Diesel.
My dad lives in the Saint-Denis area, really hoping he is safe right now.
report that 7 officers injured, SAMU there
Multiple live streams: http://breaking911.com/breaking-french-police-in-shootout-with-suspect-in-st-denis-paris/
Lets hope this was the last active terrorist group in Paris.  More will come later but peace is needed now.
so apparently one of the guys on the run didn't detonate his bomb for some reason?

Where are the CNN cameras set up? A series of explosions go off from one  camera, but the other, showing an alley filled with firemen, seem completely unfazed. Is there some editing going on, are they super far apart, or what? 
I've seen a police raid go down before, those sounds sound very similar to concussion grenades. I don't think they are grenades or explosives.
Europe 1 radio station via sky is reporting that 3 have been arrested including one woman with a suicide vest (wot?!) and one killed

one suspect killed by a sniper,  another (female) suspect detonated a suicide bomb according to msnbc 
 2 terrorists dead, Woman did detonate her belt - sky news. 

Unfortunately a passer by was also killed :( RIP
Sky News:  Suspect killed via police sniper

http://news.sky.com/watch-live
Ok serious question.  They say a women detonated a suicide vest.  What kind of explosives would only kill her?  Happened at the stadium too.
It almost looks like they're blocking the view on the street from the cameras on CNN....that might be indicative of something about to go down.
Le Monde and other French media say they have confirmation from police and judicial sources that the three fugitives in the apartment are dead, including a woman who blew herself up with an explosive belt.
Qui ici vient de Saint-Denis? Est-ce-que vous pouvez nous disez qu'est ce qu'il passe?
French police have reported that the third gunman has been killed. Unfortunate that they couldn't bring him in alive, but glad nonetheless that this is dying down. 
I just heard another gun shot on a stream.
Do they have a robot or a quadcopter they can send in to scout out the room this guy is holding up in? I feel like that would be really handy right about now.
Anyone got a better Periscope link?
So what were the explosions? 
I hope these scumbags get caught alive so they can serve a nice long sentence of solitary confinement.
CNN reporting 3 terrorists are dead and 3 terrorists have been arrested
Listening to BFMTV in French - (again, maybe someone who's also listening can confirm): They interviewed the guy who rented out the apartment in question. He said he was asked by a friend to rent it out to two friends for a few nights. Was subsequently arrested.
Good work Paris Police!

Assault isn't over, apparently they haven't enter the appartment yet because of possible booby traps
Serious question. Why are they seemingly targeting France specifically? 
BBC report another explosion 10 minutes ago, armed plod searching street to street. 

Now saying police confirm armed operation is over.

Definitely gun shots, hope nobody is hurt.
Christ, all of this is mentally exhausting - I can only imagine what it's like for the people of Paris. Thinking of the police putting their lives on the line to protect people and make sure that innocents stay safe.
Here's the live thread: https://www.reddit.com/live/vxrnaag5jhld
Dude on bfmtv rented out his place for a couple days to the terrorists, had no idea they were terrorists, was just doing a favor for a friend.
They killed a police dog. BASTARDS. 
Kind of sick of all the "They should really arrest, not kill them!"  Well yeah no shit that'd be nice, but when they are entrenched shooting everything up with an AK and have explosive vests, it makes walking up to them and slapping on some handcuffs a little difficult.  Most important thing is to protect the police and civilians safety, and that usually involves shooting to kill in these situations.
French Police Dog killed in the Saint-Denis raids reported by the BBC :( 
Damn, the police dog died. :(
A police dog had died during the raid. RIP Diesel, a creature much braver than the Daesh cowards who slaughtered the innocents.

They don't want to coexist with us.
- 2 or 3 terrorists in an apartment ,some maybe wounded or dead.
- 2 wounded among the police.
- 3 terrorists under arrest.
- situation is frozen , police are waiting for negotiations . 
This is rather odd. I am watching a live stream, albeit indirectly of a counter terrorist operation.  A fucking terrorist hunt through Paris. That's so sad, but also interesting. 
This is starting to feel like Children of Men.

French people do not fuck about. They are One. 
*The company is “working to minimize any disruption to people’s access to Facebook in Belgium.”*


Tracking people without a facebook account, making ghost profiles for those who don't have one, stealing numbers from contacts if you're using their app and making ghost facebook profiles for those who don't already have an account will disrupt the usage of Facebook in Sweden?

They're a joke.
Behind their active monitoring of everything typed for key words, the scariest thing about facebook is the shadow profiles. You may have a profile on facebook without ever visiting the website, it just is not visible until you join. 

When your friends download and use facebook, the app/service scours the device for contact information for the people that person knows, names, phone numbers, email addresses, other social media accounts, and it sends that home to facebook's servers. Now, one data point isnt enough to tell anything, but if everyone you know does it, then they know that you exist, they know who you are through your metadata, and who you know because of who has your number on their phones. They know that John Doe exists, has this phone number/email address, and is friends with Steven, Sara, and Kevin. When they draw a map of the social groups/networks of the users, they map out that Steven knows Sara, and Kevin knows Jessica, and there is a little greyed out bubble for you, John Doe, with a line drawn between you and Steven and Sara, and between you and Kevin, which leads them to the conclusion that you are acquainted with Jessica.

Thanks to the willingness of your friends to use this service, they can map out who you know, and everyone you are likely to know, without you even so much as signing up or clicking a like button. 

The Stasi would have killed for this kind of data.  
And stands to make 300,000 euros a day if it continues.
&gt; faces a fine of € 250,000

pshhhh

&gt; a day

oh
Zuckerberg: "You're right, I did lose a quarter-million yesterday. I expect to lose a quarter million dollars today. I expect to lose a quarter million dollars tomorrow. You know, Belgium, at the rate of a quarter-million dollars a day, I'll have to close this place in... 560 years." 
Anyone know the current situation for deleted profiles, do they still get to store it all after you "remove" it? That should really be changed too if so.
Is there a way I can ask Belgium to add me to their complaint list?
I hope Facebook isn't too quick in fixing this. Less taxes for me.
Belgium should join the TPP then Facebook could counter sue and get this decision reversed.
Holy shit, the exchange rate has dropped a lot.
I wish they would do the same in the U.S.

They shut me out of my account, and won't let me back in unless I send in my birth certificate. So, they're holding my information hostage and won't let me have it unless I send them even more. 
it would be nice if my country cared as much about me as Belgium does about it's citizens. 
GO BELGIUM! Honestly Facebook's actions can be despicable.
I noted in Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_like_button#Tracking
Does not that make all the Company Directors spies?
I'm pretty ignorant on this. How is facebook storing data if people aren't users in the first place?
Facebook sucks
Remember when Spyware was concidered a nono?

Now people install it on their computers willingly!

As a Belgian, I am very happy with this.
All of Facebook's litigation should be delivered as Minion memes.
I've never completely understood how governments can just levy fees or fines against foreign corporations for violations of local laws when (say) the corporations aren't even based there?

In other words: what prevents a company like Facebook from telling the Belgian government to "go pound sand" and ignore the fine, as well as the original government's court orders and decrees?


Exactly the guardian was probably Facebook's a biggest cheerleader...yet pro Snowden.
Yeah that sounds logical doesn't it.
Pro big brother yet supposedly anti big brother..except snowden has stated he supports widespread surveillance, he just said he thinks the public should know about it.
There is a huge difference therefore in playing off snowden as anti big brother, when in fact he is pro big brother fascism..and by association the guardian also.

Notice also there has never been a serious discussion or campaign in this paper about abolishing the surveillance state. No, the discussion has always been about our knowledge of it..knowledge and if you actually listened to Snowden..public acceptance.

Good.
Pretty sure FB and Google didn't fight CISRA or whatever it's called. Also didn't they sell massive amounts of dadta to the NSA?  Unlike Yahoo that fought it?
Belgium is the fucking shit. I grot hammered there cuz beer was not a lot of euros. Fuck Facebook
&gt;Personal Data From Non-Users

[How do they even get this?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z32-eLOoAUU)
Remember a couple decades ago when the US government started fining microsoft a million dollars and they decided to just keep paying the fine..
I'm glad the Europeans are fighting our battles for us, hopefully we'll make progress on our front soon.
Facebook is evil, but it supplies so many narcissistic pleasures I'm not surprised people use it.
Facebook is basically saying cyber crime on another country is okay as long as your servers aren't there and their laws don't apply to yours.

I don't hope that FB goes down because it does keep so much retardness at bay (imagine if all that shit go out in the world outside facebook). But it sure is fun to see them eat shit from time to time when they go too far.
Mark Zuckerburg was heard to say:  *"Heehee, that tickles!"*
Whats to stop them from telling them to fuck off basically?
If Mark Zuckerberg paid 100 years of this fine up front, it wouldn't even take away half of his net worth.
How funny would it be if Mark wrote a check and said, "this should cover is for the next 10 years."
But will they make more than 250K euros if the continue?
theyll have shit on the government would they not? some government people must use it.
That's it's done! 
I created an account for two weeks in 2007 I think and "deleted" after. A couple of years ago I think I liked something or did an auto login with a Facebook account, I really can't remember the details, and my account was reactivated. I didn't even realize I had a Facebook account until I googled myself and saw it. 
So why exactly would Facebook want my data if I'm not using it? Is it for ads?
They need to target businesses other than Facebook. Facebook is probably the least of their worries. You ever hear about Facebook taking its users to court, and suing them for thousands of dollars on a regular basis? Those Hollywood creeps are certainly doing that.
Sounds like Belgium is soon to get a new government.
This overreach is gross.
When they came for the whole country?
How are they getting info to store from non-users?
sooo how much is the fine in real money?
Facebook should sue Belgium for lost profits.
Now, one data point isnt enough to tell visitors that they are a terror suspect.
I didn't realize the Euro and the Dollar were that close these days.  Thanks.
"No." said Facebook.
A good way to fuck with fb is to stop posting. They are really losing on content lately.  Now they are telling people to wish people happy birthday, let you know what is going on in the area etc.

Apparently it's come to a crawl lately
I'm sure that the "explicit consent button" will be as effective as the EU cookie policy. No real explanation of what it does, no real option to opt out (only to not use the website). All it means is that you need to click away another box.

There will be no change in behaviour by corporates. The thinnest veil of pretence so that someone can claim to have done something.
https://youtu.be/nXrKKwHmPz4 Here's what your face looks like when you are confronted about subverting the privacy of the human race forever.
Why only Facebook? What's with all the others?
Until the general people decides to move away facebook as a contact base. Which isnt happening yet.
That's why you need to use Disconnect etc.  Fuck FB. 
Left facebook 2 years ago. Still getting notifications on my instagram when a facebook friend joins it
Ghostery got sold to AdBlock+ IIRC.
That's how we do it: need money for the state treasury? Let's sue some company for € 91 250 000 a year. /jk

No surprise actually, Belgium got some pretty great privacy laws.
Yes that'll convince them -Some naive guy
Good. Fuck facebook.
And yet if a national government demands that ISPs retain a record of sites visited that they can only access after getting a warrant from a judge everyone loses their mind. Not to say that govt spying is good and protests are not needed but more that people should be going crazy at corporate spying and data use.

how does this compare to the consequences for Google's Street view cars getting caught grabbing everyone's wi fi networks in Europe? 

 It must be so strange to be told, " we're not grabbing our ankles for you AND you're not our corporate overlords!"   

A few months of $7.5mil USD (per month in fines) would likely be an undesirable outcome.  
Please don't comply Facebook. Our government needs the money for the budget.

damn
Practically speaking, this just means Facebook won't do the collection using servers in Belgium.
They are going to have to sue literally every site on the internet if they are serious about this.

This judgment reads like it was written by people who have absolutely no idea how the internet works.  
Out of curiosity, what teeth does Belgium have?  If Facebook refuses to pay the fine will the US government make them?  If not, and Belgium refuses to let Facebook do business in their country what does that mean exactly for an internet company?  Will they just block the website for the whole country?  Do they have the capability to do that?
Which basically means Facebook will be flat broke one week before the Earth crashes into the Sun.

Can someone explain how they are able to enforce this fine. What if Facebook just said no and doesn't pay the fine?
What happens if facebook says fuck it i won't pay?
"$269,000 a day? Ok, ill check my couch" -Facebook-
Can a country really impose fines out of the blue like that? Do the fines actually have to be paid or can Facebook just ignore it?
I'm kind of curious exactly how they could enforce this...
"No shit, *that*'ll convince them". -Some naive guy 
Side note: Did anyone notice through this headline just how much the Euro has tanked in recent years?
So... What exactly happens if Facebook throws its hands up and refuses to pay? Do they even have offices in Europe?

I mean, what could Belgium do? Censor Facebook? I'm not sure that would be a believable threat.

I mean really, what would happen?
This may sound super superficial, but Mark Zuckerberg's face has this super untrustworthy look... which is why I dropped out of facebook.  
  
Also, that D8 interview that had Zuckerberg sweat his balls off from all of the questions.
I keep telling my dog to not shit on the floor. Let's see who stops doing what first.
I'm about to blow all your minds: EVERY large website logs traffic, EVEN if they don't have profiles.  

I'd bet my balls on it.
can someone please enlighten me how to file i fine against facebook, i need some money
What happens if they don't comply? What exactly enforces the verdict? 
Lolz Facebook still exists, what a joke. Same with all social media. I give it just a few more years until this bubble bursts and we humans realize we're actually becoming dumber by the day by exposing ourselves to useless information.

Wowzers! The EUR/USD rate is so low! Facebook can definitely just keep doing this especially with the trend of the exchange rate!

"Oh..."
Honestly, the company is American, the servers are American, the revenue is going to America. How can a Belgian court order it to do anything? Would they threaten to block Facebook in their country? It seems like North Korea telling Sony not to release "The Interview" because making fun of the leader is illegal.
It really is nasty here folks.  Earlier in the month we had a stretch of 4 days-in-a-row of 200-400 pm2.5.  Now we're in the middle of another one with the reading presently showing 480 (edit: now 570).  Visibility is no more than 300-500 meters.  We do get good days, but that's only when the wind picks up and blows it off to the east. When it calms down, it takes about a day for the pollution to get back to the 180-200 level.   This is my 4th year living in this city and while the summer seemed to give me hope that the pollution was decreasing, this early winter has me losing it.  There's been too many days I've had to 'nope' out of running or exercising, or even going outside.  Supposedly sunny, pretty days, just ruined.  Sigh------"Cough!"

&gt;The concentration of PM2.5, the particulates that pose the greatest risk to human health, as of 9:34 p.m. Saturday was 300 micrograms per cubic meter -- which is about 12 times higher than World Health Organization-recommended limits.

&gt;The air quality worsened Sunday and the center upgraded the alert without providing an updated pollution reading.

That's some really dirty air.
This is where they should have held that climate summit!!!!

Uh oh, they better raise the legal definition of pollution again before things get worse!
I've never been to Beijing, but I lived in Shanghai for 3 1/2 years. The winter's pretty bad. Two years ago to this month the AQI hit 500. (There was a meme "This air pollution is too Shanghai!") Anyway, I remember that the adult English school that I taught at didn't bother to even close down for the day. The even craziest part? When I came into work, the little old cleaning maids (just like a lot of old Chinese people) had all the windows open to let in the "fresh air" for the morning.
Two pics I took of the smog when I was there in summer. You could look directly at the sun without squinting, it was so obscured.

Here in New Delhi it might be worse. These past 2 weeks, as winter approaches, its been from 300-400 pm2.5 almost all the time. 
thats what happens when you pack 2/3 of the canadian population into a city
It's pretty bad here right now (Chaoyang District - East side of Beijing) - PM2.5 is almost 600 right now and still rising.

Seriously, what is being done to reduce this? 
There is no pollution in Ba Sing Se. 
[Here is an album of photos taken from my livingroom window in Wudaokou, Beijing. The last picture is from today](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZPYYN/new)
It's like a radiation storm coming from the glowing sea in the south west.
Think about this when the climate pledges come out of Paris next month. 
Delhi just recently overtook Beijing as the most polluted city in the world, so if you think this is bad, imagine what it's like their and I have a feeling that it will get much worse before it gets better.

It's like we humans are automatically set up to react only when things reach a ridiculously alarming level, but then again, when you're making billions, you will be blinded by anything.


I found this website that tracks air quality across China (and the rest of the world):

http://aqicn.org/city/beijing

They're up to "hazardous" right now for Beijing, with some reports of AQI at 800+ meanwhile my current city has an AQI of 12...

Edit: I don't know if they're doing it on purpose to try to reduce the city average, or if the sensor is malfunctioning (maybe it gave up on life after measuring so much crap in the air?), but these guys are now reporting an AQI of 13 in [downtown Beijing](http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/qianmendongdajie/)
Suddenly, Tesla Model X's air filtration system makes total sense.
How are people living there still alive??
Whatever China is doing, it's definitely not working. Hopefully it'll have the same solution as Los Angeles's before/after pollution control. 
I lived in Beijing for a number of years, the worst I remember was 600ppm, it was like the apocalypse. Then there was one night when I thought it was snowing, except it was just large flakes of dust falling from the skies. Reminded me of those stories you hear of Mount Vesuvius and Pompeii, how it erupted and covered its inhabitants with dust. 

Recently moved down to Shanghai and it's better, but there are still bad days and it's not getting any better. Most people I know from Beijing have either already left or can't wait to get out because of the pollution.
Air pollution is a huge issue in India too. I'm an American in India right now and every day I look at the PM2.5 and PM10, I see abnormal readings. I really feel like I'm suffocating all the time - I'm sure it's psychological but super concerning nonetheless. 
As long as the big companies and their government cronies are raking in the money, who cares about the billions of people breathing poison, right?
Is this the future our planet's destined for? Scary thought that this is how it could end up in most major cities. Pollution forecasts along side the weather forecast will become a normal thing. Our fog will be replaced by hazardous pollutant and our beaches will contain more little plastic bits than actual sand. I'm so curious how the world will end up looking in the distant future.
In India, many cities have more than PM 2.5 300 on regular basis these days
The sad thing is that I've read Delhi is a lot worse.
ELON MUSK SAVE US
&gt; on the same day that the Chinese government said it has met pollution-reduction targets for the year

Written here as if this necessarily makes a contradiction.
Well, I've decided to never visit China despite my interest in Asian culture. My asthma would destroy any enjoyment from the trip.
Have it bad in Shanghai at the moment but not as bad as Beijing. Terrible weather formation here with higher humidity and no air movement trapping a lot of smog =(

However, I will say that the pollution has been better managed this year than the past, noticeable downward shift in pollution once AQI index hits a high.
I'm sure that no one will see this nor care, but you never hear anything about India... I wonder why. http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/china-india-smog-rivalry-a-sign-of-global-menace/
Come to Canada, we'd love to have you! Plus we have all this land! With lots of trees and streams and mountains and shit.

Head over eh
562 as I post this. Well above 300.

http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/

This reminds me of how the Soviet Union had record crop yields every year, even as millions starved.
This has been one of the worst stretches I've seen. The aqi has gotten higher before but right now its 560 - that's absurd, and what's even crazier is how many people are walking around with no mask. I think maybe 5 of every hundred wear a mask, and only a few look effective.

Its infuriating and shows how ineffective the CCP is - can't run a stock market, can't clean their country, can't provide drinkable tap water, can't face America in the South China Sea, can only lie, brag, steal, and scream with indignation when someone points out their flaws. Worse, they've convinced people how great they are.

All you have to do is look outside to see who is China's biggest, most harmful enemy.

Despite claims of China of meeting pollution, environmental, and safety standards, actually the claims are just propaganda.  There needs to be more attention spent on examining what China is actually doing to directly lower carbon emissions.  They want to save face globally, but their economy depends on a lot of old policies and pollution pumping industry. It's too easy for China to say one thing and do another, that needs to change.
It's now 570... This is the highest I have ever personally experienced in Beijing. Holy crap. 
I just checked out a pollution surveillance map and in Dezhou its above 800. What the fuck.
Megacities have no choice, give up the use of fossil fuels or die in the smoke they create.
I cannot imagine how cancer will not be rampant there in time. Unless they literally create giant air filtration machines I cant see how this will get any better, especially as long as much of their energy is being met with dirty coal. 
hey guys. I live in Tianjin, which is right next to Beijing. This is my 11th year living here; I've practically grown up in China. It's a terrible thing to say but in my opinion people here are just used to pollution by this point. (or maybe it's a lack of awareness? I'm not sure which) The AQI was 515 this morning with a PM2 of 421 (which qualifies as hazardous according to http://aqicn.org/city/tianjin/) and I saw so many people walking around without masks and several guys smoking. My brother and I were literally the only ones I saw with masks on. As far as I know schools also remained open today (at least mine was)

Anyway, I really can't complain because once my dad had to take a taxi from the airport to our home which is on the other side of town when the AQI was about 800-900 a.k.a little to no visibility. 

By the way, I tried to check out the Bloomberg article and found a 404 error instead? Could it be the Great Firewall at work? 

They should have stayed freezing in winter and not burning fossil fuels, or better still all out on the farms scratching out an existence. 

Those were the days.
Seriously, what is being done to reduce this? 
I know that for alot of people living there, they can't help it...

But honestly,. how  can anyone choose to live to there, fi the yhave other choices?

Reading the comments about the pollution being INSIDE your house...and the pictures...christ. 


It's like a microcosm of what the world is doing with climate change.
I could never live there. I'd feel so claustrophobic I'd panic. 
A country so big....why not spread the industry a little bit. I understand saving costs, but at this point isn't the health problems going to cost extra?
Oh, now i get why they lifted the population control laws. They found a new form if it. Population control by pollution.
take a look under the top hat that i've carefully placed on my lap. lift it up and you'll see my boner. 
Mission Accomplished
I'm here right now. It is in  the 700s in some areas. We are waiting to see if it hits 800! Seriously, I would bet more people die in the next week of the high PM 2.5 levels in Beijing than the number of people that died in Paris from the ISIS attack.
live update. Seriously, it's nasty out there.

edit: for reference here's New York's AQI http://aqicn.org/city/usa/newyork/
my flight to Beijing was delayed till tomorrow.. which is already more than 24 hours late because the Nanyuan Airport in Beijing said the smog is so bad that no flights are allowed to land there.
The two aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.  Pollution hazard in a particular region on a particular day is strongly influenced by the ambient weather.  If Beijing got stuck under a blocking anticyclone, even pollution at a reduced rate will accumulate over days/weeks and create a problem.
I'm in Wuhan, I've lived here for 4 years and its actually definitely improved over that time. When I first came here the pollution was shocking. We still get random bad days sometimes, especially in Winter but this is one place where things seem to have gotten better.
Humans sure are resiliant. Always amazes me how much bad stuff it takes before people start collapsing en masse in the streets.
You're not gonna believe this OP but China can meet pollution standards as a country but have horrible pollution in one city. 
Man I can barely handle the high 200s (on the bad days) up here in Heilongjiang.  Stay inside, people of Beijing :(
Beijing government is just a bunch of liars... While I can understand why they are failing at fighting pollution they're just unable to admit it's .
Bill Burr has the answer but nobody has the balls to say it, nor do it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI0-rUHorj8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI0-rUHorj8)
You'd think this would be a wakeup call to the rest of the world to get off of oil and other polluting ways, but nope, money and power is more important than stopping pollution. 
Best part is as I'm walking to work through this shit this morning, wearing facemask &amp; all, I got elderly Chinese on the sidewalk burning piles of papers for their ancestors just adding more pointless smoke on top of it. 

I understand its part of the culture, but when its already so thick I can't see two blocks ahead of me, I'd think it would make one hesitant to subject oneself to even more smoke...
thats what happens when you pack 2/3 of the canadian population into a city
It is now 570..... This is the greatest I have ever personally experienced in Beijing. Holy crap.
Yeah, was in Beijing in 2013 and I really can't comprehend how Beijingese could cope with the haze and air pollution. Virtually no one was wearing face masks!
And people still believe our governments whyyyy ? 
400 is sad I though delhi was bad - it reaches 300 here in the these months.

very important paragraph on [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates):
&gt;The IARC and WHO designate airborne particulates a Group 1 carcinogen. Particulates are the deadliest form of air pollution due to their ability to penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing permanent DNA mutations, heart attacks, and premature death.[4] In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that **there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%.** The smaller PM2.5 were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3 as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs.
As someone who might go there some day: is wearing a mask sufficient for that kind of pollution? If so, any specific type?

I don't want to get insta-cancer ;( /joke
[http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/](http://aqicn.org/city/beijing/)

PM2.5 looks like it has been in the 600s for several days. I've seen it go as high as 814 while I was there last year. The sad part is that it's common for folks in China to open their windows and breathe the "fresh" outdoor air, as opposed to the "stale" indoor air.

[For reference](http://1.usa.gov/1lsLx3h) - PM2.5 levels of 150+ are considered unhealthy for adults in the US.


Yup. Those who moan about the US should take a quick trip to Asia to see what life without any pollution controls does  
Beijing is a trailing indicator.
Only on r/worldnews front page will you see two headlines both praising and condemning China for spending the most money on clean energy and for having hazardous city pollution levels
This is a form of natural selection
Don't worry, according to the Chinese prime minister, air pollution is a Western Problem.
It's funny how Western media is constantly shitting on China/Beijing for air pollution while India, just next door, is home to arguably the most polluted city in the world - New Delhi.

Here's the US Embassy air quality index for Delhi - http://newdelhi.usembassy.gov/airqualitydataemb.html

At the moment (1325 IST/ 0755 UTC) the AQI is 358, or 'Hazardous,' with a PM2.5 measurement of 308 μg/m^3. There is no rating worse than 'Hazardous' on the US embassy website, which stops monitoring above an AQI of 500. You also have to keep in mind that the US embassy (where the sensor is located) is in pretty much the nicest, greenest, least-crowded part of town, subject to very low vehicular traffic through most of the day. And let's not forget that this particular reading is taken at pretty much the best time of day — the morning rush is long over and the temperature is rising, taking a lot of air pollution off street level due to convection. It'll improve for another couple of hours, maybe even dip below hazardous, until around 1600h local time, when the shit will hit the fan again. From 1700-2300h, it's a crapshoot, as rush hour is followed immediately by a massive influx of commercial vehicles (mostly poorly-maintained diesel-powered trucks), which are banned from entering the city through most of the day.

A couple of days ago, one of the PM2.5 sensors in the city was recording levels it could not even measure — http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2015/11/29/pollution_2_n_8674732.html

And that's not the first time — I've seen it happen at least once before this month, when it was much warmer.

Even Indian data paints a terrible picture: http://safar.tropmet.res.in/map_data.php?for=current&amp;city_id=3

TL;DR - fuck China, India's where the real problem is at.
I wonder when or if we will see large portions of the population get lung cancer.  Like what if a whole generation just dies 20 years early?  I can't imagine the life expectancy is too high 
My friend and I are sitting in this coffee shop, both feeling really sick right now. It's like a toxic apocalypse outside. 
Something that really makes me to think about it seriously. It is growing day by day. We have to combat with this Air Pollution. 
But are any of you really concerned this time? Or are you just going to click the next link on the front page? 
Wow, I just realized that basically China's problem is that it treats its government the way we here in the US treat our biggest, most powerful industries. They both can do whatever the hell they want, regulate themselves, and then proudly tell the public what an excellent job they're doing!
Man, I've always wanted to go to China. I'm even studying 中文 right now. But I have asthma. I can't breathe in pollution like that. I can't go to a city that polluted. Damn china, get your shit together. It's a beautiful country with a beautiful culture, I hate to see it become a shithole.
I was in Delhi when the climate pledges come out of Paris next month.
I can't even fathom why these cities haven't been voluntarily evacuated yet. Having to be stuck inside your home wearing a breathing mask should only happen if you're at war.  
I'm thankful to be living in the land of the free and home of fresher air......Ahhhhh! Feel that crisp breeze.
Those living in Japan have to suffer from China's pollution :(.  
We should do something.
It's actually fucking disgusting.   
I can only think of 2 occasions where I have ever puked. One was eating too many frozen chicken nuggets, the other was stepping outside of the Beijing Airport. Felt sick immediately and puked once I got out of the car. 
Cancer in the air. Deep breaths everyone.
And people keep sitting here thinking their governments dont lie to them on a DAILY basis.  Im sorry, you sheepeople are delusional.   
Taiwan numba one!
And the UK is going in to business with a government that don't care about pollution or it's citizens. 

Seriously, they need to Fuck off
Quick question... does anyone *actually* believe anything the Chinese government says?
Taiwan #1
This is yet another reason why
TAIWAN NUMBER 1!!
haha I guess this is why they say TAIWAN NUMBA 1
ITT: People who think that you can just clean up all the pollution in China overnight.
Yeah, come over to Alberta where we still have a bit before coming back down.
Well yeah, in the rest of China maybe.
are we fighting a war on global warming &amp; losing the war on global pollution?  are they one in the same?  
Can someone ELI5, please. What has caused such a drastic increase in pollution? How bad is the pollution compared to Western Cities (NYC, London, Moscow, Berlin etc.)?
Welp, I guess those Chinese can play Fallout 4 : Smog expansion pack early :P
It has to be the coal plants.
Holy shit, in Toronto the AQI is at 25 while in some places there it's at above 800. Hard to even imagine.
I've a question that's only partly relevant, but I thought this thread would be a good place to ask:  
I've noticed a trend for people in the UK, who always appear to be Chinese or of Chinese descent, wearing face masks on the street.  
I didn't think pollution levels here were high enough to merit such precautions, so I'm wondering. Are people in, say Beijing, aware that the pollution levels in their cities are unusually high, and *that's* why they have to wear masks. Or are they led to believe that its a precaution everyone should observe.

How does this look like from space?
This shit happens all the time in Idaho where you'd imagine there would be fresh air. We get in inversion around Boise which holds in the traffic smoke which isn't too bad because there's not a ton of cats but then if you through in a wildfire on top oh that... Oh man that shit is just no fun. I've called in sick from work because I did not wanna go do manual labor outside in maximum warning level smoke shit. If u can't see the mountains I am staying inside unless it's to ride mountain bikes. Beside mountain bikes &gt; lungs.
Let's play Spot Beijing....

http://earth.nullschool.net/#current/chem/surface/level/overlay=cosc/orthographic=93.54,1.68,430
hazardous = 2nd highest alert? Whats the highest alert - when everybody is dead??
唉。。
"What? Zero is a target!"
met the targets when averaged across the country? sure. they've got pockets of pristine untouched wilderness to offset the cities. not a good way to live, but a good way to meet their targets.
About a year ago, I went to Baoding, in the Hebei province, which is one of the cities with most air pollution in the world. I swear to God that my age expectancy dropped about 5 years during the week that I was there. Your throat burns, your eyes burn, your nose burns. It's awful.
That is horrifying, hopefully the rest of the world takes note.
So are they corrupt OR was it so bad that it's still have a potential of getting dangerous?
A question to the engineers over here. Since circulation/flow of air seems to be the main issue here. Would having some large industrial sized air filters at different places in the city help solve this problem?? 
fyi, one thing you can be certain of is that whatever is the opposite of what the chinese government says is actually true.
I'm pretty sure China keeps meeting their "goals" of emissions because they look at intensity (per unit) and not the actual entire emission volume.
it's okey they can stay inside and learn to play lol
Chinese people of reddit, do you take your government serious over matters like this?
oh wow ouch
It bad today in Shanghai as well. Over 200 is not normal for us.
they need more cities, the bigger cities are bursting at the seams, people need to move out. They should start by moving offices outside these big cities
I'd love to visit China, but I worry that it would be like saying, "Hey, I think I'll smoke a pack of cigarettes every day for two weeks." 
at least they're honest about their intent to put industrial productivity before population health
中国北方不奇怪
Looks like we might lose China
Then it kind drifted up to react only when the reading of small steps and they all take a lot of hope following this summer but it will get much worse before it gets better.
London managed it after decades, I'm confident the Chinese will manage it too, hopefully soon
americas europe russia are the cause of climate change. They must stop using fossil fuels and bring down emissions.
Also, it might be non-native speaker...
I realize just picking up your life and moving isn't easy but I seriously could not live in places like this. It honestly sounds like an early death sentence when you are literally breathing in poison. 

Too hot, too cold, too rainy, too many people, too few people, etc.. - all those are annoyances that I can live with. But breathing in pollution every single day? Not cool. Not a chance. I'd sell everything and drive until the air clears up. 
What can these people do in terms of dealing their homes and filtering the air?
Cancer is a lot.
Serious question asked in hyperbole: What is the leading factor causing this? are there just endless tire fires getting bulk fed garbage to burn away or what? this sees comically dangerous.
This is just sad- development for the sake of development.

What about the quality of human lives, which is being ruined day by day?

These polluted cities need to have their factories implement better purification processes and cut down on CO2 emission by encouraging usage of cycles rather than motorized vehicles (traffic is rampant anyway). 
The three types of comments in this thread:

1. Fuck China's big fat liar ass!

2. It's not all their fault guys, we need to stop buying all this crap!

3. Hey guys, the air's pretty bad here too!
Can the rest of the world do anything to help / combat this issue? Why is China's pollution so overwhelming? I mean, we should be fighting this sort of thing like terrorism.  It's arguably more dangerous for the entire world.  What do we need to do? Anyone? 
They're switching old, outdated coal furnaces to natural gas powered ones in their restaurants bars or clubs.
So you're telling me that I *shouldn't* visit Beijing as the final stop of my honeymoon tour of Asia?
The human race fucking disgusts me.  

I know we are all just trying to get through our lives and a vast majority of people have no alternative options other than the power that is provided by their governments, but damn does it ever sting to know that we are manufacturing our own end with no hope in sight.
damn its dragon level threat in China now.
Not OP but I live in the air.
Alert goes to 11.
Just finished reading The Running Man. This is a bit close for comfort. 
That will work! So I guess children are not breathing home... 
Sick... dirty.... people, except for LA because Los Angeles has as much smog as Beijing... yea i lied
Has anyone tried this new pollution mask? I have heard they are really effective. http://o2canada.com/ 
What a surprise! Another fucked up communist five year plan!
lol Chinese gov lying? What?
Why do we put up with these Chinese cunts constantly polluting our world? Why don't the Chinese stop polluting? They need to otherwise they'll literally kill themselves, we don't want that...
Chinese lie. Every headline about China should start with that.

**Chinese lie: say they met pollution reduction targets**


**Chinese lie: Say no lead in your baby forumla**

and other common problem stemming from Chinese dishonesty.
This has all the makings of a good /r/nottheonion story.
And of course nobody realizes that this toxic fog *moves*.
The chinese lying? No way!
Despite all the efforts to fight against air pollution, there are still terrible days like this, it takes time, considering circulation of the atmosphere vary in different years, the decreasing pattern of AQI isn't linear, sometimes there will be relapse.

*sigh*, flying into Beijing next weekend.  anyone have extra masks they want to share?  or beers?
well, natural selection at work
I don't understand how can a coutry reach such point, and its government does not do anything about it.
There are times when pollution isn't "hazardous," in Beijing?
A notable portion of this shit winds up on the west coast of the U.S., unfortunately.
Shirow Masamune, prophet of the future...
And we're still focussing on Turkey and Russia FFS
i miss those days when my hometown still had blue sky
AQI 566 when I just checked. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/b0e6aMH.jpg) is what it looks like in Zhongguancun right now.
Air pollution is a hoax man! 
Just like London 100 years ago. Give China 100 years they can clean it up too.
I've been there numerous times over years. It's been proper fucked for a long time. You seriously can't breath there daily.
But I bet it makes for some beautiful sunrises and sunsets to the east and west.
It is particularly bad today but it's one area, seems plausible to me that China could still have made progress this year

The first time in 13 months is another way of saying the only time this year 

The first time in 13 months is another way of saying the only time this year
Just spent 4 weeks travelling all around China. No matter where you go, the smog is there. Rural or urban, remote or populated it's always there. Makes for very depressing landscapes...
We should get rid of the EPA, they just hurt businesses.  
Hurray Republicans
Damn, this thread has gotten me worried. I was planning on traveling to Beijing in January. How bad is the smog and how bad is it for your health? Should I change my travel plans?
India is more polluted than China. Yet the western media amplified China's pollution. Fuck the western media. 
[deleted]
My lecturer used to say that Chinas stats are so rigged its not even funny. The fact they have the worlds largest population and can release full economic statistics within two weeks of conducting a national census is almost impossible 
As if anyone believes anything the Chinese government says.
Trusting a bunch of Mao-heads to tell the truth...ever...lel
TAIWAN #1
Oh we're seeing articles about Chinese pollution again. Must be that time of year again. You know - the time we blame the Chinese as an excuse not to reduce our own greenhouse gasses.
[deleted]
ahh capitalism 
I was forced to stay in Beijing for a couple of days because of a flight delay last winter (Never take Air China).  From what I experienced, Beijing is a disgusting place that I will be glad to never step foot in again.
Ah...Let's see how many downvote I can get this time...China throwing a lot of money into green tech, not because they care about environment, but to prevent themselves died of smog.Cheer.
But didn't I just see on here China was leading the world in renewable energies and us sucks. 
It's crazy to think that such heavily polluted metropolises like Beijing will longer be hospitable to life without a hazard suit
You can't trust anything the "official" Chinese Government reports. Some estimates put their actual economic figures at least half of what they report. 
They are chanting "Pakistan, number one!" and "Pakistan, zindabad!" which is an Urdu expression of national pride and victory. This was six years ago and has absolutely nothing to do with Islam or the Paris attacks. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AActlAp7Ow
Shit like this only happens because people are too fucking dumb to check the validity of something before sharing it
these things are just idiot traps - if you know somebody that posted you have just found your local idiot.
We're all right back in post-9/11 world, having learned nothing. Feels so much like October 2001 right now...
People using this tragedy to push their own mis-guided political agenda is disgusting.

&gt; &amp;quot;Iran&amp;#039;s president Hassan Rouhani called the attacks a&amp;quot;crime against humanity&amp;quot; and Joko Widodo, the leader of Indonesia, the world&amp;#039;s most populous Muslim country, said his nation &amp;quot;condemns the violence that took place in Paris.

It is so frustrating to me how easily the general public can stop using common sense and stop questioning sources as soon as bad things happen.

This is the time to slow down. QUESTION SHIT! Wade through the garbage to find truth. Maintain your beliefs instead of slipping into the shitshow that humanity tends to be in moments when maintaining beliefs is most important.

There's going to be enough backlash against refugees and Muslims - no need to invent crap to create more.
A girl on facebook has taken to tagging me in various anti-Muslim, anti-refugee articles and videos because she has an issue with my stance on the refugee crisis. 

99 percent of the time the stuff she posts is from ultra conservative blogs, Christian news, stuff like that. I've started ignoring it. 


This last time she was extremely insistent that I watch the video, or otherwise admit that I was ignoring "facts" and blindly swallowing "a bunch of liberal propaganda". 

Knowing that the majority of what she posts is either extremely biased non-news or outright fabrication (like this video) I decided to watch it. She claimed it was a video if Syrian refugees in the Netherlands complaining about not Recieving flat screen tv's and threatening to go home if they didn't recieve more money. I was pretty confident that the video was probably not in English and that someone has transcribed it in an intentionally inflammatory way. 

Turned out that the link led to a blog where the author posted an image to look like a video, and completely fabricated a transcription below, saying that the video wasn't loading for "some people" and that he would just go ahead and transcribe it for them. 

When I presented her with this information, she mass tagged me in a bunch of videos from a website called "Jewtube" instead of responding. I just removed her. 


There's no possibility of a rational dialogue with these people. 
Same thing here happened in France. People were sharing a picture of immigrants at Calais around (what they called) a "celebratory bonfire" on Saturday.

Turns out it was just a fire that someone (probably in retaliation to the attacks) had started in their camp.

So many people think it's try.
This kind of journalistic disinformation just isn't cricket.
The terrorists want us to hate Islam. I won't fall for that shit. 
Bigots changing the narrative on a video to fit their own agenda?

I am Jack's complete lack of surprise.
Superpatriot-Facebook-uncle will be crushed. Can someone help me break the news to him?
I've now seen several instances of images/stories deliberately and falsely portraying Muslims "celebrating" these attacks. 

I'll be honest, I had thought most of the recent cries that Islam is being falsely portrayed, stereotyped, and targets of bigotry were not true and they were overstated.

Now, I do see that there are serious problems with how Islam is portrayed, and I think it's getting to the point of bigotry, racism, and religious intolerance of Islam.

I say that as an atheist who believes Islam is probably the biggest source of religiously motivated violence and bigotry itself, via its extremist elements, not the majority. That doesn't justify deliberately falsely portraying Muslims to further some bullshit storyline.

Edit: ok I get it, should've have said "racism". Pretty sure you're all picking up on the core point of my ideas here though.
[deleted]
There are way too many idiots on Facebook that believe everything people share. 
One IMPORTANT thing about terrorism from ISIS/DAESH.
They don't attack us because they don't like our way of living, our freedom, or whatever. 

They want to divide us, that the people hate muslims because of their religion so that they can have more people within our countries to fight. 

Everytime some dumb racist guy post such kind of videos, it's a victory for the terrorist because it's all what they want. CIVIL WAR or at least high tensions to fuel and export their fight everywhere and thus gain power everywhere.
The real question is: who's agenda is it to inflame relations with Muslims and why?
The fear and terror generated by the Paris attacks is exactly what the terrorists want.  Marginalizing Muslims and inciting racism and violence are their goals.  There are now mosques throughout the U.S. being vandalized with threats towards their congregations.  Again, this is EXACTLY what the terrorists intended.  The refugees are considered traitors  by ISIS and Assad; they would love nothing better than for those fleeing death to be ostracized and homeless.  The refugees are fleeing ISIS and Assad for their lives.


Reminds me of that John Oliver clip where they called CNN out when CNN showed the bus 'full of refugees from the migrant crisis' that was posted in years before this happened.
Cricket is a serious business.
Who the fuck is perpetuating these videos?
[creepy guy staring down the camera at a cricket game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9rCxZCYwOQ)
So... This is supposed to show bad integration of muslims in UK, while celebrating a cricket victory is like the most british thing you can do?
so this is a blatent example of media manipulation? which means that the terror attacks in france could have been done for reasons other than "yay isis?" idk why the media would try to spin it as something false in order to gain support for the "eliminate muslims" movement other than if all of this from 9/11 to today was about brainwashng an entire generation into believing muslims are terorists and we should be afraid and trust in our governemt. i just find alot of inconsitancies that make me lose trust. thats all.

Have us fight amongst each other that way we forget who the true enemy is.  

Hustlin baby!!

Every war when it comes, or before it comes. Is represented not as a war but as an act as self defence from a homicidal maniac. Or in the case a group.

Have no illusion we are headed to war. It has started. Not to sound negative but it's an inevitability. People will profit and people like us will lose. At least if I want to arm myself I can just rob a French military base for supplies. 
 
Who the fuck believed this in the first place? Have never heard of this video, except for posts like this.
[Fox News fucks it up again.](http://megynkelly.org/2015/11/14/watch-video-muslims-around-the-world-celebrate-the-jihad-victory-in-paris/)
Where do these videos come from?  It's a special kind of evil when an individual does this to incite a reaction.  Piece of shit.
Today:  bigots is dumb.  Also, man people like cricket. 
The most sickening thing is someone knew exactly what this was before spinning it to fulfill their narrative. What kind of disgusting person wants to rain hell on a group they hate so badly that they don't realize, 'They are celebrating a sports victory just like I would, maybe we're not so different.'. Instead they've decided they're just going to continue propagating hate and making this world worse.
It's amazing how the racists calling all Muslims barbaric are themselves rejecting the very values of the society that they think they are defending.

Daesh is Islam's barbarians. These racists faking footage and trying to encourage everyone to hate and kill minorities are our barbarians.
Does this mean we can condemn the Philadelpia Eagles as terrorists?
What kind of sick fucks do this?
Not that we should be unvigilant, I'm tired of all this fear mongering. People need to calm the fuck down, this is what ISIS wants us to do.
Where was this being circulated?
did anyone think it wasn't fake?

how ignorant do you have to be to think it was real?
So once again the people are r/conspiracy were right.
Oh my god. It's almost like some people are purposefully trying to make a large group of another people look like monsters to excuse their own racism/discrimination/whateverism against that group.
there are actually some crazy people downvoting this, i left for an hour and refreshed and it went from 8020 to 7950, i think we found the White IS1S people. Come on white people condemn them.
Propaganda doesn't need to be true. Just believable to people predisposed to already believe the message.
Pretty disgusting how someone out there even thought to use the video to try and get more people to hate muslims. Glad that its been exposed.
Lol omg my friend was the one in this video. Saw him posting about it on his news feeds the other day. He said it was a video of them  all celebrating the cricket match back in 2009, and that someone found it on youtube and decided to edit it in.

I think its scary how you can just get put into a situation like that.

Edit : his post the other day : http://imgur.com/FPw6xiT

Who's circulating this propaganda?
This was done in 2001 as well. Its a ruse my friends. Gaming the very system that so many believe in without a doubt. 
http://memoryholeblog.com/2015/11/17/brandon-turbeville-on-paris-1113-and-roots-of-false-flag-terror/

What pisses me off is that there are people out there who actually put the time and effort into creating these frauds, and knowingly circulate it.  

What pisses me off almost as much is the people who forward crap like this without taking a few minutes to Google first.

EDIT:

What pisses me off most is this conversation that happens every time I point it out to someone who reposted it:

&gt;ME:  "Dude, you know that image is faked.  Here's the original image and context.  So no, XXX did not do/say XXX."

&gt;THEM:  "Huh.  It doesn't matter, that's what they think anyway so it might as well be true."

&gt;ME:  *headdesk*
You mean a video that was created to spread hate turned out to be false in order to spread FUD like all of the news/pics and videos of the past?

Go figure...
Internet users are so shallow these days... Clickbaiting and sensationalised headlines have led people to not even question the things they read or see.
has/is someone going to trace where the false info arose from?
I never saw this floating around on social media.  Why do people go out of their way to lie about this stuff? Portraying such a positive thing from 2009 as being a celebration of terrorist acts is just asinine. Stupid internets.
If you're using the Paris attacks to push your own political agenda, you're doing the same thing as ISIS. Your hands, if not *covered* in blood, have been thoroughly -and willingly - dipped in the blood spilt by others. 
Saved for my relatives, because you know this will come up at thanksgiving.
Am I the only one unaware of this video *until* this post?
These people have already admitted they know it's fake [and they don't care](http://imgur.com/j43VdTp).
Saw this on facebook yesterday. http://puu.sh/ln3zt/56fe7f000e.png People are going crazy. The people in those pictures aren't even the same!
Well that won't matter. Tell a lie enough times and it becomes the truth. If you don't believe me, just ask Fox News. 
My Le Pen-loving family members in France also posted a video of youth supposedly rejoicing just after the Paris bombings in the métro. Also completely misattributed.
Fox just tried the same thing with the 'Terrorists Inbound?' train video that was actually from 2010.  Thanks John Oliver.   
That's the kind of fake video that would be highly upvoted in r/worldnews at the current time, unfortunately.
I find it ironic that people are claiming these men are expressing hatred towards the West are in actually peacefully celebrating their country's success in a global, Western-originating sport. Hell, we need more of these videos. These are the common fibers that can bring cultures together in shared passions. It's a video that shows a world getting ever so slightly smaller, and yet people are trying to pass it off as proof that there is a tearing apart into two irreconcilable worlds. 

Meanwhile, I'll bet the actual scenes on the ground are probably not so different from what happened in 9/11, a solemn shock and horror, even in those countries who are most adversarial.
As a [half] Pakistani and a Muslim -- who, like any other human being in their right mind, wants ISIS and all other terrorists to be wiped away and burn in hell -- this disgusts me. 

I am so, so glad someone bothered checking the background and evidence of it. I find it unbelievable that people would go to such extents to make a group of over 1 billion people look so inhuman just because we share the same religion. No, let me rephrase. The *name* of the same religion - not the actual beliefs.
Oh, how surprising, bigots are using irrelevant videos to justify their bigotry.
Great to see the majority of people here saying things like "shit like this happens because people are assholes" and defending the targeted, Muslim community.

Give yourselves a pat on the back.
The internet strikes again.
What video ? I am sorry I can't Ser it 
I think it's fucked up that people believed this in the first place
upvote pl0x
This is such a feeble attempt.  They may as well just use the "Monty Python Old Ladies Clapping" stock footage at this point when they want to try crap like this.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opT_JGssUVk
Who's the douche that made the video?
naw its real, trust me I'm a forensic geologist.
No shit
They played a blinder in that game, not happy about having to watch constant reminders that England have historically been rubbish at 20-20 cricket.. Viva Cricket ! down with the trolls!

What a shitty thing to try to do!
Lol... this sounds like something my white trash radical conservative uncle would repost on Facebook.
Yes ..
 This is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AActlAp7Ow

It's just so sick that people would malign a whole group for the actions of an extreme few. And now this...
Sad how bad some want to push their ass backwards agendas. This is being desperate at a very low level.
Clearly they wouldn't be stupid enough to celebrate in public.
You don't say, old fellow.
If you have to lie to prove a point then your point ain't worth shit
This kind of shit should get not just the original poster, but everyone who shares it, suspended from Facebook. No questions asked. It's not only evil as a form of propaganda but in this climate it encourages racialized violence against Muslims. 
Fear gives way to hate, hate gives way to bigotry and bigotry leads to stupidity.

There will always be the scared and uninformed who jump on something like this and spread it.
To the people faking footage like this:  ISIS and friends don't need your help to look shitty - you hurt your own cause by lying.
Get rekt ISIS and far right of anything and everything. 
Well done guys for a posting something that clears the air rather than igniting hate. Kudos. 
Whoever puts this shit out after a tragedy…. Here is an extra portion of Fuck you… You are NOT Helping!!!

But I just bought this giant pitchfork! Life isn't fair.
Wtf Media !
Yeah, there were a lot of stories about Chicago Muslims having parades on 9/11. I believed it at the time because I was hate filled and didn't have internet like today's where one can fact check that shit.


Wait, who would think that "Muslims" would celebrate a terror attack in the first place? That's the dumbest shit I've ever read.  

That's like Germans celebrating a Nazi terror attack.
Isnt this a crime? Using a carriage to Deliberate Incitie violence and facebook supported and delivered that incitement? ?
People are always saying to put the heroes on the news, not the criminals, because otherwise it only helps the criminals even more (they get press, other people see the reaction caused, more criminals follow suit).

Yet somehow, criminals continue to get all the press, and the heroes are not the ones remembered. 

Fuck the media, greedy fucks. 
They're a huge part of the reason why a lot of political problems are not resolved.
a spark of rationality amid flames, its never enough
Close enough right? 

/s
I'll just leave this here

http://youtu.be/pqip0u0oL5o
On a side note. That was a great match. The Afridi show. 
the fact people BELIEVED it, is a sign of pretty poor relations with muslims and the western world
Why do people create fake shit like this? 

This shit happens every time. What propaganda chief is digging up old footage and presenting it to the world as "____ Muslims celebrating _____ terror attacks"?
Western media pulled this same bullshit right after the Sept. 11th attacks.

"Oooh, look everyone! The Palestinians are CELEBRATING!!"

And it was just stock footage of some Arabs at a holiday celebration from several years past, completely unrelated to America or Americans. 

Same bullshit, different year.
The amount of racist assholes coming out of the woodwork after these attacks is staggering. Never let a good crisis go to waste I guess...
Its scary man. Im a Muslim living in Canada, and I cross the border into Detroit where I go to school. Been crossing 5 days a week back and forth for months now. Yesterday, first time crossing since Paris attacks, I get "randomly" selected for a search and had my vehicle searched inside-and-out. First time this has ever happened to me. The look on the border officers faces when they found my little Quran in the glove box and looked at me... Then I came home and saw people sharing on facebook a petition to stop Islamic Immigration in Canada... it all makes me so sad. I understand peoples reaction to Paris, ISIS and other Islamic radicals. They are mad and frustrated so Im fine with some hostility, it just worries me where it could lead. 

Edit: Also, want to point out that my problems are not a big deal, especially compared to those affected by the attacks like in Paris, Beirut and other countries, so Im not looking for sympathy. I just want to contribute to the conversation regarding how this situation is unfolding and how to deal with it going forward
I hope they go after every ignorant twat who shared that with a defamation suit. 
In what world are we living? RIP Media, RIP Humanity, RIP Peace and RIP common sense :(
Bigots are gonna bigot
Propaganda is probably the strongest weapon of a war.
The right wing is going to be churning out this kind of shit for months. Every time something like this happens, the right-wing fascist hate parties swell their membership.
Please keep an open mind about this.  The source could very well be a disgruntled, bigoted individual, or it could also very well be part of a covert intelligence agency's propaganda / disinformation apparatus,  in order to sway public opinions and push a geopolitical agenda.  Same can be said about the recent photo of the Sikh man holding an iPad and taking a selfie, which was Photoshopped with good care to make him look like a "terrorist" holding a Quran and wearing a suicide vest, which then went viral across social media and TV news.

I look forward to my neo-conservative uncle, who refuses to fact check anything, forwarding me a chain e-mail in a few months of the video of Muslims cheering the Paris attacks
Isis is trying to get Muslims to become corrupt. They are trying to do this by having the rest of society hate them. If people are making bullshit like this your just helping their cause 
probably one of the many Redditors inciting hate speech since the Paris attack
Here's some food for thought: Muslims themselves are the BIGGEST victims and haters of those assholes (terrorists/ISIS). Reason? These assholes have demolished, raped, and murdered (over 200k people in the Syria/Iraq to be exact) whole muslim villages in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and across the Middle East.. sold their women.. Terrorists have burnt down girls' schools in northern Pakistan, blew up hotels and marketplaces in Peshawar, Karachi and Islamabad.. Muslims are the ones with the MOST hate towards these assholes. Just google Zarb-E-Azb ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Zarb-e-Azb over 300 Pakistani soldiers have died).. the Pakistani offensive has greatly increased over the last 2 years (ever since these terrorists blew up a school in Peshawar.. killing 132 kids https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Peshawar_school_massacre ). If this was truly a religious agenda (going after "infidels").. how would that work? These guys are barbaric animals ready to kill anybody who comes in their way..regardless of race or religion. Alienating certain sects in the West who have just as much hate towards these terrorists is not the way to go.
http://i.imgur.com/hKxDCtb.gif?noredirect
This is getting ridiculous.  Between the guy whole took a selfie and had it photoshopped into a Koran with a suicide vest on and this, shits just going way too far.

Even in my local area a mosque has been broken into and another almost lit on fire.  A woman had her hijab ripped off and then punched in the stomach.

Seriously, persecution of people who in no way condone or participate in ISIS is just infuriating.
FFS. Are there so many idiots that we need people to debunk this nonsense?
We're stuck in a religious propaganda war created by rich war-peddlers.

On one side, you got the Muslims, on the other side, you have the Christians and the Jews.

Above all that though is the capitalists, the people pulling all the strings so the public is hating each other while these guys all cash in on everybody freaking out and letting these dicks have their war and fear and terror.

Fuck the lot of them.

There's a ton of this bullshit going around and it's not an accident that people are pushing this stuff because they have an agenda and they want people to react angrily so they can openly start a fucking war.
This same thing happened the week after 9/11 in the U.S.  Then, it was a soccer game.  The media  is a rogue branch of government who's job it is to pacify, polarize or beat the war drums when the time is right.  They are nothing but Reality TV show script writers who do more than just control the water-cooler dialogue.  They actively campaign for the war on your mind.
I'm so glad I don't have Facebook. 
Of course it's fake. It's very popular to believe Muslims are all hateful because of the actions of the few, but we must remember that they are first people, and that tragedy is tragedy to most people, regardless of their faith. Muslims, by and large, hate ISIS and all that it stands for.
Conservative propaganda to drum up fear of the Other? Big surprise.
Cricket. Buncha overdressed hooligans! 

(EDIT: The players, I mean)
Source criticism: popular everywhere. I see weekly people on facebook quoting The Onion as *fact*. 
Doesn't the media use fake images like this constantly? We seem to hear about this sort of bullshit anytime anything happens anywhere.
Whhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyy would someone post this and make shit up about it? Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.

*In the deadpan style of the McDonalds all-day breakfast tweet commercials.*
Fuck those people posting this as something else. You aren't exactly helping things, SHITHEAD.
Reminds me of the propaganda videos used after 9/11. They showed people cheering in the streets and I guess it was shot way before
This same propaganda was used after 9/11. The news media would show random kids in the middle east giving a V for victory sign and celebrating, and it ended up just being some soccer celebration iirc.
Facebook is an echo chamber that helps ignorant people stay ignorant.
But, I want to be outraged...

/s
Didn't some idiots claim people were celebrating 9/11, and showed celebration footage that turned out to be clipped from a middle eastern wedding?
Can the people who started this be sued for libel by the people in the video?
surprise, surprise Western Media misusing stock footage of a group of muslim people and suggesting it's "terrorist propaganda"...shocker.
It seems as if this post is more popular than the so-called video.

"A-ha gotcha ring-wingers!"
If anyone knows the original FB poster please report it. This is the met police [TW acc](https://twitter.com/metpoliceuk) 

http://content.met.police.uk/Home

Well of course its fake. Who the heck actually thought anything like that could actually take place anywhere outside of Daesh controlled territory?
They should track down who started this and they should be arrested for disturbing the peace. 
And this is why they teach us to criticize every source we use in school
Ahh, Facebook...where intelligent dialogue goes to die.
Yeah, but cricket is an abomination.
Alot of videos showing "syrian refugees" attacking civilians were actually from kurdish-turkish infighting. The notorious swiss couple getting beaten on a road comes to mind. I said this to one user who keept posting it on /r/worldnews ofc he never responded
The video shows how few people are desperate to defame Muslims and they are even ready to do such a fraud for their purpose. 
ITT: bigots
This is getting too funny now... looks like the same shit fills up the zeitgeist every time a terror attack happens.

Fake passports laid out at the scene... some Muslims celebrating... Israel saying "now you know what we deal with"... real estate targeted involved in some shady deal... almost like a blueprint of sorts.
I remember this kind of thing happening a lot during 9/11. Every time I tried to explain it I was written off as a "terrorist sympathizer" 
I have literally never seen this video until now. 

Literally nobody I know would blindly accept this as being anti French. 

Anyone dumb enough *to* believe such a thing wouldn't be much of a threat to anyone anyway given their stunted intellectual capability.  

People just find videos like this and purposefully manufacture this 'outrage' to divert the discussion. 

...and you fuckers fall for it. every. fucking. time.

Maybe one moron shared this video and said some dumb shit? Who the fuck cares. He's a fucking moron. Why would anyone assume that *everyone* would believe him?

Don't be fucking retarded reddit.

ITT: The rebirth of Islamaphobia.
Sadly, people will willingly choose to believe they were celebrating the attack, because that's their worldview... that's the world they believe in.
The same exact thing occurred just after 9/11.  News media was all over it and sensationalizing some video of Palestinians cheering in the streets.  Turned out to be some stock footage from some other non-terror related event.
If you see someone harassing or persecuting innocent Muslim folks, report them as **aiding and abetting ISIS**.

Bc they are giving ISIS what they want: more persecuted and fearful Muslims to join their cause.

These racist fucks are no different than ISIS. None.
It was posted on the internet , must be true! smh...
ignorance is a bliss, for the media.
Am I in 2001 again?
So you're saying they have been planning these attacks for six years?
How soon before some Republican presidential candidate, governor, mayor, congressional representative, or recently elected dog catcher mentions this "victory video" as compelling proof of the Islamic takeover of Europe and another stealth move in the Islamic takeover of America and the installation of Sharia courts all over America by next Tuesday. 
I thought everything on the internet was true. Disappointed
It's like they've never heard of source criticism
Its amazing how much fake shit gets spread on facebook, and how many people share it believing it to be true. 
This sounds like the hunger games loop of District 13.
I am glad no one I know as posted this vile shit. 
What is fact checking.....

 
More people took it seriously though than are in the video
How can a person even think it's not a fake...
Which century are we living in?
How would anybody think this is real though?
Lmfao
I am happy to see that still people are there to support common Muslims who don't have anything with terrorism and extremism.
So the [prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXUZjyZVj6s)                is coming true? 
Dumb, uneducated racists are ignorant, lie and spread obviously wrong propaganda. A totally new concept, who would have known?

/s
But don't let that interrupt a good circlejerk on Facebook!
Isn't 90% of internet stuff fake these days?
Cnn did this so many times after 9-11 with fake celebration videos from Palestine.  This is fucking disgusting...
Man, people who make these fake videos are pieces of shit.
/r/nottheonion
Remember when CNN kept playing that video of Palestinians celebrating a football match right after 9/11?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavMtUWDBTM&amp;
disgusting animals
The only use I get out of these things is I can find out who I no longer wish to be friends with based on whether they start spouting nonsense about "MUSLIMS MATE, FUCKING MUSLIMS"
Seriously, the observation that there are bullshit postings of videos on the Internet deserves gold? 
I remember when they said Donald trump wanted to deport Mexicans and a fake picture was released saying he wants to deport black people as well. A girl on my Instagram took advantage, mixed her problems and emotions then started sharing the fake picture to talk shit under it.  
I could have told you the video was fake and/or taken out of context even without confirmation. You would have to be an idiot of elephantine proportions to publicly demonstrate in celebration of a terror attack anywhere in the western world.
I always check reddit before I check Facebook (I rarely spend time on Facebook now). But, I am going to put 5:1 odds that one of my uncles has posted this...
Should we be as tough with these fear spreading idiots ?!
[But I was already protesting!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2FAyOY0jWA)
As always, some people are trying spread hate and divide. 
Whoever decided to knowingly start sharing this fake is a terrible person. 
It doesn't matter if it is exposed. The initial reaction sticks with a lot of people and the truth gets ignored when it is brought to light later on. 
Were the people who put out that video just trying to enrage people?
I'm sure there's some celebrations going on between some of the extremists, they're just not drawing attention to themselves.
Can Dundar is arguably the most celebrated journalist in Turkey and the editor-in-chief of one of the main opposition newspapers. There was a large [protest](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/28/world/europe/thousands-protest-arrest-of-2-turkish-journalists-on-spying-charges.html?_r=0) in Istanbul two days ago against the arrest of the two journalists. This put some pressure on the ruling party which led to several prominent members condemning the arrest and saying that freedom of the press should be respected. In the end, none of this is going to stop Erdogan and his posse from attempting to mute any and all opposition. He's basically got the judiciary in his back pocket so there isn't too much doubt about whether such charges against his opponents will hold up. 
By charging them with espionage and not slander they are essentially admitting supporting Syrian militants, is it not ?
[deleted]
I thought Turkey was publicly funding the rebels. Are they not? 
You gotta love the government. If you do something illegal, you go to prison. If you *see* them do something illegal, you go to prison.
This is outrageous. Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey 149th out of 180 in its 2015 press freedom index last month, warning of a “dangerous surge in censorship”. I hope NATO will talk to their "Ally" because this is really getting scary. All freedom of speech is being shut down! Erdoğan is an Islamist hardliner, and everybody knows it.
ISIS thanks Turkey for "humanitarian aid"


All these moves by our government that make us look like we support  stupid terrorists and it names our country as anti democratic more. Last 5 years, i am ashamed  about what we done to democracy. I really get sick of erdogan every day more.
This week, on another exciting episode of European Collapse:

* Bank robbers take family hostage in France. "Relax, we aren't ze terrorists! Also, don't relax, but give us ze damn monet!"
* Socialist Prime Minister takes office in Portugal. "Give us some of that sweet Greek bailout, Brussels!"
* Sweden to tighten rules for asylum seekers: will now only allow in one jihadist per 100,000 refugees.
* Free speech in the land of Voltaire? Suuure... Just don't say something the French government doesn't like, in a time and place that's inconvenient to them, and you're good!
* Poroshenko decides that Ukraine is a big, stronk, independent country who don't need no Russian gas. Will the politician's hot air be enough to heat his people this winter?
* And finally, in a strange but not-unexpected turn of events: Erdogan shoots down Russian jet, Kurdish lawyer, and decades of tolerant secularism... but Obama pardons Turkey!

Will Europe survive another tumultuous week? Tune in next week to the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/europeancollapse) to find out!
Thats what the CIA do all the time
Does anybody know WHICH group of Syrian militants these trucks were going to?   Was it ISIS or Assad? Or some other group?  Syrian militants is kind of a broad category.
last time i heard they were against things Russia does, now looks like they learn from them.
[They should have used emergency laws to do whatever they wish, just like the French](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/nov/27/paris-climate-activists-put-under-house-arrest-using-emergency-laws)
Thank goodness we would never do anything like this.  We only punish evil spies like that Snowden character.  /s
The "fuck Erdogan" mentality is understandable, but is this really something specific to Erdogan?

If a journalist in any country published information about the intelligence agency's ongoing mission, would they not face similar charges? If I had a video of the CIA doing something similar, would they not come to me and insist that I don't publish it? And if I still published it, would I not be punished for it?

Hell, if I stood outside the CIA headquarters with a camera pointed at them I'm sure someone would be with me momentarily. 

This just seems like standard "don't let our enemies known when, what, where, and how we are currently doing things". Especially since it's pretty well known that countries like Turkey and the US are openly arming rebels.
Fuck that worm Erdogan and all the corruption. They don't deserve our tourism money or the EU nod. 

Having said that I am a little sick of this subreddit only running anti-Turkeu articles after the Russian plane was downed. We get it.  They're dirty. Next item. 
I might be missing something here, but how is this different from any other country in the world?

If the CIA was providing arms to Venezuelan militants or MI6 was providing arms to Libyan militants and some plucky journalists published non-vetted articles documenting it, wouldn't american/british journalists also be jailed? 

Seriously, leaking government secrets (especially ones this sensitive) is generally considered espionage around the globe.
Man, you gotta pay for oil somehow
So what is Turkey doing different than any other country in the hierarchy of stuff that can get you jailed for a moment; if you decided to go take pictures of the press.
Do you expect anything less from a state that openly support terrorist with munitions and arms in return for illicit oil
Bit *which* Syrian militants?

The US is supplying "Syrian militants" with weapons as well.
If Saudi Arabia is ISIS, does that mean that USA is Turkey?
Erdogan probably has himself convinced that Allah acted in his favor.
The journalists published it immediately after Erdogan announced that he'll resign if Putin can provide one evidence that the Turkish government is arming ISIS. Now this happened.
Fuck Turkey, as an Australian, we still remember Gallipolli, so Fuck You
I suppose the reason for that was that the first world war going on at the journalists and tell everyone they are actively fighting.
There was a post of this maybe a day or two ago, I think on a different subreddit. So is this a x-post, or is there updated information or what?
That's the base response that humans are hard wired to fall back on during periods of extreme pressure or harm. Breaking away from that is the only way to move forward
Are we trying to get the middle east into a massive shooting war? 
They both did the morally right thing, but he was in a just world he would be one which put a bullet in Erdogans head.
My favorite; "willingly aiding an armed group" charges ....... Against the journalists .... NOT the people literally providing aid to an armed group, but the people reporting it. I had to read that a couple time to make sure I wasn't confusing something. 

Of course remember our WW1 soldiers but that is another story.
What city does the Euronews journalist's accent come from?
Is that good or bad? I've lost count of who's the good guys now. WHO THE FUCK SHOULD I BE CHEERING FOR PEOPLE!?
In US, we demand the release of the journalists and grant their freedom of speech.
Entire middle east is a cluster fuck and has been for way too long now
"If the media is silenced, no-one would know what was right or what was wrong. This is another step forward for the fascist dictatorship"

And France is making "conspiracy theories" illegal. Of course, they get to decide what is, and what isn't, a conspiracy theory...

http://www.voltairenet.org/article187030.html


Honest investigative journalists are an essential vanguard for peace and freedom in every country in the world.
Erdogan probably has himself convinced that Allah acted in his favor.
No wonder they weren't accepting any refugees despite having loads of available sites, its because they were fueling the misery...
Qatar brings these supplies to Turkey nearly weekly by aircraft to be trucked in.
Read the title quickly and thought I was reading about Saudi Arabia; holy shit Turkey.
Turkey wtf
Being in the Thanksgiving state of mind, I read the title as they were dressed up in 'turkey face'.
IN the military that's pretty high up in the world is fucked no matter the situation.
So Turkey and Russia are on the same side now or...?
Where is the video?
If the trucks were transporting humanitarian aid things, what were the things?
Where is the video of the humanitarian aid things?
Turkey is directly arming and supporting Al Qaeda. Why does NATO do nothing about this?

The coalition of the willing invaded Iraq over the pretense that Iraq supported Al Qaeda when it didn't. We have solid proof that Turkey IS supporting Al Qaeda and no one bats an eye. 

I truly respect the honest Turks who are standing up to this islamofascist regime and it's sultan Erdogan. 
Man, you gotta pay for oil somehow
I guess it is *espionage* to document activities that Tayyip Erdogan, and the rest of the Turkish government, are publicly denying to the rest of the world.
But doesnt the government they wanted.
You call them militants, some call them freedom fighters
Where can I actually find video of Turkey arming the Syrian militants?
Link to video?
They're going to live freely.
Edrogan admitted that those 'aid' trucks were actually for the Free Syrian Army. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3urfyv/erdo%C4%9Fan_says_intercepted_mit_trucks_were_going_to/
I can't believe how stupid the Europeans are. They just handed Erdogan 5 billion Euros so he can try and stem the flow of migrants. In the meantime, he's the biggest despot in the region.
Using state owned vehicles to do something illegal/unpopular does not sound like a very intelligent plan. Why would the Turkish intelligence do it? Is it that hard to get nondescript generic vehicles?
I don't if this is because I'm an immigrant from turkey and adapted since I was 11 but wtf. I read the turkish news every day and the country going to hell. how the fuck can the people who live there still support this. How the fuck does this Party get 51%?

What a load of crap.  Turkey is on the spotlight for suppoting terrorism.  what better way of accusing  someone  else 
Turkey seems a bit like Saudi Arabia.
Merkel wants Turkey as a part of European Union, the silliest idea ever   they would blown up the nation within couple of years.
A little over a year ago an American female journalist was on a story about basically this, and was killed in a very suspicious traffic accident where her car was obliterated by a large truck just a few miles from the Turkey/Syrian border.
Speznaz rescue when?
Is it 2014 yet?
Support the secularist forces, why are we arming fanatics. The US is wrong. 
Fuck Turkey.
The journalists published it immediately after Erdogan announced that he'll resign if Putin can provide one evidence that the Turkish government is arming ISIS. Now this happened.
After Gaddafi was overthrown, the Libyan armories were looted, and massive quantities of weapons were sent by the Libyan rebels to Syria. **The weapons, which included anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles were smuggled into Syria through Turkey, a NATO ally.** The times of London [reported on the arrival of the shipment](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/middleeast/article3537770.ece) on **September 14th, 2012**. (Secondary confirmation in [this NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/world/africa/in-a-turnabout-syria-rebels-get-libyan-weapons.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0)) This was just three days after Ambassador Chris Stevens was killed by the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi. Chris Stevens had served as the [U.S. government's liaison to the Libyan rebels since](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/03/us-names-chris-stevens-liaison-to-libyan-opposition/) April of 2011.

While a great deal media attention has focused on the fact that the State Department did not provide adequate security at the consulate, and was slow to send assistance when the attack started, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Seymour Hersh [released an article in April of 2014](http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n08/seymour-m-hersh/the-red-line-and-the-rat-line) which exposed a classified agreement between the CIA, **Turkey** and the Syrian rebels to create what was referred to as a "rat line". The "rat line" was covert network used to channel weapons and ammunition from Libya, **through southern turkey and across the Syrian border**. Funding was provided by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar.

With Stevens dead any [direct U.S. involvement in that arms shipment](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-syria-heavy-weapons-jihadists-2012-10) was buried, and Washington would continue to claim that they had not sent heavy weaponry into Syria.

[Do you want to know more?](http://stormcloudsgathering.com/the-covert-origins-of-isis)
Fuck turkey
Erdogan constantly asks for proof when confronted with Turkey's role in supplying terrorists with aid. How can any sort of evidence be provided when he's arresting/liquidating all of the journalists in the country?
The West as a whole supports militants. For some reason Turkey is getting the most shit for it though. Anyway I'd rather support militants than Assad.
When will the west admit that Turkey is not an ally but working directly to protect ISIS.
Turkey's current government is acting like villains in a Bond movie.
"Syrian militants" .... they mean ISIS. Turkey's ruling class is in bed with ISIS.
Just more proof that turkey and nato are the dirty party in this fight. Sucks when the people pulling this countrys governments strings are the bad guys. Makes me feel bad. Corruption so high and so obvious seems truly global.
Fuck Turkey and anyone else supporting these terrorists. I hope Russia sends in unmarked commandos to assassinate these corrupt fuckers.
Turkey really needs the "get it together, or GTFO" talk from Nato.

Now a covert operation which I would support would be one which put a bullet in Erdogans head. It would probably save Turkey from its slow slide into fascism with the death of one shitty man. 
here is the response from the FSA:

"Russia Deliberately Bombs Relief Convoys and Syrian Civilians"

http://en.etilaf.org/all-news/news/russia-deliberately-bombs-relief-convoys-and-syrian-civilians.html


So is this why turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet? To cover this up? 
-
Sucks when the people pulling this countrys governments strings are the dirty party in this fight.
Wait until Obama finds out! He's going to 



Get mad at the journalists and tell everyone they are with ISIS.
"We're gonna go ahead and send a shitload of ammo to Syria with these huge trucks that can be easily identified as property of our government. But don't tape it! Nobody can know! It's secret!"
This is like the propaganda from that battlestar Galactica movie. The only good terrorist is a dead terrorist
-Gandalf
But at the end, the president turns out to be a bug himself.
It's really the means at which one accesses information. Data isn't given to journalists in confidence and therefore not held accountable. Snowden worked for the government, so leaking privileged information can be seen as treason/espionage. I support Snowden, but one was trusted in confidence while the other is not.

The Saudi Daesh of Turkish Arabia
Turkey's joining the Saudis in exporting violent Wahhabism. Directly or indirectly they're supporting groups like ISIS and Al-Nusra and we tolerate them as a member of NATO.
How come they aren't mentioning that female journalist that was murdered after uncovering this story before these two?
It's funny how I got down voted for saying Turkey won't admit to the Armenian Genocide, then more and more stories like this comes to light.. is this what you Turks really want/support?

Your government should be ashamed of itself

Kill over a million Armenians, and just fuckin' deny it.. kill a Russian pilot for literally NO reason, and celebrate it.. fucking animals

I am not the only one in favor of dropping a bomb on their heads
And Merkel wants to bring Turkey into the EU
looks like turkey is back on the menu, boys

-putin
Oh the Turkish government denied the claims, it must be real, plus how dare you tell the world that turkey supports terrorism?????? In any case Russia are destroying any trucks that are coming from or leaving turkey.
Yada Yada Turkey Yada yada
&gt;[**@Reuters: BREAKING: Islamic State claims responsibility for Paris attacks in official statement**](https://twitter.com/reuters/status/665481654148964352)
If they're saying this is an act of war this quickly then France are almost certainly about to invoke article 5. 
Just a reminder, i see a lot of people talking about Charlie Hebdo but remember about the train guys! That train where 2 americans arested a terrorist could have been even worse, he had a AK47 in a train in movement, i just want to point out that this is not the first major terrorist atack of 2015 in france, an it is not the second either.
This is big. You have the president of France calling out the Islamic State. How will the UN react? How will the French military react? Whatever it takes to put these bastards out of commission.
Looks like I'll be deploying somewhere soon. 
The first curfew in Paris last night since the Nazis invaded the city. Think about that...
So, before everyone gets too exited about a NATO intervention against ISIS on the ground. There is a reason we haven't done it already. 

The Syrian conflict is immensely complex, there are over a 1000 armed groups in Syria and Iraq. We can not stop ISIS without a solution for the entire Syria. Sure, we could capture some villages and cities in the shorter term, but the US tried for 14 years to eradicate the talibans and stil without success. Just superiour military might is not enough. As long as the conflict continues ISIS will have plenty of opportunities to recruit people, and a more direct western involvment might just lead to increased radicalization.

Military action might be needed, but a long term solution means rebuilding tarnished countries, finding fair compromises for all minorities in the middle east, and creating hope and opportunities by educating and creating jobs for the middle class.
So, does that mean that NATO member Turkey will stop supporting ISIS with money, arms, training, and medical care? Will France call out Qatar, Saudis, and Turkey for ISIS support? Would Qatar lose the world cup because of clandestine ISIS support? Would Saudi Arabia lose ability to finance mosques in the West? Would EU members fix their border policy? Would European countries continue to vote against Israel at the UN and for countries like Saudi Arabia to head human rights council? Will Western politicians be investigated for receiving Saudi money? Would doing so to allow Saudi-financed mosques to continue indoctrination into Wahhabism be considered treason? Would people who come back to EU after fighting for ISIS in Syria be arrested or deported? Would Muslim hate preachers and ISIS sympathizers lose their residency and benefits? What would actually change?

Yeah, I thought so.

Most of those are from "leftist" Guardian. Reading what the "rightists" write will make you depressed.
I'm going to play a little Devils Advocate here.

When we "go to war" with IS.. how long are you all going to support it this time? I'm seeing a lot of anger and motivation to go to war in this thread with no plan, no real idea what the hell to do. Just send more allied lives to do... what exactly? 

Sure.. we (the US) may have fucked up with the whole "WMD" thing.. but Iraq was always second to Afghanistan, just as finding WMD's was second to eradicating AQ/Taliban. Just follow where SOF goes for the "real" fight. 

Support for fighting terrorism has been on a steep decline and it seems like everyone has cried out to bring our troops home and to get out of those other countries. And now everyones like lets go back because they fucked with us. Let me be clear: They never stopped fucking with us. Nor will they.

When it comes to a group like the IS you can't just take them for their word or any of that non-sense. Any 'smart' terrorist in the world is going to sit back and laugh and love the fact they you all point to an organization that in reality, doesn't really exist. Sure you can argue that they have some leadership and some form of chain of command, but they are terrorists. Terrorism can be anyone or anything. To group it all under one roof is a bad idea. You want to kill ISIS? Pssh.. some form will just pop up under another name with the same ideals or even different ideals, but they'll still be terrorists. Just like AQ/Taliban has diminished, they create a new group to gain more support and recruit more people. Same thing would happen.. well.. same thing will happen I should say.

I HOPE, oh do I hope, this gets a lot of people in this country (the US) to understand why it is we do what we do sometimes. A lot of the thing the military does, really, truly, should not be advertised and spoken of. Terrorists massacre 130 of our allies and we massacre 1000's of them and people cheer and love it because to us, our beliefs are the right ones. 

This is why we help train forces in counter insurgency and why we have different roles of Special Operations. Army SF/CIA/JSOC has been in the Middle East and Horn of Africa FOREVER, whether you know it or not. When we say "we're putting boots on the ground", if you really truly think that's the first time the American military is there.. boy you are so wrong it's crazy. It takes years to train many of these countries militaries and the tribal forces living there.

Someone in this thread got the answer right on the head, just like most things, education needs to be of the utmost importance here. Religion needs to be changed and education needs to be spread. It NEEDS to happen. Everybody wants peace and things like this to stop, but when you put labels on people and call it "religion" you are IMMEDIATELY separating people into different groups. Just like in our country (the USA), we want everyone to agree and to be Americans as a whole, yet when it comes time to vote, you declare yourself Blue or Red. Yet you FAIL to understand that doing this IMMEDIATELY separates the country into two groups. I guess maybe I'm the one that's not educated enough....

I find it rather funny (not the right word) nobody speaks of Oil when something like this happens.

Note: again, I'm playing devils advocate here. I want the people responsible for things like this to be shown the wrath of hell and be exterminated just like the rest of you. 
The FN factory is gonna be in full gear
And still the same politicians lining up to tell us how horrible this all is, like we can't see it for ourselves, are the same people prostrating themselves for the extreme islam exporters of Saudi and Qatar. They are part of the problem not the solution.

Cut these muderers off at the source and start dealing with those that fund and encourage extremist views. We need alternatives to their oil anyway.

Maybe ISIS should study history a bit more. The last time France, Great Britain, Russia and USA had a common foe they waged war on the results were rather spectacular. 
Yesterday, [Forces operating in Syria] liberated a good amount of territory from ISIS.

https://www.reddit.com/r/syriancivilwar/comments/3skkns/offensive_to_liberate_shingal_by_peshmerga_pkk/

Take their territory, isolate them, then end them.

&gt;Operation Free Sinjar (#FreeSinjar), supervised by President Masoud Barzani and supported by the International Coalition, concluded at approximately 1500hrs on 13 November 2015 as Peshmerga forces successfully reached Sinjar town.

&gt;Operation Free Sinjar achieved its primary objectives: to cordon off Sinjar town, disrupt Highway 47 from East and West Sinjar, and create a buffer zone.

&gt;In the course of the two-day operation, 28 villages were retaken from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL); more than 300 terrorists were killed by Peshmerga forces and Coalition warplanes, and over 200 square kilometres were cleared and returned to the Kurdistan Region.

&gt;Peshmerga forces have now established defensive positions in four major intersections connecting to Sinjar, including Ba'aj-Sinjar, Bulayj-Sinjar and Shababit. This will limit ISIL freedom of movement and to its ability to send reinforcements and supplies between Iraq and Syria.

&gt;Counter-IED teams will continue to clear the heavily-mined area while Peshmerga forces create defensive positions.

&gt;Over 40 local, regional and international media outlets in print, television and Internet were invited and embedded with Peshmerga units across the fronts in preparation for this operation.

Cool documentary about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO3iXNtLkug
It actually is concerning considering how many times ISIS has made these kinds of threats in the past against many major cities in Europe and the US.  No doubt some of them are planning to perpetrate something else right now too.

But ISIS should be the ones worrying and this may be why their "caliph" hasn't gone out of his way to claim responsibility.  The Kurds in Iraq have launched an enormous operation to cut the lines between Mosul and the ISIS "capital" of Raqqa and the Syrian regime has had significant success in recent days against them too.  On their own, ISIS would probably be done for by summer of next year; they can only imagine how much sooner their demise is going to be after what has happened.
This is so fucked up. Somehow I can see this go very very wrong
This mass surveillance that first world countries have been passing is a waste of money. Nobody heard any chatter before this, after all these systems in place? What a waste.
Why are ISIS targeting France over lets say america or now Russia 
As a guy from Russia, it is so strange for me to see the amount of passion and empathy put for people of Paris, but most population of Earth not giving a fuck about airplane crush where 200+ people were killed (flight from Egypt to Moscow) caused by terrorist attack from IS . It feels kinda unfair to see all the support Paris gets from all over the world and my country getting none. Can somebody explain why is it like that? But all that i know for sure is that it sucks, that at least 7 terrorist attacks have happened to developed countries over the last three weeks, god bless all the souls that have suffered from it. 
Almost all of the suicide bombings and massacres are perpetrated by Sunni radical Islamist.
ISIS is a Sunni political entity seeking of absolute power using radical religious ideology as alibi for its heinous crimes against humanity. Its command structure are mostly Baathist (Saddam’s old party) and ethnic Turkmen. Turkmens, Turks (attacks in Turke target Kurds), other Sunni Arab population aren't targeted by ISIS.

As things stand, proxy interests aside, the only two sides actively fighting ISIS are Kurds and Syrian government. Kurdish motivation is not to end ISIS, but rather protect its people (Yazidis and Sunni Kurds) and its territories. Syrian government’s fight is aimed to reclaim all Syrian land. As a result, ISIS is free and unchallenged in much of its territory as Iraqi governments fight against ISIS lacks intent. This gives them freedom and time to operate comfortably; ISIS is not on the run.

The west and the world needs to declare war and sweep through the Sunni lands between Syria and Iraq, starting in Syria. Syrian territory needs to be re-claimed and secured by Syria’s ruling party. After Iraqi territory has been swept, Iraq should be split into three countries as Biden proposed; Kurds, Sunni Arabs &amp; Turkmen, Shiite Arabs. The Sunni Arab population is where ISIS draws its support from and needs to have self-determination through as an independent state to avoid sympathy towards extreme ideologies. 

For this, I feel the following steps are absolutely vital:

* Saudi Arabia needs to actively crack down on intolerant radical Islamic rhetoric in forms of Salafism &amp; Wahabism. Such establishments and their activities need to be banished.

* Kurds should be armed and supported internationally and militarily to establish their own state in Iraq and Syria. 

* US and the west needs to move past our differences and improve relationship and trust with Iran. We might not like the way they run their country, nevertheless it’s a stable country under rule. 

* US and the west need to stop investing in the fall of Assad. He is no Saddam and should be ruling Syria.

* Turkish government needs to be unequivocally reprimanded their amicable views and passiveness towards Sunni militancy and their counterproductive witch-hunt against the Kurds.  

The world is bleeding because of these a**holes' ambitions for power and their incapacity to build healthy productive lives and society on their lands.
Serious comment/question. The vacuum of power left in Iraq allowed for IS to grow, if the allied forces can wipe out IS from Iraq, why not back the Kurdish people to govern Iraq? They are the largest people group without a state and their Peshmerga forces have been the lead army on the ground fighting IS.
Can't help but think that these acts of terrorism are slowly uniting the world.
The amount of possible outcomes from this announcement scares me the most out of this whole situation.  Let us all support each other in these coming days no matter where our fates will bring us.
I get the strong impression that the UN mobilizing forces and heading to syria waving 'FUCK THE MUSLIM' flags is exactly what IS wants. I could be wrong but I strongly suspect that was the whole point of these attacks. 
So IS has shot down a civilian plane (killing 220+) and killed 160+ people in a massacre.

Many wars have been started for much less, right?
How do you declare war on a group that has no legitimate sovereignty? 
It's a good thing that the intent of these attacks wasn't to draw out western forces and perpetuate conflict. If that was the case, we'd be playing right into their hands. Good thing it's not.
As a religious Muslim here I really do want ALL of these shitheads to die and not just die, be tortured. Seriously I'm tired of the "terrorist" joke, 14 of my personal friends died to the the terror attack on Peshawar school last year. I'm tired of terrorists ruining this earth. Seriously I want them to suffer in hell for the pain they have cause my family and me personally. Did you know i was evacuated from my home town where I grew up (swat valley Pakistan) because the shitty talibans who ruined my family, killed dozens of me friends, and put my town in the shit with all the bombs. Do you think I would ever support these shit heads? When they have done more to me than you can ever imagine. My number one hope is that they all die and live a painful eternity. I hate the fact that basically ruined my life and I'm seen as one of them, when I probably have the most hatred towards them than most people can imagine. Imagine 12 of your friends dying, 7 family members, leaving your home because it was destroyed, never seeing your home town again and being homeless for two years because you left everything behind. 
I do not understand why Muslims refuse to accept there is something inherently flawed with Islam. I am a Hindu and I accept how screwed up the caste system is. But there is a lot of open dialogue and people trying to break the shackles of caste system.  
Acceptance is the first step towards reform. Why cannot Muslims do that?
Its being reported that at least one of the attackers was a Syrian refugee who came through Greece and was waiting for amnesty in France.  


http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/nov/14/paris-terror-attacks-attackers-dead-mass-killing-live-updates



What are the viable military tactics NATO can employ to avoid another Iraq? 

I can't see how the retaliation will just end in disaster and create a new generation of IS. Unless we educate the young ones in the teachings of great peaceful minds, science and literature, and help them see the bigger picture, i can't see how the situation can change. 

What are the options? Totally conquering and taking control? Anything but that? I don't know. 
Fuck ISIS 
I would be very nervous if I were a non-radical Muslim right now, especially in France. Non-radical Muslims should be working harder than anyone else to stop the radicals among them. These radicals are going to force countries to take radical measures to stop them which will affect all Muslims, like internment. To me it seems like non-radical Muslims step up and help more.
I would really like to go to war with these fucks but I don't trust our governments not to repeat the last 13 years over again.
Armchair historian and hard line moderate here, because the truth of a matter is often somewhere in the middle. Problem is, I don’t see the middle here. I really don't. When I study the history of a conflict, I do my best to see the point of view of both sides, what their desires and wishes were. And whether I agree with the methods or not, I get what the Algerians wanted in 1954. I get what the IRA wanted during The Troubles. I get what the Palestinians want today. These things are clear to me, even obvious. But I don’t understand what ISIS wants or how it even hopes to accomplish their stated goal of an Islamic state. It’s all just brutal, bloody mayhem and the senseless death of innocents. An extremist Islamic state in the middle of a region that’s already predominantly Muslim? That’s like the KKK suddenly saying they’re in charge of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming. It’s just ludicrous and it doesn’t even make any sort of geopolitical sense to boot. It’s not going to happen, ISIS. Get over yourselves. You’re already getting the place you come from bombed on the regular and that’s about to increase triple fold. If that’s the objective, like Al Qaeda before you, then mission accomplished. But you won’t win an actual ground war and you know it. And you’re going to hurt more people than you can possibly imagine with this, even your own families, your own children. How does that make you feel?

If nothing else, you’re just further proof that we need to keep religion out of everything but religion. Keep your faith and your beliefs to yourself, whatever it is. This goes for everybody. It’s enough already. There may be a spirit and there may be a light and there’s obviously more to this life than what we can see and understand today and that’s amazing. That’s actually miraculous. But don’t go give it a name in your image based on YOUR flawed understanding of it and then start KILLING other people just because you think your imaginary friend told you to. What does that help anything? That’s not God or Muhammad or the spirit telling you to do that, that’s just YOU. You and your ego and nothing more.

Just fucking stop. Everybody who thinks this way. Please stop. The rest of us have had more than enough.

Not trying to be that guy but seriously...

Fuck religion.
RIP to all of those who lost their lives. Could've just as easily been one of us had we been in Paris. DEATH TO ISIS (preferably as prolonged and painful as possible) 
Tired of social justice warriors talking about Islamaphobia as if its more of problem than actual terrorism. I'm going to be scared of whatever the fuck I want, thank you very much.

It's not my job to adjust my fears to suit for progressive agenda. Its people's responsibility to make themselves less scary, or dissociate themselves from movements that do scary things. 
This sounds like a job for the Foreign Legion
If France goes to war, the US better stand next to them 100%. We need to support our allies in this. Fuck the people who say 'But France didn't go to war in Iraq and support US!' This is one of the clearest acts of aggression we will see in this modern age. The full force of the US military better be showing up if France puts boots on the ground against ISIS.
Whatever comes next I hope we come out of this whole ordeal as better men.
We must completely wipe out, destroy, annihilate whoever is funding, training, and arming ISIS. 
Didn't IS also claim to down that Russian plane? Wouldn't really believe them yet. They'd probably just take credit for every terrorist attack towards a western country.
When ISIS said that they have soldiers masked as refugees entering Europe freely, did anyone take a second guess and think that it might be true?
Good, an admittance of guilt, take the fight back to them. Hope I get to see every ISIS member dead in my lifetime. 
I bet the recruitment in the French Foreign Legion is going to skyrocket. Lots of foreigners are going to want some of that ISIS ass.
I feel like aomething else is going to happen during the holiday season. I hope I'm wrong.
We eliminated small pox.... We can eliminate radical Islam. 
For better or worse, we already know what works in this part of the world. A strongman dictator like Assad or Hussein. We need to put in action a program to strengthen Assad and find a replacement for Hussein. What ended up replacing them isn't even any better for the people there, and they were more interested in maintaining control over their territory than picking international fights. All the "Death to America" shit they put out is for local consumption and for this purpose, they know what would happen if they actually tried to start something.
some of you guys think this is a fucking video game. "hurr durr just bomb ISIS and problem solved!!!"

fuck sake 
I'm so tired of this. To the people who read into the politics and history of whats going on before making their judgements, I salute you. You are a better person than me. My opinion is, everyone can fuck off.

I just want to earn a living and raise a family. A roof, a car, the occasional holiday. I am a member of the faceless/nameless masses who just wants to get on with life. But for some reason there are opposing groups of people telling me I should support their decision to kill people. I don't fucking care what the reason is. There always seems to be a great reason to kill a group of people who have done nothing. 

Great. We got Jihadi John, Bin Laden, Saddam, bunch of other evildoers. But there is always an even longer list of dead innocents. These people who were murdered in Paris. What wrong did they do? Who did they hurt? Now more innocents are going to perish in their names. The biggest body count is always the faceless/nameless masses.

I'm not interested in hearing reasons for killing people any more. I'm not going to hate muslims, christians, people with different skin tone, homosexuals, rich, poor, refugees, immigrants or any other group of people. If you're someone who wants to live a peaceful life, I love you and I'm on you're side. 
ISIS just is asking to be killed.  Should have been done a long time ago.  
ISIS claims they are a state.  Let's invoke NATO's Article V.  Attack on one nation is an attack on all of them.  Let's get this done.
If Islam is peaceful, then why aren't the extremists extremely peaceful? 
We were told that terrorists will be mixed in with refugees but nobody listened, anyone who asked for heavy border control because they don't feel safe, were told to shut up and stop being racist.

I can't see this being the only attack in Europe, we need to act fast and have heavier restrictions when allowing refugees into the countries. 
Guessing the whole open borders idea needs to be re-examined, plus more on-call security armed response units (police, gendarmes, private).  Europe needs to figure out who all these refugees are and who are the sympathizers (these weapons just didn't pop up).. Of course, IS needs to get really bombed (Woolsie, a former CIA director, mentioned the bombing sortie were off by 100s compared to the Balkans, etc..).
its almost like the terrorists wanted this to happen
It is disturbing the amount of Islamic apologists and "these aren't the true Muslim" crap going around.  That's half of what I have been reading on comment sections this morning.  They're more concerned over their religion then the deaths of hundreds.
Syrian passport found on body of 1 of the suicide bombers near 'Stade de France' stadium, police say - @AP
Stop being afraid of calling the Islamic terrorists. That's what these rats are - Muslim fanatics. The world needs to unify and rally against these demonic fucks 
I subscribe to Al Jazeera on Facebook and as soon as the first report came out, hundreds of muslims were commenting saying things like: "it was the jews", "it was the US government", "it was radical christians", "Islam is peace". These scumbags can't even admit that people within their disgusting religion would ever do things like this. I unliked the page. 
It's just like the Joker said.

See, every single day, thousands of people are murdered, maimed and tortured by assorted armed forces, but no one bats an eye, because it takes place "where it's supposed to happen".

It's all "part of the plan". Even if the plan is horrifying!

But shoot at a mere hundred or so people where it is not expected, and suddenly everyone loses their mind!
Islam does not belong in the west
This is what IS wants. They want western governments to declare war on them. It frames the conflict in terms they can sell and gives them legitimacy.
I would have preferred the words "these bastards are late to their own funeral. We're going to see that they don't miss it."
Time to help France release freedom all over ISIS 
This is a clusterfuck of religion and cult-like behavior. Fuck everyone who believes it's okay or honorable to kill innocent people in the name of God.
Ignorant question here, but does ISIS have a command structure to properly attribute blame or does it operate more like Anonymous, which a bunch of loosely-joined cabals operating independently? 
War eh? As soon as body bags start getting sent home I get the feeling public support for this war will quickly change.
I am usually very anti war. But. If we decide to go to war with Isis, they need to go all out. No 10 year war. Strike fast and strike hard. 
 
Why do people think that marches of solidarity makes a difference?

The "Je suis Charlie" campaign did nothing.

There is a growing cancer that is crippling developed nations.  And here we are marching, singing, and holding hands.

So lets see...

We are already doing small drone strikes in Syria basically backing the Rebels and occasionally hitting IS.

Russia is in Syria blowing supporting the President and occasionally blowing up IS.

Now France (probably NATO which means the US on an official level) is in there after IS... 

Turkey us about to be caught in a rock and a hard place...

Is that right? Is this seriously about to happen????
I'd love an opportunity to kill one of these ISIS mo'fers.
so are they closing the borders now???
When is the time gonna come that the world decides to put their full effort into eliminating isis and anyone affiliated with then?
ISIS makes Al-Qaeda look like the teletubbies.

It's likely France will increase the airstrikes and possibly authorise special forces to operate more in Syria and N Iraq against the ISIS threat

However most of the work for France will be to look at itself, at it's own nationals, at the domestic radicalisation, and the movement of arms and dangerous individuals through Europe, also to increase intelligence gathering

ISIS wants Western ground forces to commit to Syria - that's one of it's stated aims and world leaders are well aware of it

I want nothing more than the eradication of ISIS (as with most of you), but France is already at war with ISIS.

It's just that instead of fighting ISIS troops and bombing their fighters, the ISIS turned the tables this time. This is hardly an unprovoked situation.

I hope this time around, the French will learn their lesson and fully commit to destroying ISIS instead of using them for their own objectives (i.e. justifying surveillance, ousting Assad)
War is exactly what IS wants. Should we give them what they want?
And Canada is about to let 25 thousand Syrian Muslim refugees in so I will blame the government not the terrorists when it happens here. For it is the bleeding hearts and irresponsible government that is positioning my country top become the victim of similar attacks. I don't care if im labelled racist. I do not want Muslim refugees entering my country. Call me whatever. I could care less, just do not let them in FFS.
Does anybody feel that carpet bombing Syria might have been an act of war as well? And happening before the Paris thing no less. 


Bring on the down votes 
I want to see American, French, and Russian special forces tag teaming the shit in Syria and crushing ISIS to death. Put a foot down on their neck and break it. 
all you hypocrites still hate Israel? Israel was never the problem, the problem is Islam and its very clear just look at the middle east, the muslim states constant wars and proxy wars and terrorist groups all driven by "Holy Koran", Israel is just unlucky to be surrounded by millions of those crazy fanatics 
I said the same in another thread, this attack was inevitable. The whole of Europe opened up its borders without a moments notice people protested ''let the refugees in''. Not saying that all middle eastern refugees are bad but in this day and age you can't trust people, Hungary didn't want refugees at the start but then had a change of heart and decided to let them through as long as they were checked and traceable. You know the thanks they got ? The refugees then stormed the border and rioted because they didn't like it. I'm probably going to ridiculed  for this post but i think its time we stand up and say enough is enough. If the middle east wants our help they'll have to earn it and until then I say we shut our borders and be done with it. The wars in the middle east are a lost cause they're has been fighting going on for hundreds of years all over the same thing. We as Europe need to look out for our own unfortunately we can't be the world's police some things are best left alone.
It's time to end this. We cannot allow this to continue. 

Syria must be invaded and conquered, and will become the new republic of France. It cannot be allowed to carry on. 

These radical fuckwits need to be dealt with swiftly and brutally. There must be zero mercy. These fucking whackos want to see the other side so badly? Then let's fucking send them there. 

Allahu akbar, huh? Then I hope he devours ISIS fucking black souls for all eternity. The ones responsible for this WILL regret their decision. 
Bashar Al-Assad is going to get blamed for this too. Stupid imbeciles and some people here are too stupid to realize that the "Free Syrian Army" are ISIS and Bashar has been fighting these rats since 2011. 
What did they expected for letting those terrorists in. It's like they're asking for it. 
Seriously, I just can't get my head around with their religion. They can do honor killing to their own daughters that was raped to avoid bringing shame to their family, but they won't do honor killing to those suck fucks that brought their entire religion into shame and discrimination?  &amp;nbsp;  
WTF?  &amp;nbsp;  
Muslims need to work harder to earn my respect.  &amp;nbsp;  
Fix you own religion's problem and stop giving others excuses to look down on you.
This is an act of war. All of Europe should declare it cooperatively.

Germany, England, Spain, Italy, Norway, Sweden, etc...this your fight, too.

If I'm French I want fundamentalist Islam banned first thing tomorrow. The new immigration test is to draw a picture and eat some bacon.

Tearing up as I type this. For the people in Paris who woke up today, in their own home, fearing for their lives and that of loved ones. I'm shit scared about what's to come from both sides of the fence. 
Dude, they declared war on you and all of the West years ago.  Haven't you been paying attention?  It's 9/11 all over again.  A terrorist leader makes some vague threats in a desert somewhere and we all laugh it off like he's just some nutjob.

It's time we start blaming Islam itself.  
Things are looking pretty bleak for all those migrants streaming to Europe

Wouldn't be shocked to see all countries borders start becoming Iron Curtains and not taking anymore chances on Isis infiltration 
Islam is not compatible with western culture. As long as there are muslims there will be this problem. Religion is shit.. ALL religions are shit. Islam is simply counter all progress humanity has made and no one should tolerate that.


This is scary.
China has backed the french. So now IS has the attention of Russia, USA and China... let the extermination begin!
This is all dumb. Declaring war on ISIS and attacking them in Syria isn't the fix. France needs to remove these scum from their country. 
Gunman confirmed to be Syrian refugee who arrived via boat trip to Greece.

What now bleeding heart leftists?
Weird how when it happens to another country they react the same way we did.
IS should be ruthlessly wiped out, no Graves for these subhuman pieces of shit, just deep ditches.
this is sad and all, but nothing is gonna happen.. there will be a memorial, the president will say France will survive, then everybody will forget about it until they do it again next month
I think its time to add the Muslim religion to rhe list of organizations that promote terrorism 
This is scary to me. What is everyone going to declare war on?

Let's say there's a huge coalition campaign, and ISIS is destroyed (at the cost of 1,000s of lives)--what then? You're fighting an *ideology*, held by marginalized people who feel that the reason for their marginalization is influence from outside (Western) meddlers.

This is an endless fixture that can (and has) been used to manipulate policy against us back home, much like the "war" on drugs has. We're taking the wrong approach here. I wish there were more discussions on causes/remedies other than who needs to be killed/bombed.
And now, Syrians have occupied Europe by the millions. What a mess. 
Please let this be it.

Let this be the moment a NATO member enacts Article 5 and wipes these assholes out.

All you apologist, do nothing, racism obsessed, let our people get slaughtered and politely go about your day redditors can cry a river. You fucking people care more about your internet porn privacy then you do the real threats in this world.
[deleted]
I'm not a patriotic person. I'm largely anti-military, and pretty anti-war. Hell, a lot of the time, I'm pretty anti-USA. But I'm so fucking tired of ISIS that I could shit. This isn't Bush invading Iraq because he had incorrect third party information about weaponry and was using terrorism as a false front for a reason to do it. This is a group of people attacking everything civilized in the world in order to start a war, all in the name of religion. I've had it. I've had it with the beheadings, I've had it with the temples being blown up, I've had it with the historic, priceless artifacts being destroyed for being false idols. I've had it. It's time to shut them down.
And people already forgot, a huge train attack was thwarted ONLY because France got lucky that some Marines caught the guy right before he was about to slaughter people.  People also forgot that they caught terrorists in Belgium with a huge cache of weapons right in the nick of time, *but they weren't successful at nabbing all if the sleepers from that terror cell*. Where are they now? What happens when luck runs out?  We'd be taking about 1000 murders since Charlie Hedbo.  

How many more have to be killed for the sake of DIEversity to appease SJW tolerance crap and out of fear of PC bullshit?  Europe has an uncontollable cancer in their borders. 
"We won't have that feeling of permanency that we had before. We've learned a hard truth.  That there's no end to misery and destruction. You cut the head off a snake, and it grows another one. You cut that one off, and you find another. You can't kill it, because it's something within ourselves. You can call it the enemy if you want to, but it's part of us; we're all men."  -Robert Mitcham in "The Enemy Below"


Canada is bringing in 25-35,000 refugees from Syria, I'm not thrilled about the idea since half of those could be ISIS infiltration and then we could have this very same type of attack happen in a few years on Canadian soil.  ugh.
And a war by muslims. You can keep naming these groups, but the fact remains we are at war with Islam. You might not believe it, but trust me, they sure do.
The worst part is that all the Muslims say "ISIS aren't Muslims, a real Muslim would never"... never what??? read their own fucking holy text that says over and over to do exactly this? 
This is totally unrelated to the immigration crisis at all. We should let in more muslims and africans to Europe you guys, check your privilege. Especially young, fighting age men. Come on, what are you, a racist?
Can you actually offically declare war on a state you don't even recognise as existing?
Is anyone really surprised by this?
We need to wipe out the source of all this terrorism and the biggest fund of terrorism all over the world and that is Saudi Arabia.

Instead we are best friends with them.... WTF?

Sell France a shitload of drones and turn them loose on Islam.
Attacking innocent civilians going about their day. How brave of you, ISIS. Cowards. 
At this point I just want us to glass (edit: the land formerly know as) Syria.
Looks like we are going to war boys!
It's all good. Vladimir Putin will do all the dirty work. No fucks given while sitting back in his chair, smoking a cigarette, laughing....
Now they will have Russia and Europe coming after them. WWIII seems to be shaping up.
How does France, with or without NATO (probably with if they invoke Article 5), fight a war with ISIS? How do you fight a war against soldiers who are not only willing to die but seemingly very keen to do so? How do you fight a war against an army, if you can call ISIS an army, who can recruit soldiers from inside every country fighting against them? I'm not up on the Koran but isn't there some prophecy about Islam defeating a great infidel army in the desert somewhere? ISIS want this confrontation because they can't lose in a conventional way and it fulfills some Armageddon type prophecy they've clearly been dreaming about fulfilling. This would be a 'war' like no other in history. 

How is ISIS going to be dealt with?
ISIS always knew they were at war, the western world just woke up to that fact. 
I don't think you know what I mean...

Eliminate, not chase away.  Inflammatory cleric?  Dead.  Hear about extremist activity?  Reported and the perpetrator is immediately dealt with.

Saddam was really good at this.

It is gonna be ugly, but this is definitely the needs of the many outweighing the needs of the few.  You swiftly and brutally make examples of extremists.  There's no trial....there's no appeal.  You don't get to promote hatred in a civilized society...you either play within society's rules, or you don't exist anymore.

It's sucks...its brutal.  I don't like the idea...at all...I'm for the most part a pacifist far left winger, but if the Muslim world does not clean house on its own, they need to not be surprised when someone comes and just burns down the house.
So a train derailed in France with multiple fatalities just minutes ago, I wonder if it's connected to these attacks
Fuck em up France!
It's a war alright, but it's more complicated than a conventional war. Bombing the hell out of Syrian and Iraqi towns or deserts that ISIS fighters are supposedly holed up at won't solve the problem as I'm afraid both ISIS and Al Qaida seems to have many sleeper cells in western cities. If you consider the bombing in Ankara last month, the bombing of Russian airliner in Egypt, suicide bombing attack in Beirut and the Paris attacks, it looks like this might turn into global scale urban terrorism/warfare and every nation must commit to this war against this islamist terrorist army, the US, the UK, Russia, everyone. 
man why do these people exist

it's like they're forever stuck in the acting out phase of teenage
Mabe now the world will do somthing about daesh

Sucks that it takes good people dieing to wake people up.
Why is everyone still calling then Islamic state. I thought all the leaders agreed to call then by the name they use themselves daesh?
This is how America felt about 9/11. I feel that France is completely justified in using military force in response to these attacks but remember that the road ahead is long and bloody. When you call for war, understand everything that it entails. Escalation of violence, amputees and unintended civilian casualties. God bless the people of France and good luck!
Wow how unexpected, nobody saw this coming.
I am anxious to see if these killers came in with the refugees. My country is going to be letting in 25k (or trying) by the years end, I don't imagine it would go over well if that were the case. 
I read last night that this was rhetoric more then anything, and yet most of the links on the front page seem to be implying that article V is about to be invoked. Daesh is a disgusting group of people, and I'd love to see them gone, but every time something like this happens it's very striking how much the hivemind as a whole seems to want more war..

The French military is only about 215,000 thousand active duty service members and another 28,000 reservists, plus about 85,000 Gendarmerie. If they do intend to put boots on the ground against ISIS they are definitely going to need manpower from a number of other nations. 
What a shitshow this is going to be
From one of the interviews with a concert survivor, "then I saw two young men, no older then 25, with Kalashnikovs." It's abhorrent how adult men can take pliable kids and mold them into monsters.
So, French is going to war?
I honestly don't see how you can go to war with IS?
You'd kinda have to destroy any country with anyone who believes or has the opportunity to believe the ideology, which is a lot of, if not all countries. 
Well.. I'm pretty sure these kind of conflicts will be a thing for the rest of my life.
Watching the videos of this disaster was just awful and scary. You could sense the fear. Horrible and absolutely disgusting 

Good. Now maybe the world will wake up, but I doubt it. No one has been serious about stopping ISIS yet. We will see what happens next, but Europe are still letting in hundreds of thousands of refugees without vetting any of them. One of the suicide bombers in the Paris attacks was confirmed [as a Syrian refugee](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11995541/Paris-terror-attacks-isil-suspects-arrests-victims-live.html) that came through Greece. 
A good first step in the counter offensive would be telling Saudi Arabia to stop funding terrorists and terror schools.
The scary thing about this compared to 9/11 is that it could happen again tomorrow. Stealing planes was pretty much a one time thing.
france needs to have an honest reflection on their immigration policies. i've always been an admirer of islamic civilizations, just remember the arab empires in the middle east were much more open to religion and other people than christian civilizations were and were a bastion of knowledge and scientific advancement, and understand that this islamic extremism thing is a fairly new post world war 2 phenomena but appreciation and acceptance of a culture is different from the responsibility a government has for keeping its citizens safe. unrestrained immigrations has never been a good thing. since opening up its borders sweden has turned from one of the safest countries in europe to the rape capital of the west, with rape increasing by over 1000%. france has been plagued with riots and refugees that refuse to immigrate, granted they did a shitty job of integration, but again unrestrained immigration without a plan is a bad idea. people need to understand that immigration is a privilege not a right and no country has the responsibility to let refugees in, it is a benevolent thing that shouldnt be demonized when it is stopped.
Which means that France now recognizes the Islamic State as such. Interesting.
I dont think all were from ISIS !!! The victims told the press that the terrorists spoke french fluent with no accent. So, the grew up in france and became radical by fundamental islamic french community and of course from ISIS
Fuck ISIS 
I don't trust our impotent governments in Europe can protect us anymore. We have to protect ourselves and our families.
Serious question. Why doesn't everyone currently fighting ISIS just do one huge attack, sending everything at them (artillery, airstrikes, boots on the ground, armor) and wipe out most of them? I remember something like that was planned, but never heard about that ever again on here. 

I get ISIS is an ideology that you can't really wipe out, similar to how we still have nazi's today, but those assholes in ISIS think they're winning and we aren't showing them that they have no chance. 
Syrian passport found on body of 1 of the suicide bombers near 'Stade de France' stadium, police say - @AP
This is the sad reality. If 1% of 800,000 refugees are radicalized that's 8,000 potential terrorists  too many. I can't see how this will end peacefully. 
Time to send the French Foreign Legion.
Turkey promises to do their part to defeat ~~Kurds~~ ISIS
For better or for worse, I get the feeling NATO is about to oblige their wish.
What ISIS really wants An in depth examination
www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkH3bWmxaWI
NATO please just end these barbaric monsters already. They choose to be monsters. We must choose to be the ones who slay the monsters. 
Turkey will be on the firing line soon. They have supported ISIS for far to long and its time that we give them an ultimatum: Either you are with us or against us.
Enough with the bleeding hearts and their irrelevant pleas for patience. Let's go finish these monsters off. 
Ugh this thread turned into a "hate Turkey for supporting ISIS" thread without any factual evidence.      
         
Fact is Turkey is since July engaged heavily into anti-ISIS operations and since the start of the Civil war Turkey has supported refugees and Syrian opposition. 

&gt;Turkey also provided refuge for Syrian dissidents. Syrian opposition activists convened in Istanbul in May to discuss regime change,[3] and Turkey hosts the head of the Free Syrian Army, Colonel Riad al-Asaad.[4] Turkey has become increasingly hostile to the Assad government's policies and has encouraged reconciliation among dissident factions.      
          
The only thing Turkey isn't to fond of is supporting Kurds, and Kurds themselves aren't to fond of supporting Turkey.
France bombing ISIS in Syria isn't an act oft war? Note: I'm not defending ISIS
Hundreds of thousands of unknown unsecured people walking freely across Europe and now this, i am sorry for losses but cannot say i am shocked it happened.
This is war, whether we like it or not, and it's a war which has been going on since 2001. It won't end until one side gives up. We ought to make sure that side isn't us.
I said it once, I'll say it again: fuck Islam!
That was to be expected when Merkel calls for everyone to come join them in their paradise in Germany, forcing EU countries to open their borders and ignore procedures.

Which resulted in the perfect opportunity for IS terrorists to enter Europe incognito.

But when people pointed that out it was ignored and even laughed at.
It was just silly claims and racism....

16% of French Citizens Support ISIS, Poll Finds
BY MADELINE GRANT 8/26/14 AT 12:49 PM
Islamic State

     
FILED UNDER: World, ISIS, Islamic State, France, Britain
One in six French citizens sympathises with the Islamist militant group ISIS, also known as Islamic State, a poll released this week found.

The poll of European attitudes towards the group, carried out by ICM for Russian news agency Rossiya Segodnya, revealed that 16% of French citizens have a positive opinion of ISIS. This percentage increases among younger respondents, spiking at 27% for those aged 18-24.
The survey also tested attitudes in Britain and Germany and found that 7% of British citizens responded favourably to ISIS. However, UK polling showed an inverse demographic trend to that of France, with support for ISIS rising with age. 4% of 18-24-year-olds saying they either strongly or somewhat support ISIS, compared to 6% of 24-35-year-olds surveyed and 11% of 35-44-year-olds. Positive attitudes to ISIS in Germany showed less divergence, remaining between 3% and 4% for all age groups.
ISIS downs Russian plane killing civilians and claiming their behind it. Everyone goes meh, there's no real proof. 

ISIS attacks Paris, claims they did it. Everyone loses their minds. 
Three days of mourning pfft - what y'all need is three days of purging the refugees and trash from your borders.
Who would have thought? You blindly let people in your countries that are escaping from a terrorist group, you are going to have a bad time. It's just like the U.S. boarder with Mexico. Cartel members are going to come across too. You can't stop bad people breaking the law, that's what defines them as bad people.
Islam needs to be eradicated. Bad ideas need to be challenged.


Middle eastern gays, atheists, christians and apostates aren't the ones doing the bombings and the terror attacks, it's the islamic followers.


Until we all agree that it isn't fundamentalist islam that's the problem, and that it's the fundamentals of Islam, then they'll continue to kill innocent people until we get our heads out of the sand to tackle the islamic terror that appears to be destabilizing the world.
War is upon Europe, whether Europe wishes it or not. Recognizing that early, is the only thing that will save it.
They just need to go in and wipe them the fuck out. Mass cleaning. I know this sounds rude but that's my honest opinion. 
Garenteed these terrorists come from a mosque funded by Saudi Arabia, we seem to be back at square one: not actually going to war with Saudi Arabia.
Im quite sure we will have a 3rd war soon
They probably have more assets in places in France and throughout Europe ready for activation, that's why they threaten even more attacks. 

Where is all the anti-terrorism police right now? Are they even doing their job? 
This is what we need those raptors for in Jurassic World - to infiltrate and destroy ISIS
Why do Muslims declare war on a country that welcomed them in? 
Before even reading one article about the attacks, one could guess it was Muslims. No surprise. Fuck the Middle East.

Something to remind ourselves since it is only 9 days since November 5, Mr. Creedy asks V "Why won't you die?!" V replies "Behind this mask, there is more than flesh there is more than bone. Behind this mask, there is an idea. And, Mr. Creedy, ideas are bulletproof." As long as there is one nutcase who buys into insane ideology there will be problems. You can kill a million extremists but a million more will only take their place. The solution lies in confronting the sources of what is driving young men to willingly give their lives to harm innocents. Is it poverty? Vengeance? A sense of injustice toward the world? I don't know, but religious fervor only seems to be a veneer. Plenty  of normal Muslims just want to live their lives in peace without harming anyone so just blaming religion seems a cop out. To stop ISIS and groups like them, we need to confront the idea behind the mask, not the men wearing it.
Careful france. the "war on terror" isnt all its cracked up to be. 
Religion is just a tool some are using to manipulate others. Anyone still entertaining Abrahamic death cults In their minds Is opening themselves up to be contolled and used. Its like having a leash connected to your brain that can be picked up by anyone who knows how to wield it. 

This is not just about Islam or even extremism. Its about humans controlling other humans and tricking them into hurting each other using emotional stimuli at the expense of rational thought. As long as we continue to prize faith over doubt and put fealty into religion over acceptance of science and reason, bloodshed will continue to have a higher chance of happening. 

Education is key. We need to educate the entire planet. Martyrdom is a lie. Human blood sacrifice has never and will never absolve anyone of personal responsibility for their actions in this or any world. 

These men are pawns for cowards, killing and dying for less than nothing. Violence begets violence. 
This attack shows that there is no need to go to the middle east to fight ISIS, they are right here in Europe. How about getting serious about curbing the very obvious and violent muslim colonisation of Europe? Start by eliminating their very generous social payments that are funding their huge families at the expense of native French births. Deport all non-citizen muslims, don't let any more of them into Europe. Tear down mosques that host preachers promoting violence. Revoke citizenship from anyone promoting radical groups in any way.

In the mean time, create a system for law-abiding french citizens to defend themselves. If 1% of the population had concealed carry weapons permits and martial training the terrorists in Paris would have faced dozens of people shooting back. Instead they were very relaxed knowing that their victims had no way to defend themselves.
The never ending war against Islam continues. Is there an end game? Radical muslims are everywhere in the world. I would close all the mosques in the US but that won't happen. The PC police stop the fight against radical Islam at every turn. Liberals and progressives are to blame as well.
tl;dr of everything I've read in this thread...

We're very seriously dancing around eugenics here.  Very seriously.
ITT: people who've seen Crash Course World History or played Sid Meier's Civilization.
When ISIS is destroyed I hope they use pig blood dipped bullets to carry it out.
This is the 3rd attack in France in a year? Make a coalition and put Putin at the head. 
Instead of going to war externally, countries need to be more aggressive in eradicating sources of radicalization and terrorism in their own countries too. And for God's sake this is not a time for political correctness to come in.
i remember france from 90' it was beautiful and climate country, now its a half islamic country
Whew... **[We dodged a bullet there](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YDdCkW9AqmY/UT31FYeVCDI/AAAAAAAABdc/1239kdVouUc/s1600/pipeline+accidents+final+animation1-2.gif)** 

Gotta' keep that [Canadian Oil from coming into the U.S. via pipelines](http://www.sensysmag.com/spatialsustain/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/all_pipe.jpg). 
Obama also said that the Keystone pipeline would not create as many jobs in the long run. If the senate really is interested in creating jobs - they should start looking at a new bill that would lift infrastructure
Why does he do this yet approve Arctic Shell drilling and TPP? Such an up and down President. 
So still by trucks and rail then...
Please correct me if I am wrong, but is it not better for the environment to transport via pipelines?  I assume that a large pump supplying pipeline pressure probably does not get anywhere close to the air pollution and emissions caused by transporting the liquids via on highway trucks or large tanker ships.
[deleted]
This is the biggest load of nonsense decision. Pure lip service with no actual effect on the use of fossil fuels.
Our oil trains roll over old bridges, over critical waterways, through heavily populated areas, using antiquated tanker designs.  Since the burden is increasingly being shifted to rail and existing infrastructure, let's please see a little more focus there. 
This is utter bullshit and is a political move, that's what this whole pipeline has been about - politics. The tar sands are dirty business, that is an undeniable fact. However, instead of building a pipeline that transports oil from a province that has a carbon offset tax of $15 per tonne (recently doubled to $30 per tonne)^1 , Washington has decided to deny the project approval. Even though the US imports tar sand derived oil from Venezuela^2 . A dictatorship that does not care about health, safety, the environment or public accountability. In lieu of importing energy from a democratically accountable first world nation with court enforceable environmental regulations and a carbon tax, the Administration has decided to continue importing Venezuelan oil. If the White House was legitimately concerned with GHGs they would have chosen the Canadian project. Keystone XL has always been just a game between Democrats and Republicans. Obama could've traded this in return for something else from Congress.

This is such a disingenuous fight for the environmental lobby. Their are a lot of real issues that need to be dealt with in the oil and gas industry, but safe transportation of oil is not one of them. All this is doing is causing the oil that would go through pipelines to instead be transported via. train. It's just a symbol more than an actual concern. 


This is such an odd thing to dig your heels in over. Instead they really need to focus on the horrible unregulated fracking and the damage is causing. Or work to keep oil companies accountable for their spills and strengthen the EPA. Pipelines are not the problem.


Edit: FYI https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/20/its-a-lot-riskier-to-move-oil-by-train-instead-of-pipeline/
Lmao. The comments here are hilarious. No matter whether you were pro-Keystone, anti-Keystone, environmentalist or lobbyist, yall can all agree on one thing: Obama did **something** wrong. 
The truth about the keystone pipeline is it's a huge non-issue either way. Whether it gets built or not makes very little difference economically or environmentally -- just some marginal effects on oil prices and profit and construction industry jobs. Both parties are to blame for turning this into a huge political wedge issue when there are more important things to be talking about. In the end Obama's decision is mostly symbolic, signaling that oil is not the future or something (while his administration continues to approve other oil infrastructure projects that never make the news). I don't agree that it was the right decision but I also wouldn't want to be the one making decisions in the ridiculously irrational environment that is US politics 
I wonder if he was waiting until Harper was gone before announcing that to avoid any diplomatic issues.

(edit: typo)
Christ, there are some dumb motherfuckers in these comments. Reddit is like a battle of who can have the most empty cynicism about fucking everything. 
Honestly there is an extremely minimal environmental concern for building the pipeline, they'll just move it in by truck instead. 
Do people realize that since the Keystone Pipeline has been discussed we've built the [equivalent of 10](http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/america-has-built-the-equivalent-of-10-keystone-pipelines-since-2010-and-no-one-said-anything) Keystone Pipelines?  
Win for OPEC.
Meanwhile, the equivalent of ten Keystones have already been built in the United States since 2010. So it's not really about the environment.

Politicians and Hollywood stars sure don't mind having huge carbon footprints though.
So what happens now is that the oil is transported over land, by rail.  This emits more pollution than transporting by pipeline.  Way to go, idiots.
Can't ban Keystone Light.
Jeez-Louise it took him long enough. Where's he been until now? Nevermind that a foreign corporation is allowed to use US law to do imminent domain to take property of American citizens, not for public good for Americans but for private foreign gain. Nevermind that a whole bunch of property owners found oil company personnel trespassing on their land and were told they would have to give up their property. Nevermind that it would only create a few jobs without any requirement that Americans would get those jobs and nevermind that the oil would be sold elsewhere and not to Americans. Obama doesn't give a shit about that. But at least he's no longer supporting the pipeline. 
As a Canadian I'm happy about this because the oilsands are making a massive contribution to global warming.  Because of the oilsands Canadians have the highest per capita CO2 emissions in the world.  I know economically it's going to make things even worse for us as a country, at least short-term, and even more difficult for people living in Alberta, but this is oil we should be leaving in the ground. It's dirty, it uses massive amounts of energy and water for the extraction process.

It's time as a country to turn our economy around using green energy solutions instead of bolstering an unsustainable petro economy.


LOL, TransCanada just asked to delay the ruling on the Keystone XL and after 6 years of waffling Obama rejects the project 3 days later.  I mean I'm against the extraction and burning of tar sands as much as any one that drives a gas car, but the timing is too funny.   

I have the train tracks .5 miles from my house that will carry the oil from Montana, the Dakotas, and yes, Canada.  

I think rejecting a pipeline, although the right choice, does little to change the fossil fuel industry.  MuchAdoAboutNothing.

edit ; punctuation
This has nothing to do with climate. It's a political move to play up his base.

The oil will just be rerouted on leaky tankers to China's unregulated refineries, causing more risk and environmental impact.
It's nice to finally come across a discussion where every single person is a complete fucking expert.
After reading this thread, it's no wonder politicians don't bother even *trying* to accomplish anything.  90% of this thread is people whining.
I see a lot of comments arguing that the rejection is a poor decision. That the oil will be transported anyway, and that this is a "purely political decision", as if it's self-evident that the decision itself therefore has no value. But I posit that there's much more to this than a simple transferral of oil.

Climate change action is one of those difficult issues on which most reasonable people agree we should do something, it's just very hard to agree on exactly what. Environmentalists, for better or worse, chose Keystone XL as one of their stands. Why? It's high publicity, and an approval of the pipeline is an implicit approval of the Alberta tar sands extraction. But both for environmentalists and the administration that's not nearly the most important part of the pipeline. The core of the issue is this; the environmentalists took a stand, and now it's about the signalling effect of the response.

The signalling effect is vital to politics, and yet so many people seem to completely ignore it. To put it in youthful terms, think of it as buying an expansion pack to a game you like. You might not actually play the game that much more, but by buying the expansion you're signalling to yourself, and more importantly to everyone around you, that you view the game as a part of your upcoming life. When Obama rejected Keystone it's not just about whether the oil is transported by train or pipeline, it's also a signal to America and the world that his intention is a transition away from fossil fuels.

You may think of this as a simplistic analysis, but international politics work in a similar way. Climate change should have been acted on many years ago, but game theory implies that no country will do anything on their own. (The Rubio argument; "China isn't doing anything, so why should we?") When enough others start, though, eventually it's a lot easier for a country to persuade its inhabitants that they should join in. It's kind of like smoking in restaurants: it's entirely acceptable until a certain tipping point, after which social norms force you to move outside. Although international policy agreements are vastly more complicated, they follow a similar pattern, and it's much easier for the US to broker an agreement if they're out ahead, leading.

Keystone XL, whether you like it or not, has become a symbolic issue in the American fight against climate change. Accepting a pipeline now would send a massive signal to the American people and the world that we may talk the talk, but we sure as hell won't walk the walk. Obama rejecting it, on the other hand, shows leadership and puts us in a position to get a deal in the Paris climate negotiations in December. In other words, Obama wants the US to be the first person to walk outside to smoke.

To add to that, the refusal to develop the pipeline counts doubly because of the small dividends from cancelling the project; if we're willing to sacrifice economic value for symbolic gestures, imagine what we would sacrifice for real global action.

If you're serious about climate change action, early steps like these are absolutely vital.
And the rail company, that Warren Buffet owns, used in place of the pipeline is better for the environment?
Obama: "Keystone would not have served the "national interests" of the US. Shut up and eat our TTIP instead."
So how is this preventing the changing climate?
Obama should stop bombing countries and increasing the amount of money spent in the Middle East on fuel and resources for the same climate concerns. 
Okay so let's build some refineries in Canada now, dammit. 
Yup.  Let's just keep shipping it all by rail and blowing up towns.  Let's keep getting oil from fucking Saudi Arabia and fucking around over there.

 Because all that's so much better.
Gurd durmit Urbarma! Herpy derp Wut about duh JERBS??!?!?!?! 
This doesn't change anything. The oil will still get to where it needs to go, only now it will be via trains and cargo ships. He is not saving the environment people. This is a publicity stunt so he looks good at his environmental meeting that is coming up. 
Thanks Obama. 
I'm more worried about running a large oil pipeline built by the lowest bidder, right across the big aquifer that sustains the nation's bread basket. But yeah... Climate change or something.
Glad to hear we're rejecting that dirty Canadian oil. We should only be buying from our Saudi friends, who just crucified a man, beheaded plenty more, and marry 16 year old girls on a regular basis.

Clearly, they're the better allies.
Wow. US government has game. Reject TransCanada's request pause the application a few days ago (speculation is that they wanted to re-pitch it to a possible republican government) and them reject the whole thing. Interesting.
What the hell is with all the removed comments? 
There are 10 other pipelines that where built that arw just like keystone. Keystone was a political smoke screen.

http://www.financialpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=business.financialpost.com//news/energy/america-has-built-the-equivalent-of-10-keystone-pipelines-since-2010-and-no-one-said-anything
disagrees with KEYSTONE pushes TPP in secret HMMMM
I'll be honest here. I only clicked on the comments section for the guaranteed shitstorm. Thanks for delivering, Reddit.
It's already been demonstrated that the pipeline would have no effect or a positive effect on climate change considering that the alternative methods of oil transportation require much more fossil fuel usage than a pipe. This is symbolic-stupidity environmentalism - the same exact idiocy that keeps nuclear energy from being utilized. Dumb shits more interested in form than function. 
so instead of using new technology pipelines to tie into the already massive pipeline network that currently runs that same oil around half the country and instead make it a more direct line bypassing all those extra states and older systems...

We will continue to use the old network that routes that oil through 7 different states AND continue to use diesel burning trucks and rail that have seen large increases in accidents causing leaks.

Yea, let's block this "for the environment". 

Sorry kids, but that oil is going through the US already, just by existing means that are more damaging to the climate and environment. This is nothing more than political payback for Obama's donators and buddies. It has nothing to do with climate/environment.
Since pipelines are so much more dangerous than trains...
Climate concerns?  Does he think that refusing to pipe the oil through the US will prevent it from being burned?

That is the most ridiculous reasoning I've seen in a long time.
How does putting the oil on trucks, boats and trains save the climate?
Whatever does not go by pipe will go by rail now, already the largest customer of railroads. the oil will get to market, but with an even heavier carbon footprint. It will also go to Canadian refineries, a good thing for us Canadians, we keep the jobs. Or it will go offshore via the energy east pipeline. 
As a resident of the State of Nebraska, I approve of this outcome.
lets end the war on pipe.
"I am very disappointed that one pipe, nearly a metre wide, is being asked to bear all the sins of the carbon economy." - Calgary Mayor Naheed Nenshi
Because delivery by truck and train is so much more environmentally friendly. /s
Warren Buffett is extremely giddy right now over this decision...
Are there any legal barriers from the next President saying "oh yes we will"?


Wouldn't all the jobs just go to temporary foreign workers, as per T.P.P., anyway? Untrained welders working on a huge pipeline... what could possibly go wrong?

I am sad because I posted this at the exact same time and got 4 upvotes :( but happy because Keystone is over! :)
It's unfortunate that the big enviros decided to go after Keystone XL as a "solution" to global warming. In fact, the oil is still going to be produced, still going to be burned, still going to cause an environmental impact. Opposition to Keystone XL is simply a distraction from the real issue, which is reliance on fossil fuels and the consequences of oil sands production. It's a fact that pipelines are safer for the environment than trains, and in reality the pipeline could be seen as a good compromise between environmental protection and energy production interests. If we want to stop oil sands production and address global warming, we need to focus on solutions to our energy needs. Instead, the focus is on one small facet of the problem. I'm sure many nonprofits were able to raise a lot of money for themselves on the issue, but in the end they really accomplished nothing for the climate.
I always understood that the pipeline actually already exists, and the Keystone XL project is actually shortening the distance the oil travels thereby making it more efficient and exposing less area to a potential oil spill. 

Also, they have had to use trucks to transport it without the pipeline as well.  Seems like its pretty inefficient and more hazardous to the climate. 
Shouldn't it be environmental concerns? Also shouldn't it be  because as it has already been shown that the pipe line it would connect to is already leaking oil in various places. Also that this would displace people form their homes and not actually generate many jobs.
I am no scientist, and the only world news i keep up with is WorldStar.. but i have to assume this keystone pipelines function is to transport beer from city to city. Yo, you really dropped the ball on this one Obama.
I didn't listen to the entire speech but I made it just past this point - 

&gt;"Think about it. *Since I took office, we’ve doubled the distance our cars will go on a gallon of gas by 2025*; tripled the power we generate from the wind; multiplied the power we generate from the sun 20 times over."

Do you see what he did there? Taking credit for something that's *supposed* to happen by 2025 and then continuing to talk in the past tense, confusing what's *planned* to happen with what already has.

I'm not an Obama basher, I think when all is said and done he's no better or worse than any other politician. I'm just saying, it's this kind of tactic that makes someone sound untrustworthy.
Yet they've built 10,000 miles of pipeline while going back and forth on Keystone XL. It's a political decision, not a climate one. 
ELI5 this whole keystone pipeline? 
For those of you saying the oil will get here anyway by truck or train, or that there are already hundreds of pipelines, or that this will do nothing to benefit the environment, the answer is simple:

For the political left, intentions matter much more than results. Obama is showing good intentions here, and idiot leftists eat that shit up.  
The thousands of jobs it would create in not only construction but fabrication and maintenance, less crude transported by rail, faster, better, cheaper than rail. Billions in taxes. 
Leave it to reddit to make me bummed out about a supposedly good thing. 
Stating the Obvious:

This came right after Trudeau's elect.

Can anyone ELI5 Obama's cynical political maneuvering?

did the eminent domain part not bother him at all? that small part where big government and big business get together to take the little guy's house and property, just so they can make an extra dollar?
Nice. Obama making bad blood so we can back out of TPP before they fuck us even more. 
Canadians can still bring oil by rail Americans.
For a second I thought this post was about a new type of beer. I'll just let myself out. 
Booooooooo.
Climate concerns as in, "the climate for shale gas jobs may stiffen if we provide cheaper and less polluting alternatives"
its all cause the election and the liberal majority.. hahaha so evident its not even funny.. obama all about climate concerns sure bud, we all know the companies running in the states are questionable...

I want a Cold Stone XXL Pipeline
Does anyone else believe this decision was part of a quid pro quo for not including any climate language in the tpp? Or maybe a better way to say it would be a mea culpa? 
Better late them never.. The next President has some very tough challenges ahead. Lets hope they make strong strides to fixing a rigged political system and curbing the worst of the warming. 
The oil will still be coming into the US, on trucks and trains. Accidents will still happen.
More money for Big Railroad
So now a sound method for reducing carbon emissions is by rejecting a plan to replace a significant amount of coal and oil fueled power production with a fuel that burns with considerably less carbon emissions.  TIL? 
Can somebody tell me, with TPP, will TransCanada Corp be able to sue the US Govt for loss of profits for denying this project?
A more efficient way to address this issue is to tax carbon instead of picking and choosing which pipelines to go through. It's not really fair. The entire industry should share the burden.
Thanks Obama!
 Its too bad it wont do a damned thing about CO2 emissions. The oil will now go East and West [Northern Gateway, Energy East pipelines] instead of south.
So... instead it will be shipped 1 of 2 ways:

1. Rail across a similar path. But rail has far more spills than pipelines plus goes through crowded areas instead of avoiding them plus much more often cause fires/explosions when spills occur.

2. Pipeline to the Pacific through the world's only temperate rain forest.

For the medium-term future the world will demand crude and Alberta will be a main supplier. Pipelines through less environmentally sensitive areas (like Keystone) are the best environmental option to get it to the customers.

Plus, did you notice that Canada's PM changed 2 weeks ago - the previous one would have fought much harder than the current one. This makes me thing the timing is political.
Meanwhile Burlington Northern Santa Fe, which owns almost all of the rail lines going to Canada is owned by Warren Buffet. Who would take a major hit if the pipeline was built and oil was no longer primarily carried via trains... Who by the way is a major political backer. . . Things continue to get curiouser and curiouser. 
Ignorance sucks.  Some people just want people to know they care but not do any fucking research about any of this shit.
Why was this pipeline a political issue, whereas the 10 just like it  that i've seen articles on, were not? I don't mean why didn't the media cover it, but rather why didn't the President and Congress have any say?
well，Canada's oil will  go to China and other places where less effectively use the oil and the climate change will even get worse LOL
would he accept......... keystone light?
I'm pretty sure he's only doing this because of plummeting oil prices and not out of any genuine concern for the environment. What we're hearing now is simply political posturing. I guess it's better than nothing.
But he's alright with Nestle privatizing water ... Interesting.
He had to reject it because the company building it has asked to put their bid on hold (basically because they knew it would be rejected).  Then, if a Republican became president, then they'd ask for the bid to be reinstated.  Sneaky little bastards!  By Obama flat out denying the request, it's pretty much dead (for now).  But in Government, dead doesn't really MEAN dead.
Idiot
Sneaks through TPP, says no to this.

GG and Thanks Obama, you abysmal shitbird.

Fast&amp;Furious, cash4clunkers, TPP, etc.
So much first level bullshit in this thread, and somehow nobody is commenting on the most obvious "talking point:" that Buffett wrote a $billion check to Obama and that Berkshire (via BNSF ownership) has benefited **enormously** by XL's rejection ensuring that pipeline capacity out of the Bakken remains nearly non-existent.

Question: do people think that construction jobs are permanent? Do they prefer no money be spent on construction and infrastructure? Because when those are finished, so are the jobs.

He absolutely did not "cite climate concerns."

In his speech he clearly stated it would not be the recipe for climate doom that some have claimed.
Welp, I know what my dad will be bitching about over thanksgiving
The keystone XL pipeline would also have prevented the train transportation of the exact same Canadian Oil, which is extremely hazardous for communities near railways, and the environment.  The oil is coming across the states anyway, the pipeline would have just made it safer and more cost effective.
If Obama says it or if he does it no matter what it is .......  he is wrong!!!  How many times do we have to see these dumb ass remarks.  
Obama is a gigantic hypocrite.

The US has built 10 pipelines since the Keystone XL saga began.
&gt; TransCanada president and chief executive Russ Girling issued a statement saying his company was "disappointed" with the rejection of its application.

&gt; **"Today, misplaced symbolism was chosen over merit and science — rhetoric won out over reason,"** Girling said.

I think he got that backwards.

President Obama cited climate concerns as a reason why he rejected the Keystone Pipeline and the **science is clear** that climate change is a man-made phenomenon, caused by the burning of fossil fuels. John Kerry made a great statement, saying, "The United States cannot ask other nations to make tough choices to address climate change if we are unwilling to make them ourselves". We can't go and chastise China for their pollution, if we do nothing to rein in our own.

And where's the merit in building the Pipeline? It would create a total of 35 permanent jobs, probably not affect gas prices in the least bit, and create a potential national disaster running through the middle of the country. Yeah, I'm good with paying a little more for gas, just to potentially avoid a major oil spill in the Heartland.
Besides If we were getting Canadian oil, we wouldn't have the privilege of buying from the Middle East.
Shipping via the pipeline uses less of a carbon footprint than other ways.  The President is being stupid here.  
Stupid games.  Have to wait until a reasonable person is in office, or have the ability to force it through.  
I don't know a lot about the environment or the economy or politics. All I know is that a buddy of mine was counting on the digging business for a stretch of this pipeline. Now he has to make decisions on who to keep on his crew,  what bills to pay for his business and whether he can continue to afford to send his two daughters to private school. 
[deleted]
Progressives really are shooting us all in the foot again.  We're opting for increased emissions and reduced efficiency by train and boat to avoid an infrastructure project like keystone.  It's the same old situation with nuclear all over again...  Keeping old, dirty, and dangerous tech to avoid modernization that isn't yet pixie focus group approved.  This is why we can't have other nice things like nuclear.
Of the 1,000 or so (mostly temporary construction) jobs that Keystone is purported to create, only a tiny fraction of them will actually be in the United States. The rest are all in Canada. 

Any argument from the Republicans that this will be a huge boon to job creation is cynical to the extreme. They know that it's not true, and that there are myriad better ways to create jobs in the US, but they know that lots of people will swallow the "job creation" argument, allowing them to line their campaign warchests with contributions from the oil industry. 

From a net benefits standpoint, Keystone is a shitty situation all around. Net benefits from Keystone are substantially negative, once the probability of a spill and the health and environmental externalities are factored in. 
[deleted]
As a welder I am a little disappointed. That would have been A LOT of work for men and women like me. 
We want infrastructure projects.  

Except when we don't.

Even when they don't cost taxpayers anything.
Refusing the Keystone XL Pipeline on the basis of Greenhouse Gas Emissions? 

United States oil transported by rail
 2008: 9,500 cars.
 2014: 493,000 cars.

The oil will move and the U.S. State Department agrees that emissions are higher by rail than by pipeline.

As someone who has worked in the Alberta Energy Sector for almost all of my career (albeit in I.T.) I would say that most people don't understand that Alberta's oil sands (or if you prefer "tar sands") is extracted with SAGD methods (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage) and not by surface mining. CSS is also used by another big player. 

This is cleaner and more carbon friendly than most of California's production.  Also, Alberta (and BC and Saksatchewan) have highly regulated energy sectors with strict regulations, unlike say.... Saudi Arabia, or Venezuela, and even the U.S.?

Maybe the Sierra Club and others should look in their own back yard first. 
man, im watching the press statement on TV and how the british news is proclaiming how this to be a defining stance. Obama is saying how some fossil fuels should be left in the ground and not to be dug up at the expense of the environment. 

The more I grow older and more I realise how much of a soap opera current affairs and politics really is. If Obama was so concerned about the environment he'll stop fracking as it's proven to pollute drinking water in high populated areas. The canadian oil are dug up from uninhabited land and has less of an environmental impact.

This is purely and simply "oil prices are low enough, sorry Canada, let's put this idea on hold". 
The reason this is good is because the US is not making a huge investment in a fossil fuel project.  The point of saying no to this is not to instead send it by rail, it is to hopefully discourage the burning of any of the tar sands oil.  Yes, it will still happen for a while.  But that oil is expensive in terms of production, especially when the increased environmental burden is factored in.  The world can not burn all its fossil fuels, and Canadian tar sands would be a nice one to have left in the ground. 
 The pipeline carries natural gas (cleaner than coal and oil) from Canada to the US. This would greatly reduce the United States dependence on foreign oil and allow us to reduce military spending as a result of a reduction in conflict from oil in the Middle East. I don't see how this has to do with protecting the environment. 

 
Citing climate concerns, but he sure doesn't seem concerned when he  sends money to Mexico and other countries so they can build pipelines and oil refineries. It's almost like he doesn't actually give a shit about the climate, but cares about sabotaging America.
In turn, this will (hopefully) create a bigger market for renewable energy.
As a Canadian. I'm thankful of this. We should be exporting refined petroleum, not crude bitumen.
Good. 

Regardless of comments citing 'the oil will be burnt anyway', there's also such a thing as public opinion and every act that defies these kinds of projects helps to create awareness regarding their environmental impact and to shift attention towards alternatives in whichever stage of research, development or deployment. 

Bottom line: Alberta tar sands is a filthy project that is destined for disaster with impacts greater than that of bp horizon disaster, the environmental impacts of which are currently immeasurable and unpredictable. To go ahead with the keystone pipeline would be irresponsible. 
I don't see what the big deal is with this pipeline.  It seems like it would be great for the country in terms of both job creation and lowering dependency on foreign oil.

I mean we're using oil, there's no question about that.  The question is where do we get the oil that we use?  Do we pay Saudi Arabia or do we use the oil under our own feet?
Trans Canada withdrew their request for a review on Wednesday. This is exactly like quitting, and your boss saying "no, you're fired!" as you are walking out the door.  (Not that they weren't going to get "fired" anyway.  That permit wasn't going to ever be granted.)
What about jobs that are created and maintained as a result of the economic activity this generates after it is complete? 

For instance, my company builds controls for pipeline firms on a regular basis. They are constantly upgrading and maintaining their equipment. I would love to do some pipeline work right about now. 
Yay! 

Now all that oil can be moved by Warren Buffet's trains instead.
Obama is now in the 'no fucks given' stage of his presidency where he will actually get around to some of those bold promises he made 8 years ago. Maybe he could get us out of the middle east and Afghanistan while he's at it?
If it was built how would this pipeline help American citizens? Don't we export most of our oil? So who is it really helping if iy was built? I feel like making temp construction jobs that fix roads and other things like that would be better.
ITT: People that have [no idea how many pipelines are already in the U.S.](http://gillreport.com/drd/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/CrudePetroleumProductsMap.jpg).
I'd like to point out KXL would transport almost exclusively bitumen, meaning it releases 40% more emissions than standard gas start to finish. plus transcanada has had several pipe failures
Revenge for Trudeau stopping the fight against isis
Eminent domain???? The government can not take away your land to give it to another person our company! It must be used for government project. This was not a government project! I'm glad it was rejected!
because bomb trains and the co2 belched out by those trains is so much better for the environment.

Gee, I wonder if Warren Buffet had anything to do with this vote.   Nahhhh.  
How stupid. Meanwhile 5-6 other pipelines that didn't make the headlines have already been constructed many along that same route. I'd far rather oil be transported via relatively safe pipeline than by barge/rail. Stupid decision overall. 
I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that Warren Buffet is making billions off transporting oil from Canada on his railroad. 
"Rejects" is an interesting description of what he did, since the permit request was actually recently pulled anyway.  But hey, if he wants to take credit for other people's work he wouldn't be the first.
362 days until national elections.  Get registered.  Get educated.  Make your vote count. 
Bullet train from NYC to LA would create huge construction jobs and permanent jobs. Make it energy efficient and everybody is happy
Meanwhile, Obama is forcing through TPP and outsourcing American jobs to Asia.

Creating a pipeline means that we use *less* of heavily polluting ships, trucks, and diesel trains. 

A pipeline is **BETTER** for the environment. 
The reason this pipeline was a big deal is it was going to go over the  Ogallala Aquifer also known as the High Plains Aquifer System.  Many states fresh water supply would be impacted if the pipeline were to break.
A lot of pipelines are failing because they are so old. A lot are from 50s. The pipes are basically cast iron covered in shitty asphalt wrapping. They're getting rusted through and rivers are scouring down to them because they weren't buried very deep. We need approval for new pipelines. Train and truck transport is not safe nor efficient.

I work in North dakota for a lady that knows a ton about the pipelines in the state.

The pipeline that broke on the yellowstone river by Glendive mt was a line from the 50s. I got to look at it closely. 
Gotta keep inefficiently moving Oil via Train car. Even though Rockefeller proved a many generations ago that pipelines are far more efficient. Anyone that thinks this isn't some crony move is a fool.

Result - claim to help the poor but really the poor are paying the premium. Elite still driving the SUV and flying the private jet.  

Why if private industry wants to build a pipeline, can one King have the power to stop it? Can someone explain the legal grounds?
Ummm not sure if this was posted already as there are alot of comments, but the oil is still flowing from up here in Canada on rail cars to the US. These rail lines and tanker cars are heavily invested by big money (Warren Buffet) and the restrictions are looser.

Canada's net contribution to greenhouse gases is really small. This is not saying that we shouldn't be trying to reduce them because we should be. 

This is pure politics and big money, not landowner rights, because if the US wasn't producing plenty of their own shale oil then this pipeline would already be built. 

I believe its mostly built on the US side already.

For disclosure I am a pipeliner in Canada. So don't hate me as I'm just putting food on the table for my family. Besides that if you wanted to get rid of all oil you would find your life not to be as good as most people use oil products in ways they can't even think of.

Oh well Energy East here we come.
Haha climate change concerns! What a bunch of typical bullshit
Well hope you like higher gas prices.
Should have cited Warren Buffett in his ear.  Railroad is killing it moving product.  
The correct solution here would have been a comprehensive energy package that passes the Keystone pipeline for the short-term benefits, but bundles in with it long-term research and development of alternative energy solutions such as solar, hydro, tidal, wind, algae, and so on.
That's fine... We wouldn't want to put those tanker truckers out of a job. /s

Climate concerns my ass.
I mean it this time. Thanks Obama. 
Meh.  Might as well post this again.  

http://keystonepipeline-xl.state.gov/documents/organization/221135.pdf

The Obama administration's official analysis of the Keystone XL project, estimating that the project will decrease oil spillage, decrease emissions, save lives, and save money, all at the same time.  

Just like pretty much every other pipeline ever built, surprising absolutely nobody who has any sense or knowledge, because pipes are the cheapest, safest way to transport large quantities of liquid anywhere.

A real environmentalist loves pipelines, whether water, gas, oil, or hell, raw sewage.  There was, after all, a time where we didn't transport human waste in pipes, and those were some smelly, diseased days.
Meanwhile China and India pollute worse than we ever did and don't have to do anything while we are made to feel like the villains and suffer? Fuck that. Build the fucking pipeline already and take all the credit. 
Let's just keep transporting it by train instead.  Brilliant.
yes, this is much better thant he exploding smoldering trains carrying the oil.
I'm actually happy that he did. Yes it benefited my countries GDP (Canada) but I'd rather protect the environment. 
&gt;"The point is the old rules said we couldn’t promote economic growth and protect our environment at the same time,” he said, “but this is America and we have come up with new ways and new technologies to break down the old rules.”        

Isn't this the whole point of leadership? Seeing what's new and important and making wise choices to help guide us in the best possible direction? It's sad to me that Congress has often prevented this president from directing the country towards a better future.
Its Depend upon the situation of the issue that how it is raised?
That steel will probably be re routed
Pressure from Saudi Arabia did this.  They lowered oil to put the squeeze on Putin.  This has nothing to do with the enviroment.
"...protect the one planet we’ve got while we still can.”

Positioning himself against Mars development already?  Secure spot for a lame duck, I suppose, but it sets a precedent for a conservative extra-planetary agenda among the moderates in the US. 
Yeah I remember an interview where he said he was more of a Natty Light kind of guy
Explanation for idiots (like myself):  Global economic politics won't allow for the US to take so much away from Arab countries who rely almost solely on oil exports. Also, it's against everything to piss off muslim countries nowadays.
So the secret to getting him to actually make a decision on this after all these years was asking him not to. Then he couldn't wait. 
Maybe this project will create a few "temporary" jobs in the short term but this project is really about gov subsidies from Canada.  The KSP is taking Canada's shitty oil sands and sending it to the gulf for export.  It's f'd because we have the largest  nat gas reserves in the world and there are limitations on export.
What exactly is the keystone XL project?
If our government is going to use oil then we should at least rely on oil that we refine in the states. If not, fine; give us the clean, renewable energy we need instead. 
I believe that Trudeau only was disappointed in the outcome as a political move. Let the girl break up with you instead of you having to dump her. "Oh no, I totally wanted that pipeline, too bad that the US ended it"

That way Trudeau isn't attacked for pulling the deal, but no pipeline lines up with their environmental policy.
Schill comments as far as the browser can scroll. Who woulda thunk it in a post about the oil industry?
TransCanada already put a hold on application. 

This is just red meat to the ultra liberal, delusional democrat base, which now make it a non-issue for Hillary's campaign. 

In addition, with gas prices low, nobody even cares. Give it 5 years when oil rebounds. It'll heat up again.
Super weird to see the president talking about the company I work for while I'm sitting in the lunchroom. 
Was it the climate of the oil market? Ha...
I'll admit my finger isn't typically on the pulse of the community, but when did XL sub-premium beer become an Executive concern? 
Isn't US news disallowed on this subreddit?
Refine in Canada! 
His TPP agreement will effect climate concerns as well.

Hey /u/neosporin,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
I wish I could use Obama's XL pipeline to bring me some black gold. If you know what I mean ;)
Harper literally just shit all up in his last pair of good PM pants. I wonder if he sold all his stock yet ?
While this is true, one more fact stands--the company that was pushing for the pipeline has asked it's application to be put on hold. Why? Oil prices went down so far it just doesn't make sense. This is the most politically safe opportunity to block it, since nobody has a reason to keep fighting it (for now).
&gt;crocodiles cannot be bribed unlike human guards

Except with meat
&gt; It’s not a human rights violation when a crocodile does the killing.

This is hilarious!
Isn't this pretty much how Australia started?
crocodiles who aren't hungry won't kill. Throw 5 prisoners in the water until the crocs are done eating and simply swim out of jail.
Do we have a volcano, or at least a pit of lava in the center of the prison?
Never been a fan of security systems that can be disarmed with snack food.
They cannot be bribed *like* guards, but they can be bribed *with* guards.
ironic since crocodiles often symbolize corrupt and greedy officials... 
Maybe we should elect crocodiles to Congress.
"*...crocodiles cannot be bribed unlike human guards.*"

FALSE

You can always bribe a croc by offering a fatter convict.
Amazing. The rapist, murderers, pedophiles, and corrupt politicians can stay on land...but the heroin addict who needs serious help...to the island with you.
For those not already familiar with Indonesia, its a shitshow of a country.  Every year plantation owners set fires to clear land which is highly illegal and causes [really hazardous smog](http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2015/s4344018.htm) throughout the region.  In spite of it being illegal, and regardless of condemnation from the President and Vice President of Indonesia, the fires have continued because of [widespread corruption](http://theconversation.com/why-indonesia-cant-stamp-out-fires-that-have-cast-a-haze-over-south-east-asia-50029).  

I wish this were the only example of corruption in Indonesia, but [unfortunately](http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Archdiocese-of-Jakarta-organises-seminar-to-tackle-corruption-35646.html)  the [corruption](http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/09/indonesia-pertamina-probe-idUSL3N13435T20151109) in Indonesia is a [thing](http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/sideviews/article/on-fighting-corruption-kanti-pertiwi).  

Full disclosure: I live in Singapore currently and have been choking on Indonesian haze for 3 months now and I'm a little sick of their shit.  
Lol you know bribery and corruption is a problem when...
"It’s not a human rights violation when a crocodile does the killing."

Logic checks out. 


Indonesia and 8 yo me had a lot in common idea wise.
You live by krokodil, you die by crocodile
[deleted]
Mistreating animals and humans at the same time, now that's efficiency.
I want to know what the thought proccess of this was. The real one, I mean. Come on, hungry crocodiles? There's gotta be a story behind this.
Well in Honduras there are 10,000 starving crocodiles... Funny how all things work out in the end
Indonesia clearly needs to pirate more US films, otherwise they would know about the t-bone-steak-to-the-croc trope (well, usually it's dogs but it still works)
"meat-hungry"
Lol. 
**Hey Raj, don't go ordering any of those vegetable-hungry crocs this time. They weren't effective at all!**
The prison would also be self sufficient in terms of financing. Just sell the rights to a reality show to some big network, and bam! Millions of dollars are flowing in because let's face it, you would really enjoy seeing people get eaten by crocodiles. 

You would feel a little bad if those were just any regular citizens, but still watch it. However, the fact that they are drugdealers will allow you to justify the killings and watch without any guilt.
Note to self: Do not smoke weed in Indonesia

Is it not sad to anyone else that they are thinking of such a violent security measure for drug convictions?? Wtf... its just substances that you put in your own body. 
Cuz drugs are worse than death. 
Or they could legalize the illegal drugs and the convicts wouldn't be able to bribe the guards in the first place. No black market, no black market profits,  no cartel. 
Pole Vaulting will be a new thing among drug traffickers in Indonesia.
The crazy part of this story is not the Crocodiles it is that Indonesia is such a backwards country that they put drug offenders on death row.
they could just legalize drugs
You can bribe crocodiles with smaller inmates.
[Except maybe this guy.](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/Nqencj4CaMMoGk2KMK5UAUcNruyvL2JZZ-6X1lJbk2nCm1i_krv81qq00UT1-jd1mq8Z4cFjcrqOI1Bc7u1ZVL_DajufUVbd6QBlRg3mWGPPiY4Mog=w469-h314-nc)
They should save their money and legalize, regulate, and tax drugs.  Then use the revenue to help pay for anti-drug-abuse education and addiction treatment.  It's a much more efficient, civilized, and humane way of dealing with the drug issue.

Save the 'gators for murderers and rapists.
They can be drugged and not tell anyone.
Is Indonesia just like...some kind of 90's cartoon villain's private country? Like I swear I saw this on an episode of captain planet....
They can, however, be walked on like stepping stones.
This is some Prisoner of Azkaban shit.
Looks like alligators in the picture, not crocodiles.
How do you get them to wear the uniforms?
Wait... if they are meat-hungry, can't you bribe them with meat?
TIL My 10 year old self is in charge of running Indonesian prisons
Crocodiles can be bribed with dead cat carcases. 
That's pretty metal.
Actually, they CAN be bribed, just save up all the meat you own and offer it to the crocodiles and swim FAST!

This is a strategy that crooks use on Rottweilers. 
Metal
Indonesia is know for it's cheap labor and now they are going to use crocodiles and they openly say they will not feed them. 

A hungry crocodile can be bribed with a bit of food.
ITT: Should've hired Reddit to build this prison.
I once seen a dude bribe a crocodile with a thick juicy ribeye steak. 
thats made up ... to stupid to be true
But they can be captured and eaten. Assuming their tails have the same texture as Alligator. Gator bites, gator burger, and gator gumbo are delish.
Suddenly, every escape attempt includes a whiny little shit that nobody likes.
You want dementors not crocodiles.  I have it on good authority that dementors are the worst part about prison.  
Sure they can be bribed. Just give them meat.
You see, crocs can only eat so much. Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my fellow prisoners at them until they reached their limit and shut down.
&gt; It’s not a human rights violation when a crocodile does the killing.

Gotta love that logic
Prison Break season 5..?
I wonder how big the bribe was to get the drug lords there own island fortress. :p
With Fricking Lazer Beams!!!

Escape Plan
Step 1. Feed Crocodiles fellow inmates.
Step 2. Swim to freedom.
This when the rest of the world seems to be coming to it's senses that drug prohibition is a failure.
Sacrifices will be made.

I can see this going horribly wrong....3 convicts want to escape, so one of them decides to use the other 2 as meat-bait-distraction to the crocs.

Plus, the crocodiles are smarter than Indonesia's prison planning industry.
Better to use drugs than live in Indonesia.
I have an idea for The Raid 3.
Can't you just tickle crocodiles to sleep?
Crocodiles can be bribed. If they're well-fed, they'll leave you alone. 
Could you just poison the water and then hop across the dead crocs like James Pond?!
Indonesia is a shit hole that murders people for marijuana crime. 
Why is Indonesia so hardcore about drug offenses? 
As if the drug war wasn't already comically evil enough. This is some James Bond villain level stuff. 
Meat hungry crocodiles CAN be bribed...with meat
They still need a safe way to get new prisoners into jail. That safe way must be handled by humans. Probably possible to bribe them. Still, better to have a few people which can be bribed as it will be then than to have a lot of bribeable people.
Great idea. Let's get all those dirty weed smokers in there pronto. 
This is a terrible idea.
This sounds extremely archaic. 
I bet the guy who came up with this idea made every James Bond villain's lair.
That's just cold blooded.
Push a bunch of other prisoners in first for bait, I say.  While they're busy getting chomped, GTF outta there.
ETA: or make a run for it with everyone at once...not every zebra gets eaten on "Nature".
And this didn't get posted to /r/nottheonion 

Seems pretty oniony to me
I want to believe that the person spearheading this initiative is re-reading the Harry Potter books and just trying to see how close he can make this place to Azkaban.
that's madness..youre gonna get the crocs high after eating that tainted meat...then we gotta get hippos to keep the crocs in line.
I can bribe the crocodile with my weak cellmates' meat
Just legalize all drugs, ffs.
All drugs should be legal. It is none of the government's business what I put in my body. Contrary to popular belief not everyone who does hard drugs goes out and steals/robs/rapes/kills.  Also contrary to popular belief lives are seldom ruined by hard drugs.  Most people who do heroin/crack/meth had ruined lives before they started getting high. But then looking into those ruined lives would mean facing up to the brutality, unfairness and injustice of our societies.  Much easier to blame drugs than to face up to the forces in society that destroy so many lives. It's no coincidence that the upsurge in narcotics use in many communities is tied to economic depression.  But consumers, CEOs and stockholders don't give a damn about human damage as long as they can maximize profits and get their precious consumer items for a cheaper price.
That would have made an excellent movie for Steve Irwin to break Hollywood. Somehow Terri ends up trapped in Indonesian gaol because some bad person planted marijuana in her boogie board bag. And Steve has to use all his crocodile skills to break in and rescue her.

They could have it turn out that the crocodiles are being mistreated, and Steve can educate the Indonesians about animal welfare, and everyone learns a lesson and high fives all round, laughing and freeze frame.

Or you know, an awesome iPhone game.
James Bond would just step on them..... Follow me, boys!

Impel down here we come
Unless you bribe them with meat.
I feel like crocodiles are not nearly aggressive enough for this to work. Unless you are spending a considerable amount of time within their sights or get extremely close, or build pretty extreme walls to scare people enough knowing they will get eaten if they can't scale it.
Should make like a double wall, if you try and escape but can't, no way to get back out.
Then I realized this is for (mostly) non-violent drug convicts. Maybe they should just surround the prison with rehab facility entrances, that would work a whole lot better.
and sharks with lasers
During WWII meat hungry crocodiles ate hundreds of escaping Japanese soldiers.  Ramree Island (Yangbye Kywan) lies off the Burma coast and in 1942 the rapidly advancing Imperial Japanese Army captured the island along with the rest of Southern Burma. In January 1945 the Allies launched an attack to retake Ramree and its neighbour Cheduba, with the intention of establishing sea-supplied airbases on the islands.

Naturalist Bruce Stanley Wright's description of the huge salt water crocs occurs in his 1962 book Wildlife Sketches Near and Far:

"That night [of the 19 February 1945] was the most horrible that any member of the M.L. [motor launch] crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left. . . . Of about one thousand Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were found alive."[4]
crocodiles can also be eaten. unlike guards. unless you're really hungry...
Throw one innocent man in there. Add a gang of inmates wanting to help him escape, and I think you got yourself a great movie. 
Or maybe treat drug abusers as patients instead of criminals and legalize marijuana.  We also need to take a good hard look at pain killers and decide if getting people hooked is worth the relief it gives them.  I get 20-30 calls some nights from patients in their rooms asking for pain killers, anti nausea medication, and anti anxiety medication.  This can sometimes be minutes after they receive their scheduled dose.
Step 1. bribe them with meat.

Step 2. escape. 
At least now it's easier to get rid of prison snitches. 
Fuck guys, let's replace all of the politicians with blood thirsty predators. They can't take bribes and so corruption will come to and end, right?
Better give them surface to air missile too... because they're hardly likely to be able to respond to a helicopter escape, and they're becoming pretty damn common.
Don't give Trump any ideas; he'll stock the Rio Grande.

By the way, what will the crocs eat when no prisoners go swimming?
They also won't try to fuck the inmates.
I'd eat the crocodiles. 
I'm pretty sure the drug convicts ain't the ones high in this situation 
Superjail did it first!
What happens when Indonesia floods due to illegal deforestation?
or can they?
This is like a real life prison of azkaban
This sounds like a not the onion article
[Roger Moore would like a word..](
https://youtu.be/kmH0PP_zAKo?t=3m54s)
This sounds like the premise to a thought experiment
So pretty much, " prisoners develop rudimentary weapons and fight killer crocks."  This I would like to see on TV.  Then we need to find a way to split the convicts into different factions.  After pitting them against one another we can do some side interviews and really get there take on the island and their peers.  

Can't be bribed. 

Use meat-hungry crocodiles.

I see a problem with their plan.........
WHAT YEAR IS IT?
Because helicopters definitely aren't a thing...
Indonesia can do much better. Why not simply outsource their prisons to North Korea? I am sure the North Koreans can do it on the cheap and they are experts in keeping people from escaping their prisons. And as bonus I am sure the recidivism rates will plummet. 
Is this for real? I'm Indonesian, and think that this is a very shitty idea. I thought it was a joke. 
So...Australia?

&gt;It’s not a human rights violation when a crocodile does the killing.

Hmm.. I'm going to have to think about that one a little more.
&gt;You can't bribe crocodiles. You can't convince them to let inmates escape.So when they try to escape they will be eaten. It’s not a human rights violation when a crocodile does the killing.
Looks like Nathan Fielder is doing consulting work in Indonesia now
When I landed in Jakarta, the first English sign I saw at the airport read "Death to drug dealers."  So, you know, this makes sense.
Sounds like Azkaban 
Yea but crocodiles can be scared, or just choose not to bother, or tricked, or even over powered (Steve Irwin-style). It's a little bit harder to that with a guard armed with a machine gun.
Isn't Angola prison in Louisiana essentially this? 
TIL (Today Indonesia Learned) crocodiles can be wrestled.
Poison some meat and you're free.
So we're remaking Australia?
Batman: Arkham Island
Leaving aside all the other stupidity and how you could bribe them with meat... Crocs aren't even that aggressive (outside of breeding season) if a 70yr old who just had his second hip replacement isn't afraid to get within 8-10ft of one on the golf course to avoid a penalty stroke, they probably aren't good guards.  
People always find a way...
Wasn't there just a massive crocodile farm that was being held by police somewhere in the world? Are these those crocs?
I didn't realize the Indonesian government was populated entirely with supervillians. 
I'll watch the movie of that story for sure.
I smell a political "get tough" ploy.
I pictured the planning group to be [like](https://media.giphy.com/media/APcFiiTrG0x2/giphy.gif)
Reptiles have some the worst food comas. Drop in a few ton of meat then you can just swim pass them. They can also be easily drugged or poisoned. This is just wishful thinking on the prisoner architect's part.
Trump will love this: "Drug addiction is *easy* to solve. Indonesia has a solution to it, and Florida is infested with alligators..."
Why not sharks with lasers? 
Remember: Indonesia's perception of justice is only slightly more humane than Saudi Arabia's so most of those prisoners will not be some evil drug lords but people getting caught with a few grams of weed in their bags. 
Drug prohibition causes a lot more problem than it solves or drug legalization.
This is how it's done https://youtu.be/OhUlXS09lM0
If I was a prisoner I would bribe an on-building guard to throw many prisoners to satisfy their hunger and create a distraction, while I will float away on a plank. 
Just build a fucking raft. I'd be out of there within the week. 
No way this could go badly...
They have only suggested his because Steve Irwin is dead!  /joke
I dunno. I just saw a video of a kitty cat scaring a croc (or alligator) into retreat.

Prisoners would just need to work on their hissing and aggressive hand swiping.
are they flying crocs, because the kingpins would just get a helicopter to come for them.
You kids and your heroin addicted crocodiles.
I don't think life OUT of bars in Indonesia is enough reason to get through some crocs.  
Surround people with crocodiles  because they chemically altered their minds or because they sell chemicals to people that want to chemically alter their minds.

Murderers, thieves and rapists get the nice prision. What a backwards world.
Easier to sneak past a crocodile than a guard though.
Woah that's rough.
Can we please get some crocodiles with frickin lasers attached to their heads?
Ahhh, but you can bribe the guards to replace the meat-eating crocodiles with plant-eating ones...
How long until prisons there are guarded by sharks with lasers attached to their backs?
You know what u  can do to counter a croc? Boats and airplanes
they realize crocs have other weaknesses right?
Well, if it works...
Sounds like the war on drugs is doing a great job in Indonesia. 2% of the population addicted to drugs? Surely once they've killed all of them the problem will be gone. /s
Bring in a few chickens with you, throw them in the water, swim to freedom. Much cheaper than a cash bribe.
Why not just use Komodo Dragons?
plot twist: the US will lease it for thier overflowing prisons. 
Time to go croc-hopping!
Iunno', seems like a load of *croc* to me.
The only prison that can hold Sterling Archer.
Yeah but if they have a steady diet of other prisoners than you can swim pass them while they are digesting their previous meal. 
Hmmmm...well that's efficient.
Looks like we've got our plot for The Raid 3.
LOL at everyone just saying "throw them some meat"...if you've every been around a bit of hungry crocs or alligators you'd know that probably isn't a good call.

If it's moving quickly in the vicinity of their mouth...it gun' dead

It's not like 100 crocodiles are going to be like,"well, they already threw us a couple cows let's let them wade past us"
[ლ(´ڡ`ლ)](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/disney/images/e/e4/Robinhood-disneyscreencaps_com-4843.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120427191211)
TIL crocodiles can't be bribed.
"...and if you manage to make it through the croc pit, then you have to survive the haunted forest."
or let the drug offenders out and stop wasting cash on nonviolent people
Drug convicts as in addicts, or as in smugglers dealers and suppliers? 
Well...they do have a point...

But this is going to end up creating another Australia.
"Cannot be bribed" 

So guys, who do we not like? Throw Hakim and Futik at them. One they take the bribe make a run for it. 
that's a damn stupid thing to do, them he will hack fellow inmates and bribe those fucking hungry reptiles and get away.
Are these prisoners on a one way trip?
Unless you count throwing fellow inmates at them and walking past a bribe....

I mean, really? 
So with no actual guards, just have your buddy show up in a boat and sail to freedom. 
DAE think this is a *bad* idea...?  

Why is indonesia so damn backwards when it comes to drug offenses? 
Also stab the Fuckers too you know. 
I never understood they're problem with drugs to the point of giving death sentences.
the prisoners will just throw other prisoners in for the crocodiles and escape 
Why not freaking sharks with freaking lasers on their heads?
Great plan, but what happens if the inmates gain the upper hand? I'll tell you what happens: 

CROCODILE-PROTECTED DRUG CARTEL HEADQUARTERS
Were the out of Sharks with frikkin' lasers on their heads?
Yet...
That's metal as fuck, but still pretty messed up.
this is such a strange/cool/great idea....but why waste this on drug addicts? Let's throw the banksters in there!
Dumbest. Idea. Ever.
I'm reminded of the *The Culture* books by Iain M. Banks, which are set in a best-case-scenario-automation-endgame utopia.  The machines do virtually all of the work, and humans are freed up to live lives of leisure.  Money isn't a thing anymore because everyone can be provided with a high material standard of living with minimal effort.

How we get there from here is, of course, the tricky part.
From Stephen Hawkings AMA 


&gt; If machines produce everything we need, the outcome will depend on how things are distributed. Everyone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine-owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution. So far, the trend seems to be toward the second option, with technology driving ever-increasing inequality.

This actually does frighten me. If we could learn to share the wealth created by such advanced robotics, we'd be fine. But if history is any indication, advanced robotics will just widen the gap between the rich and the poor.
To be followed by the era of mass depopulation.
And the choice is whether everyone gets a slice of the pie or we get Elysium.


Protect the sanctity of marriage and our jobs! No AI and robotic marriages! 
This always misses the logical progression so I'll try to add it. 

1- companies slowly replace humans with robots... Make more money. 

2- unemployment rises... People make less money. 

3- people spend less money (don't have any) so companies start making less money

4- robots stop getting purchased as companies go out of business. 

5- cheap second hand robots for sale from bankrupt companies

7- people get cheap robots and have sex with them. 

8- money irrelevant now that robot sex is plentiful. 

9- golden age ensues. 
Perhaps in the future, humans wouldn't have to "work" for a living. Robots could work all day while we explore the universe / play. 
I wrote a college paper back in 2006 that suggested the greatest threat to capitalism was automation... because eventually it would remove so many workers that the only people left to buy shit would be the super rich who eliminated the human workforce.

My professor called it wildly unrealistic.
I'm fine with AI's taking my jobs so long as I can have my own HK-47.
Great video on this from CGPGrey "Humans Need Not Apply":

I don't get why people are still clinging to the idea of us needing to work so much. We could have been down to 2 hour workdays by now, but instead we just keep creating busywork for everybody because we can't accept the notion that the work is all pretty much finished now. This species can rest on its laurels. We won the game of survival. Why not enjoy it?


But articles like this still frame the issue in the context of, "Oh no, what will we do when the robots take our jobs?!" WHATEVER WE FUCKING WANT! THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT!


Why do we insist that we need to carry on employing everybody for 40 hours a week? As far as I can tell, this is simply an arbitrary idea we arrived at sometime late in the industrial revolution, as we tried to seek a balance between servitude to factory life and unionization. And it was probably quite reasonable at the time. But now it's an outdated model, and we keep living by it only out of habit.


Sorry for the rant, this is just my pet issue lately. I sincerely believe we need to be working to automate more of our lives and start designing systems of government/economy that take into account the fact that robots do all the work for us now.


Can someone ELI5?.. If we build robots to replace our paying jobs how would that benefit industry that is based solely on selling people things that they buy with money they earned from working those jobs that robots replaced. At some point the industries that are using the robots wouldn't need the robots anymore because no one is buying the things that they make due to not being able to afford it.
And we'll either transition out of capitalism or into barbarism.
Woohoo! Seven-day weekend!
There are 2 paths ahead of us, both rooted in a post-scarcity environment. Option A.) sees people free to explore their potential in ways not handcuffed to the struggle to survive and secure their basic existence. Option B.) doesn't want to see people explore their potential and thus implements the most optimized scarcity based system, one where the provider of goods has near zero overhead and can realize close to 100% pure profit!

It is fantastic to see this in /r/worldnews because it's been at the forefront of discussion amongst those that follow AI and the progression of robotics, and that pool is too small. 

"Working for a living" is going the way of the dinosaur, and it's fantastic but things have to change. It's really important to make sure people are aware of it because we absolutely do not want to stop this movement, we need to embrace it. The only way to really embrace this change is to fully understand the implications.

First to go are transport and manufacturing jobs, which make up around [16 million jobs](http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_201.htm). Construction (at &gt; 5M jobs) will be soon to follow. Many, many more processes will be automated or ran by software instead of people. Sure, a few new jobs will pop up but not at a rate that can sustain the ones being replaced. 

We have **no choice** but to put capitalism behind us. It served us very well and has allowed us to get to where we are but it's time to begin transitioning away from it. Personally, I'd like to see a transition to sustainable living. As in you get x lbs of wood "credit" per month...after so many months you can say "I want a [new table](http://woodlandcreekfurniture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Timber-Frame-Barn-Wood-Beam-Dining-Table.jpg)" and then you put in the order if you have enough wood credit. Something to that effect. 

This is going to be reality in our lifetimes (massive loss of jobs). It's not like past claims...there are autonomous jobs popping up all over. Capitalism, by default, drives the elimination of jobs because eliminating jobs puts more money in the coffers of the elite few leading the company. I'm a young guy but I'm 100% certain my children or grandchildren will be in the middle of the inevitable storm.
we are already seeing it in supermarkets. most of them around where i live have those self-checkout things, with only one worker on a checkout
Sounds eerily like what Ted Kaczinsky wrote in his "Unabomber Manifesto" 20 years ago. 
As Kurt Vonnegut predicted in his 1952 novel *[Player Piano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_Piano_\(novel\)).*
I watched a talk by this AI guy at google recently and he said this exact thing. He also said that his group would be capable of making a kill-bot within a year if they wanted to so that anybody could just buy a robot and tell it to kill whomever he or she wants to kill.
I hope I am dead before any of this happens or at least retired with a good chunk of change in the bank.
If you think this is positive You're not familiar with humans or capitalism. 
but that could be a good thing, a great thing for humanity. People could be free to explore art and intellectual pursuits. No more toiling 9 hours a day just to pay rent and put food on the table.
People are already having a Job crisis all over the World. I wonder how doomed, the future will be 
What happens when not everyone has to be employed? Wouldnt our infrastructure need to drastically change? I remember the movie zeitgeist mentions something like this but that would need everyone in society to completely change 
It's not coming in the next 10 years, but it very well could happen in our lifetimes. Technology is a job-killer in making fewer workers more productive than many workers. 

People don't realize one of the biggest things holding back our economic recover is that companies are as efficient or more efficient with fewer workers. So while businesses are getting healthy again, there are fewer of us getting to work in it. 
Basic Income, because I know someone will mention it.   I wanna know if almost 50% of the population is not working, where exactly is the tax revenue going to come from for the government to be able to give everyone a basic income?  Thin air?  
This is why basic income and/or socialism is inevitable unless you want some sort of apocalypse outside of the walled gardens of the rich.
the era of mass employment has already ended
I wish there were some middle ground in this conversation, all I ever see is "It will be fine don't even pay attention to it, last technological revolution was good, therefor the next can only be exactly the same."

or "we're all completely screwed"

Is no one willing to actually think complexly about the fact that this could represent great challenges but great benefit, and how we're going to face these challenges, and potentially adapt to an entirely new society and economy?
And who's going to buy all the shit these robots are making? Nothing is more myopic than a corporate board of directors.
They tk yer jobs....
Network Installation: Join the winning side of the robot apocalypse!
Until AI and robotics can fulfill all of maslow's hierarchy of needs https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs

I'm not going to be worried about mass unemployment
I didn't read through everything here and its very likely nobody is going to notice this but I feel that people are being too idealistic about this. 

What I want to know is how would automation allow the overcome of the basic economic principle of unlimited demand for limited resources? Full to nearly full automation of most of the work force would occur before we could figure out how to end scarcity.

Also, everyone seems to forget that society has always functioned with a small elite living on the backs of masses of poor workers. People have lived this way for all of history, it might not seem that way now, but this power structure has just globalized with rich elites (wealthy consumer nations) living off poor manufacturing and resource producing nations (China etc.). There has been almost little to no bloody revolutions because of this, in fact most of the ones that occurred were nations still in am agrigarian state (Russia, China). 

I don't pretend to have the answers but I don't think this change would be simple, the competition for resources would likley result into a sort of 1984 scheme of elites forcibly keeping the poor ignorant and erraticaticing any revolutionaries. 

Just my 2 cents.
The only jobs I see surviving this other than artists, athletes, and politicians, are programmers. If everything's getting automated, someone's going to have to do the automating. That being said, we need a lot less people to automate something, than to do it. The way I see it, we'll have a middle class, but it'll be tiny.
"We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living." - R. Buckminster Fuller
And so who would be buying all of these products made by so many robots in factories all over the world if the products being made are not being purchased because the people who used to purchase them can no longer do so because they're unemployed? It's very much similar to what is happening now, with the jobs being moved from the US to lower-paying countries. Company "A" sells 1000 riding mowers a year, primarily to its US customers. Company "A" moves it's high-paying jobs from the US to Mexico but so does Company "B", "C", "D", and on and on, to Mexico, to China, to wherever. So their primary market, US consumers, is no longer able to purchase their products because the jobs they held, the jobs that enabled them to purchase their products, pretty much all left to find cheaper labor, to increase their profits. Ultimately what they've done is destroy the demand for their products and they, most, not all, go out of business. 
And Marx will have his due. Or he should. The hyper technological society will no longer have the need to employ the heat masses, and they must live a meaningful existence. We are provided with a number of possibilities, not all mutually exclusive:

 1. A world of radically increasing disparity between the wealthy and those who have nothing
 2. A world in which the masses are idle and do nothing productive, selling their "attention"
 3. A world in which these people are provided for to keep them mostly happy but not really having much means at all
 4. A system which equitably shares the spoils of a postindustrial society.

This is dumb. The industrial revolution didnt end the workplace. Steam engines didnt end the transport industry. And wtf is wrong with having a new technological breakthrough lets us work less hours a day and less days a week so we can spend more time actually living?
until the robots unionize and outsource the jobs to humans
Followed by massive revolution.
Who is going to buy all these products robots build?
Well jokes on you, I'm already unemployed!
If mass-employment ceases, who is going to generate the money to pay for the goods/services that the robots will make in vastly superior quantities?

The economy is not one guy owning all the money. Money is supposed to serve the economy of people having needs that are met by goods and services they buy in the marketplace.

However adamant the super wealthy are that they don't want anyone else to have anything, somebody somewhere is going to need the money to buy the goods or there's going to be very little point in anyone making any more goods that nobody can afford to buy.

Even the customer plays a role in the economy.

Here is what will happen: when too many people can no longer participate in the economy, they will make their own economic system that serves their needs. And it will happen fast and they won't care whether it's legal or not.

The economy serves the people who need it. If your needs are no longer met you'll find a different system.
Soooo, how do the companies using robots intend to stay in business when no one has a job or money?
No mass employment means we need a sort of collectivist way of distributing resources fairly. That has never worked in history. I just hope that said AI also is in charge of the distribution... 
It's really stupid when people say it'll be like the printing press and create jobs that it replaces. No this isn't like the printing press. Tell me, what jobs will be created from robots doing our jobs?  Nobody can give that answer. Maybe maintaining the robot. Which means if you're not a mechanic, then fuck you. 
Who will buy the goods manufactured by robots? 
Down with the McCormick Reaper and the Cotton Gin!  Don't they know that 98% of the jobs in our society are subsistence farming?  What mischief will people get into if they aren't picking cotton all day?


I feel like people always look to the bad side about this, to me I see some good things about this, instead of using humans we could send robots to colonize other planets, and build ships faster to go there, we could have robots to produce our food, sure there would be a huge gap between poor people and rich people but humans could do other jobs and maybe we'll distribute the wealth evenly, or we might keep the robots for only high risk jobs, maybe we could reserve the robots for uses like expansion to space and have humans keep the regular jobs (for example labourers, iron workers, teachers, police officers, ETC). I dunno this is just my opinion, if anyone feels to correct me in a civil way be free to. (Also I like the idea of sending robots to colonize other worlds and its little building robots using each other like ladders to build a house) also it seems like the companies would go out of buisness if there is no poor people buying their stuff, and if the poor people have no money then their is just people with a no longer useful currency.
What the fuck? There's mass employment? Where? I'm five months out of college and am struggling to find a job. 
Gah the comments in here are so disappointing. 


NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN. We already live in an advanced robotic society compared to 100 years ago and people still have jobs. 
With the massive economic downturn that would result from such high unemployment, what sort of market will there be for the stuff the robots make?

Does anybody else think, "I want to be around to see how this story all plays out"? I'll be dead and gone, but just like going to bed in the middle of a movie I feel like I'm going to miss the ending.
That's not gonna happen because we still have /r/shittyrobots 
The current shortage and eventual depletion of helium will end any further investigation into, or application of, quantum computing. Any prospects of AI development will be hindered in the coming decades by helium depletion.

...And force the use of medical equipment like MRIs to be rationed.

I don't think full automation of the labor market is something to be worried about.
My dog could replace some of the idiots I come in contact with throughout the average day.
I just skimmed that report they linked to -

a) its not 300 pages, its 27 pages ( hence why I was able to skim it)

b) I couldnt find the figures the Grauniad quotes (  "35% of all workers in the UK and 47% of those in the US, including white-collar jobs, seeing their livelihoods taken away by machines")  in the report.

Edit to add: The only thing I can find in the Merrill Lynch report is "Oxford University recently forecast that 45% of all US jobs will be replaced by robots within the next 20 years."
However it doesnt provide any reference for this.

The idea that 45% of US jobs will be replaced by robots within 20 years is laughable.
[deleted]
God I hope this doesn't happen. How would the economy work? It just wouldn't. I can't imagine any way this could be good for the world in this economy
Yes, this is called the technological singularity or just The Singularity.  See [here](http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Global/Singularity/sing.html) for a lovely essay by SF author Vernor Vinge . . . from 1993.

The idea is that in the (near?) future, a technology will develop that will change civilization in such a fundamental way that there's no way to predict the outcomes.  Lots of authors have tried to guess what it would be.  AI?  FTL transportation?  Nanofabrication?  Pogs?

How can it replace jobs AND end unemployment? Aren't those contradictory? 
How do we make a society like this work?
I wonder what's the point of equilibrium. Full mechanization requires great capital investment, which only makes sense if you can see profits. However, general mechanization would mean lots of unemployment which in turn would cause recession, i.e. no consumtion and no investment returns. So there should be an equilibrium rate of mechanization or a cycle of mechanization/recession/new industries that cause employment/more mechanization. 

The idea that companies would replace all employees with machines is preposterous both technologically and economically. A capital investment of such magnitude would be too risky, even more considering the consequences.
Do you want Geth? Because that's how you get Geth.
If you are worried about robots taking your job, go build a robot.
This actually does frighten me. If we could learn to share the wealth created by such advanced robotics, we'd be fine. But if history is any indication, advanced robotics will just widen the gap between the rich and the poor.

This will inevitably be the case as time progresses. The question that should be asked is to what extend can the versatility of a single AI unit go.
This is stupid. Yes AI and Robotics could replace many "current" jobs. But new jobs will be developed. The economy will go in a different direction, businesses and workers will seek new ways to make money. 
I believe its called "the internet of things".  It when 2 computers interact without human intervention.
the people who choose birth control, and already are heavily service economy oriented will prosper (like much of the west already is)

its the dumb societies that rely only on brute force, and breed like rabbits, who will suffer - but even they will be forced to adapt (or die)

jobs/working isnt the end-all - the human race used to work 24/7 on farms, and we werent more productive, we were LESS productive back then

working SMART is better, and having leisure time to develop the INTELLECTUAL leads to greater things
Too bad it would never happen, people are too selfish and unless everyone stopped working at the same time people would throw a tantrum over some people not working and others still working.
I bet robot maintenance jobs will be in big demand 
I can see Jesse Ventura using this as a point on his Conspiracy Theories on the NWO wiping out the population.
and people wonder why i'm unemployed.  i'm just ahead of the curve.
The era of mass employment came to an end with "Free trade" and NAFTA. 
How is this news to anyone? We don't even need AI, really; robotics alone are going to take over most jobs. They already handle a sizable portion of the industrial job market in first world countries, being responsible for most mass production. In the next generation or two they'll probably be sophisticated enough to handle construction work as well.

Combine this with the fact that people are more gradually turning to the internet to supply themselves with goods; games, clothes, movies, jewelry, even grocery shopping, almost anything can be gotten online and people are taking advantage of that in leaps and bounds with each passing day.

So this leaves us with a dearth of industrial jobs, and a shrinking service/retail sector. The only jobs really not under threat are those that require too much sophistication and/or human empathy, I.E. doctor, psychologist, etc. or those that could be considered artistic, like musicians, chefs, writers etc.

Now combine all this with the fact that, while population growth is generally slowing down, it's still growing. In those same two or three generations we'll probably be adding another one or two billion people to the species.

This is a serious problem. We need to find some way to structure our economy in a post-need society, which much of the first and even some of the third world might soon find themselves to be.
We need to make laws against a certain % of robots for any given corporation replacing A certain % of humans. It goes against human interest to the point of being evil, and for what? A small handful of people having more millions, that exists as 1's and 0's doing nothing for no one? 
BUT HOW WILL I JUST "WORK HARD" AND BECOME PART OF THE 1% THEN?
Then again, it could make certain projects easier, for instance ones that require a team of workers in dangerous, isolated, or harsh conditions.

I can imagine one of these rich innovative investors one day going off and starting his own country/seastead with smart robots maintaining and sustaining it. Then it's abandoned for years and someone comes along and discovers the robots still at work...hmmm.... sounds like it could make for a good story.

To quote Will Smith,"so you got robots building robots, that's just stupid".- I Robot
now's the time to introduce guaranteed income 
'The bots will end up becoming cheap enough for everyone to have one'
I was going to suggest it could be like cars in that the wealthy will have the latest, more sophisticated models, while the masses have to make do with mid-range or second-hand models.

But cars are essentially single purpose machines - a Mercedes isn't that much different in purpose than a ten year old toyota. Presumably AI/robots will be multi-purpose. So perhaps one way the wealthy will manifest their 'superiority' is that they will have the more adaptable/useful/sophisticated bots serving them - and more of them - while Joe Schmo might have a model capable of doing the dishes but not much more.
If I didn't have to clean, do the dishes, do the laundry, or cook I would not mind.
Good lord this topic brings out the stupid in people.
Yea no shit
There is no way in hell the corporations will share the profits from this most likely mass unemployment with robotic security keeping the poor in check 
This probably won't happen in our lifetimes, but I welcome it anyway. Why? It has the potential to put the power of the factory into the hands of the commoner, especially since it would be in someone's vested interest to put robotics in the hands of as many people as possible.

I would anticipate an economy where everyone can become a factory owner, although jobs in programming, entertainment, and other creative areas won't ever be replaced either. Even so, an inexpensive robot or two that can learn new things could give people a chance to bounce back even after a job loss.

This always misses the logical progression so I'll try to add it. 

1- companies slowly replace humans with robots... Make more money. 

2- unemployment rises... People make less money. 

3- people spend less money (don't have any) so companies start making less money

4- robots stop getting purchased as companies go out of business. 

5- cheap second hand robots for sale from bankrupt companies

7- people get cheap robots and have sex with them. 

8- money irrelevant now that robot sex is plentiful. 

9- golden age ensues. 
Once upon a time, 95% of the population worked in agriculture. Now 5% of the population works in agriculture. Therefore, 90% of the population is unemployed! My son works in a job that did not exist when I was his age. Don't panic just yet.
Not *IF* we decide to buy products and services made by humans. "Made in USA" "Made By Man" 

The crazy lady near my work that is always yelling at everyone and no one at the same time, the other day was yelling about how none of us need to work in this country we should all be retired. Maybe she is not so crazy.
Many people are alluding to it, but I haven't seen it mentioned:

/r/BasicIncome 
Basic income is basically a lock at this stage. Otherwise you're going to see outright revolution.
This sounds much more expensive than manipulating the migratory patterns of slave-wage labor.  We already have robots named "Miguel" and "Patel" who require far less upkeep.
When I see a printer that can fix its own paper jams, I'll take this seriously. 
First the gays, now the robots.  Marriage equality is a slipperly slope.
Who's going to pay for the development, manufacture, purchase, overseeing, and maintenance of all the robots? 
I was thinking about this. My son at 10 years old read the martian with me, gobbles up sci fi and astronomy books and truly wants to be an astronaut. 

By the time he's old enough humans won't go to space, it'll exclusively be robots. If at some point humans do go, it'll only be as tourists, not explorers.

A planet of hobbyists is a pretty shitty place. Work is good for the soul.
Nobody else here worried that the elites will simply wipe us out with biological weaponry once the robots advance enough to replace the roles ze working class and the poor are fulfilling now?

Think about it, humans do not really need a population above 10 000 to function perfectly, there are 7 billion of us now, why should there be 7 billion people if none of them are working?
Yeah, but here’s the thing: our AIs are fucking retards. Have you seen them attempt to work a mere door handle? It ain’t pretty. Humans will always have the ability to think on the fly, that’s where it matters.
So what would you do each day for 90 odd years?  There's only so much traveling you could do, only so much learning.  How would people fund doing things? Who would do the teaching?  Would we even need education if machines could retain and pass know on?

I think people would start to get bored easily if they had no roles in society and any kind of structure.
this could easily be a real issue for our society.

hundreds of millions out of work as businesses rely on robots rather than people. 

So basically we're fucked?
So to survive this, what I am seeing is to buy enough arable land for your extended family to live off of plus enough room for a production building to build these robots. Then use the rest of your resources to start getting seeds and robots to farm for you. After that use any income you do get to increase your stock of robots and raw materials and have the robots build what you need. Plans for things are readily available on the Internet. Be shrewd with your resources and waste nothing for luxuries. Then use any income that you are now generating from the robot plantation to buy more land to further increase your income.

Basically this is the American Plantation Era South all over again. The new feudalism except the workforce isn't human, can't rebel and nobody will care for their rights. And the "new" class norm will be the gentry vs the poor crackers all over again.
Didn't they say this about factories during the Industrial Revolution?
I just saw a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiwfTxVgI24) about it today. What everyone here is missing is the change in our culture and economic structure. When talking about animation, people just assume everyone will lose their jobs and everything else will remain the same.
Glad I chose a profession in computer science.
Sounds like a choice between robot overlords and multinational robber barons to me....
This will not happen for a very long time... maybe minimum wage positions like "cashier" and "warehouse assistant" will be 100% replaced in the next 25-50 years, but with it will come more technical and advanced positions to care for and develop the robots doing the work.

Robots will not replace positions more complex than that for a very long time, especially for smaller startup businesses. Just scare tactics honestly. It will make education much more valuable though.
I will be the ass and say it, 
But 3/4 of us gotta go anyways haha, 
I for one, welcome our new robot overlords. 
So what to do with all the surplus humans?
What will people do when they don't have work!! Surely they will just sitting around doing nothing rather than create new work. Humans will adapt as they always have.
The faster the minimum wage rises, the more money there is for automation.  Jobs that are not cost effective to automate at $7 are easy to automate at $15.  Tens of millions of them

The good news is that some jobs are just too hard to automate:

[Slaughterhouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZIv6WtSF9I)

[Deboning Fish](http://gizmodo.com/this-machine-perfectly-filets-and-de-bones-fish-with-x-1511542681?trending_test_e&amp;utm_expid=66866090-62.H_y_0o51QhmMY_tue7bevQ.5&amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com)

This is why you don't elect a president to just mindlessly jack up your minimum wage to the point that all your jobs are lost.


No one will have any money to buy mass produced products. 
My question is, who's going to pay for the goods that are manufactured?
This is how it will happen. It is such a perfect piece.

Robots will mine our materials, make our product, cook our food, clean our houses, and so much more. Nit to mention there will be robots specifically designed to repair said robots, and they can repair each other. Mass unemployment will happen, but at that point its mostly a mass "everything is free and made for me by robots" lifestyle
Many people are saying that there are only two options if this is to happpen: ditch capitalism for a form of society where some work and others don't, along with large taxes and large handouts, or have a mass split between the rich and the poor. 

What's wrong exactly with attempting to keep capitalism, but put more people into the workforce of engineering and sciences, the fields that created this automation? I know that there are only so many jobs in these fields, but I'm sure it's not impossible to expand the amount of positions that these fields require to make up for a lot more people.

I'm thinking this because I don't think mass automation should be the end of human progress, and if we were to enter a society where many people don't work, I fear human progress in many scientific fields will drop drastically. 

What thoughts do everyone have on shifting to a society like that? 
I for one, welcome our new robotic overlords 
If there isn't enough work to go around, we could double the minimum wage and put a 20-hr/week cap on labor.
ITT people who have read too much science fiction and are super paranoid about robots
I thought this was obvious.  It seems strange to me that we aren't there yet frankly, life would be simpler if we didn't have to work or have money, but a mans value was his word and actions.  I'm a bit of an idealist thiugh
Won't happen. Or atleast it won't be the robots fault if it does.

People said the same thing about industrialization. Think about how many billions of people used to have jobs farming that a single guy with a combine can do now. A single person can work the same area that used to take hundreds or thousands. There is ALWAYS more work. So long as people want to do something, you can pay someone to do it for you, and human desire is unlimited.

What creates unemployment is not technological advances, and people who write these articles show a fundamental lack of understanding of how the world works. What creates unemployment is:

1.) insufficient natural resources to work with OR 2.) concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals so that it's hard to effectively trade skills for most the population.

Unfortunately for us, with population growth and the way politics is at the moment, I see both being a problem.
**Yesterday on Reddit:** Trump wants to get rid of 11 million illegals, PANIC, who will do all the jobs nobody wants!?!

**Day later on reddit:** There won't be any jobs left, robots will take them all!?!?

Which is it reddit, will there be no one to fill jobs or no jobs to fill, can't have it both ways.
My predictions for when this happen:

While the rest of the world figures out how to deal with this, becoming more and more socialist in the process and adopting things like basic income out of sheer necessity, the US stays as capitalistic and conservative as ever. Automation leaves many without a job, with little being done to help them figure out how to go on in this new age. Rhetoric on how socialism/communism destroys countries and leaves everyone poor grows ever stronger. Republicans, encouraged by lobbies and corporations, manage to convince the common denominator that measures such as basic income or free education are un-Christian, or that if such measures are passed, it will tax the poor even more, straining the unemployed and lower wage even further. Not only that, but the rich are strained as well, and that could one day be them. If such rhetoric isn't enough, and social welfare policies are passed, they'll be sabotaged. Know how Obamacare wasn't as good as was promised, and in some states actually made things worse for those whose lives were supposed to be improved by it? That will happen even more so, partly in an effort to prove how bad socialism is, partly in an effort to get those policies scrapped. As differences between rich and poor begin to rival African nations and socioeconomic mobility reaches an all time low (insofar as it hasn't already), the US collapses under its own weight. The disaster the country had long coming, has now finally arrived, unable to adapt to modern times. 
Wait, we are in an age of mass employment ?

Why didn't anyone tell me ?

considering the population is slated to double, thats going to leave  A LOT of unemployed people out there. So how are adjustments going to be made to the economy to do something about that. Bored people are destructive.

This being old news tho.
I not worried.
Not a could, a will.

And with the income disparity supported by laws like citizens united, the poor are going to find themselves obsoleted...

Then we'll need a real war to thin them out.
Skynet will take care of everything.
why is ai being pursued? its an exciting technology but I cant imagine scenarios where its going to better humanity if its applied on a large scale
To be followed by mass unemployment and the killing of the poors
So what the hell is the general population going to do when theyre all out of work? 
Duhhhhhh
But wouldn't robots doing everything mean that mass unemployment is being caused?
This kinda contradicts the idea of capitalism, where the actual value of a product or service is created when a person is spending their time and effort in producing that product or service.

In other words, robots won't be earning anything and won't be spending/consuming anything. 

Someone said about if we manage to "share" the riches amongst us, then you're talking socialism, my friend.

So, robots and AI replacing humans in production of goods and services equals socialism.
Then what happens to the economy?  Will I see a Star Trek economy in my lifetime? 
Man I really hope I'm dead by the time that happens.
They will still need employees to make the AI and robotics.

This has always been the fear of technology but I've heard that overall new technology has always resulted in more jobs.
They have been saying machines would replace humans for a 100 years.   
Wonder if they'll replace so many jobs that there won't be a market for the goods they are producing.
we need to deport these damn illegal robots! they're taking our jobs!

I know...let's build a wall!
Not fun reading this after a marathon of Ghost in the Shell.

The world changes but one thing will stay the same: people are bad at predicting the future. 
Omg, it's so capitalism's fault not technology's. It's like people are on board with the premise when a CEO says "well, we *can* lay off thousands of people, so I guess we sort of *have to*."
Automation in a proper developed country, say Norway, would probably result in something like a 95% top marginal tax rate and a universal guaranteed income equivalent to 2 or 3 thousand US dollars per month. Some countries are already seriously mulling over the notion of universal income. Why is everyone so worried about an industrial revolution that is most likely to hasten that process?
Thankfully this wont affect nurses....no robot can put you on a bedpan six times in 3 hours, fluff your pillows "just so" and give you narcotics all in the span of 1 shift
How will we house and feed ourselves?
When I read stuff like this I can't help but fantasize about a world where the robots do all the work humans don't want to and then we all get to spend our time however we please... This is assuming that wealth was distributed in a way to allow us not to work 
so why the hell are we letting so many unskilled workers immigrate to the places where these robots will take over?
_The Naked Sun_ for the lucky few 
But instead of everybody working less, a few will just not work at all, while all the plebs are stuck doing things a robot can't.
Eventually we should just have the robots do every single job then we can just chill our whole lives and have the robots get us or make us what we want whenever with certain restrictions obviously 
Better pull up those bootstraps.

So we don't have to work anymore? Booyah!!
There was a website, I will try and find it. It basically tells you the likelihood that your job could be replaced by automation. I searched for my field, architecture and said 0.2%, then I searched something like accounting and it said 95%
Though bad for a lot of menial jobs, many of the jobs that have been lost to China, due to lower overheads, will return to the west.  These factories will need some humans to run and maintain them, so some jobs will be created.

But if you're a truck driver for example, your knackered.  Nobodies prepared to pay any extra for certain jobs that offer no real value or skill.  These are the jobs that machines will take-up and there will be massive job losses.

We'll see a massive rise in artisans and craftsman to make up for those jobs lost in unskilled labour, but expect many to lose their jobs.  Immigration for the non-skilled will become impossible, asylum-seekers will be given no right to work.  Borders will be defended vociferously.

On the plus side they'll be massive deflation in goods and living costs.  Things like apartment blocks will be built in no time and people wont need enormous mortgages to own an apartment. So be beholden to the jobs they're in.  So unemployment and more leisure time will become more common.

AI will massively increase R&amp;D, reducing time between developments.  Many people will live longer, healthier lives, with age becoming less and less of an issue.  Unfortunately, having a job might be one of the things some people wont be able to do.  Meaning a minority of the population may well live shorter lives, from depression, ill health, motivation and an aim in life.
So basically dystopian society happens when lack of funds and increased population/demand for resources collide?
Then our work week will be down to 10 hours!

PROGRESS!
After all those years of insisting that "there's no such thing as technological unemployment" the economists are finally starting to twig on to something the scientists and futurists have known for decades, and it only took until years after it started happening. Continuing the discipline's unbroken record of perfect post hoc predictions. Probably too damn late, of course. 

I've always thought that the way science moves these days, having all our economic and social policy determined and analyzed by people who don't know anything at all about technology is remarkably stupid, but you just can't beat that economics aura. 
Yeah right. Our prime minister (nz) made the same promise if "mass surveillance " of the public was revealed.when it was eventually revealed he just pretended it had never happened.
Here in Ireland, the IRA was (is?) involved for many years in a [criminal enterprise of laundering Irish Agricultural Green Diesel](http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/business-as-usual-for-former-ira-bosss-fuellaundering-operations-29146906.html), removing the green dye and selling it over the border in Northern Ireland at a greatly marked down price (tax free agriculture diesel in the Republic costs 70 cent a liter but laundered diesel sells for €1.30 - €1.35 in the North). most of these fuel laundering operations were along the border, just on the Irish side, they pumped laundered fuel into northern Ireland via hidden pipelines or in disguised milk or slurry tanks.

The process in ISIS territory is similar. There's dozens if not hundreds of small refineries run by small oil businesses ISIS territory. They distill crude oil into diesel, cooking and heating fuel, they then sell distillate on to middle men who sell it on to yet other middle men who transport it out of Syria. ISIS taxes this operation. 

Also, everyone buys oil products originating from ISIS territory not just Turkey but also Syria and Iraq (they claim there's pipelines that smuggle fuel across the border into Turkey).

Just to prove that the oil isn't just heading to Turkey, here's footage of Jets destroying 116 oil trucks at [Abu Kamal](http://www.nationsonline.org/maps/syria-map.jpg), a border town at the south-east corner of Syria, next to Iraq.

https://youtu.be/hXvrfmzH05M?t=7s

Edit: Yes it's just the same as Northern Ireland and the IRA's laundered diesel. The tax on diesel in Turkey is very high, the middle men buy dirt cheap ISIS origin diesel and sell it to Turkey, .... and Syria, the Rebels, the Kurds and Iraq.

&gt;While global oil prices have fallen, Turkish fuel prices continue to increase, as recent figures from the Energy Market Regulatory Agency (EPDK) show that customers are paying twice or more in taxes than they are for the gasoline itself.

and

&gt;A report published by Bloomberg late last year showed Turkey as having the second most expensive gas prices in the world after Norway, a country where income levels make buying gas comparatively much more affordable.

[What is laundered Fuel?](http://www.thejournal.ie/laundered-fuel-ireland-579896-Sep2012/)
Hard to prove if he "disposes" of all reporters looking into it. 

Turkey doesn't buy directly from Daesh. They buy through the turkish traders on the border who are at peace with ISIS.
Yeah right. This man will never resign. So much of his corruption has been leaked and proven over the years and he has managed to weasel his way out. If anyone gets close to proving this they'll be offed or thrown away like the journalists recently. 
This is simply nonsense.  Even if legitimate proof was provided, Erdogan can simply call it fake.  Same thing goes with Arms deals.
Oh yea and when Russia or US prove the link with ISIS he's gonna say that's not what I ment
"I will resign if..." Bullshit. No matter what is proven or how, no politician will ever stand by their word if it means losing power. They have so much less to lose lying than they do carrying through on that kind of promise. 
Calling it, anyone who will try to prove this from within the country will be killed/put in jail and if anyother country shows satelite images to prove it, they will be called fake :&gt;
How is that even possible when you've thrown all the good journalists in jail?
That sort of thing is scientifically provable without necessarily following the oil all the way along.  You would need some samples of crude oil from the various fields in Syria from before the war, do some geochemistry on what's being brought into Turkey, and then match them up.  Geochemical fingerprinting like that is routinely done to determine the source of oil spills or smuggling, so it isn't particularly difficult.  Each field is fairly unique.  If the field from which the oil is derived happens to be within Daesh/ISIS-held territory, then Erdogan can get busy either backpedalling or resigning.

But even without doing that kind of careful work, if you simply overlay a map of where the oil fields in Syria are located and where ISIS/ISIL/Daesh are in control, it is fairly obvious there's a good chance that any smuggled oil coming from Syria is ultimately from ISIS, even if there might be middlemen involved and the Kurds could also be a source too.

For example, there are *no* fields to the west in the area around, say, Aleppo.  Most of the fields are located just SW of Raqqah, or along the Euphrates River heading towards Iraq and extending to the north just inside the Syria-Iraq border.  The only fields that don't appear to be obviously within ISIS control are far in the NE  in Kurdish areas along the Turkish border and a small pocket of regime control at Deir Ez-Zor (which is trapped in the middle of ISIS territory anyway).  So, only the Kurds could be a source of non-ISIS-tainted oil smuggled into Turkey, and if any is coming across the Turkey-Syria border between the Euphrates and Aleppo, it's almost certainly from ISIS.

Soo.. Since everyone here is so sure of turkey buing oil from ISIS, can you guys share that solid evidence of this with me too?
Turkey and ISIS  http://www.businessinsider.com/links-between-turkey-and-isis-are-now-undeniable-2015-7
thats what i call turkish delight
US and its allies back him. The remaining powers are only Russia and China that can deliver the proofs. China has no interests in overthrowing him. So we got only Russia. Any true or false proof that can be delivered by Russia will be denounced and deemed unfounded by the US and the west and thus Erdogan remains. THAT IS WHY ERDOGAN SAID THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
Serious question. Why is it OK to buy oil from Saudi Arabia a country that crucifies it's citizens and financially supports IS, but not from IS directly?
Somebody better get his hat and coat for him.
will putin do this? 
[deleted]
If a reporter is thrown in jail because he had proof, but now it can't be proven because the guy with the proof is in jail, then was it really ever proven at all?
I love it when dictators say shit like this. 

Translation: "I will never ever ever ever ever ever resign ever!" 

P.S.: Go fuck your mother.
Haha Erdoğan says this *after* he has locked up the journalist who has proven this..he's sooo funny..

Blackmarket oil from ISIS indirectly makes it to just about everyone in the region.. including Assad

The Russians are just masters of the information war, and by making this claim (the Turks don't directly trade oil with ISIS), they put Turkey on the defensive.. also this type of propaganda sells well domestically to Russians who have little information to the contrary

Somehow i feel that anyone who tries to investigate and get evidence on that will meet an "accidental" death.
Make it happen, please make it happen. This man is absolute vermin

They should make an agreement that the loser must wear their wife's best Sunday dress to the next United Nations conference
Discussing resignation is easy when no possible proof will be considered legit. 
I wouldn't be surprised if this turned out to be true. Take a look at [this report](http://ig.ft.com/sites/2015/isis-oil/). Notice how Turkey doesn't even have to be in the picture for ISIS to pocket hefty profits off of its oil facilities. I think it's more likely that Turkey has some other types of shady dealing with ISIS (arms, explosives, etc.) but not oil. 
"Blood Oil" Staring Leonardo DiCaprio, coming 2016.
For people who don't know about the source: The source (Sabah) is owned by Erdogan's son-in-law who became a minister recently. After 2005, Erdogan's party started a move to control mass-media. The government seized several big broadcast and publishing businesses through threats and blackmail. The most commonly used tactic was to jail the media bosses for tax-evasion charges. After that, the company would be seized and the control would be transferred to a pro-Erdogan board through a shady auction process. There are many newspapers and tv stations now in Turkey like Sabah which only run pro-government propaganda. 
Seriously? The dude's son deals with Daesh directly. The oil trucks that Russia bombed belonged to Erdogan jr.
If he actually resigns it'll probably be the first thing I've heard about him that I like.  Better chance of hell freezing over though.  
I'd love Anonymous to do something here.

Why are people in Turkey buying cheap tax free ISIS fuel?

That's the reason.

If Erdoğan truly opposes ISIS, that his troops just stood by and did absolutely nothing while ISIS captured Kobani...right on the Turkish border. Can anyone seriously imagine any other 'European' nation behaving that way while terrorists capture an entire town right on their border ? I find it crazy that Turkey is still even in NATO...let alone than any fools ever thought of allowing it entry into the EU.

And it is high time western leaders offered proper support for the Kurds, and demanded their right to a homeland with the same vigour that they do for Israel.
[Putin](https://j.gifs.com/y3jkA4.gif)
How is it a 'misleading title'? That's exactly what he said.
And of course, his definition of "proven" is "I decide that the person saying it is correct".
I'm sure Russians will find evidence just like they found the [US APMY stingers in Ukraine](http://i.imgur.com/BEvVuhv.png)
This seems like a trap to draw out anti-Erdogan journalists.
How many countries border Syria? Israel, Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan &amp; Iraq. As one redditor stated, both Russia and US probably have the capabilities to monitor where that Oil that is funding much of ISIS operations, is going.  But they, (USA) are not doing a thing about it which suggests they are covering for someone who is more than likely an ally. Lots of chatter suggests that in a way, US is supporting ISIS  indirectly by using them to take down the Assad gov't.  If this is in fact true, USA is more implicit than even Turkey, and then we are having a much different conversation.

And then there's always this true or untrue as it may be?
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-11-25/meet-man-who-funds-isis-bilal-erdogan-son-turkeys-president

hard to prove if he arrests every journalist that apposes him 
&gt;In his statement, the president underlined Turkey's commintment to fight Daesh terror in every possible way, saying that he will resign from his post if any oil purchase from Daesh is proven. Erdoğan said, "If such an allegation is proven, I will no longer sit at this post. I call onto Putin, would you?"

&gt;President also said that Russia's claim that Turkey bought oil from Daesh terrorist organization is not 'moral', adding "such claims have to be proved."

&gt;Further emphasizing that the countries Turkey buys oil from is 'known', he said: "We buy from Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Qatar and Nigeria. We won't accept such slanders."

I find it funny how he's not saying "Turkey did not buy any oil from Daesh," but instead he's saying "If you can *prove* Turkey bought oil from Daesh then I'll resign."
Who's next in line?
But if it is not proven 
&gt; Erdoğan challanges Putin to resign if he can't prove Turkey buys oil from Daesh.

How old is this man again? Are we sure he is not still in kindergarden?
anyone check if his fingers were crossed?  pretty sure he's pulled that one before
better get ready to resign then

Classic Reagan/Bush/Bush/Clinton/Obama tactic: swear to something and then come on TV a week later forcibly saying "actually guys I lied lol str8 up" and get clapped off like a hero
suck it, pootin 
This just makes me think that he's REALLY confident about how well he's covered his tracks. 

Think about it, unless he knows where every single purchase of oil comes from (unrealistic) there's no way for him to know for certain that there is no Daesh link. On the other hand, if he knew they were covering/obfuscating the actual Daesh purchases he just needs to know about what's going on with those as all the others are clean.
Why is everyone saying daesh now?
Never mind him resigning. If Turkey is proven to be buying oil from ISIS, it needs to be kicked out of NATO.
Here's the trick, the people who prove it have to live to get it to trial... in Turkey.
Translation: our oil purchases from Daesh are really well obfuscated.
Got a few Turkish friends who are probably really hoping for some proven Daesh oil purchases.
Is this a lord of the rings character?  Elf?
ISIS ISIL AND NOW Daesh? FUCKING PICK ONE NAME FFS!!
This is turning into "he said...she said" high school girl gossip. 
Ohhhhh, this is a big deal! 
Regardless of this oil issue, the sickeningly clear appearance that Erdogan's government (with or without his direct involvement) ordered the recent mass-casualty terrorist attack on dissenters protesting his regime makes it impossible to trust him.  

At this point I would be advising NATO to develop a plan to decouple from Turkey, because it's devolving into outright, unexaggerated fascism.  It's going to fuck us up one way or another, but better as a jilted former colleague than a country whose increasingly insane behavior ends up being blamed on NATO.

*in Turkish court.
He would never resign. 
Liar liar pants on fire.
Please please prove it and let him resign 
What constitutes proof? That his son is involved in oil smuggling?
no he won't.
And any evidence will be dismissed as a Western conspiracy backed by the Zionists.
Spoiler Alert: no he won't. 
This title sounds like it's straight out of Middle Earth.
The process in ISIS territory in the US and the Kurds could also be a source too.
Of course it won't be proven, it's his SON who is managing the company embezzling the oil. Not too hard to "keep it in the family"
This is such a convenient argument to make. Every political leader does this when they come under pressure. They know that people's memories are very short. And most investigations, if any, will drag down for years. And this is Turkey where journalists are put into jails for "defaming" their dear leader. This is all a fuckin joke.

Little stinking weasel.   A plane violates his airspace for 6 seconds and he shoots it down, but somehow he misses the miles of trucks lining up for Turkey loaded with ISIS crude.
Why hasn't somebody put 147 grains into this fuck-knuckle's brainstem?  
Not DAESH's oil. He just drinks their milkshake.
Russia and morals. Apples and Oranges.
Lets find proof like we found those Bostom bombers.
&gt; Relations between Russia and Turkey have nosedived since Russia's violation of Turkish airspace last week.

This is such a great political pun and it was delivered with the reporting equivalent of a straight face. I am flabbergasted 

he will do no 

such thing

if you are debating 

with a con man

the con man 

is winning
Turkey is well known for their ability to deny their own wrong doings.  

Who now remembers the Armenians?
Erdogan is a dog that has held Turkey back for years and is only watching out for himself, serious Arafat vibes
I thought countries were trying to deescalate the situation
resigning and giving up power are two different things 
Rev up those resignation letters.
Resign? They should shoot you for treason I'd they find any proof of it. 
No he won't.
http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/jlaw-whtvr.gif
Even if someone proves it, he won't.
I can sense putin smiling, just telling people to find the proof and if none actually exist to make it.
And he'll just lawyer his way around any proof being valid to avoid actually resigning.
Again: A simple: "No we don't" would have been enough. Now you force us to investigate.
Ken Ham:  I will resign of any evolutionary claim is proven
Can't wait.
Speaking of tempting fate.
Tayyip will not resign if Allah himself appears again and tells him to go.
Challenge accepted
Sultans never resign
Oh don't you worry big cat. Russian hackers for hire and well on their way to getting the info. 
I want to see [Exxon, BP and Shell](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mef45egjmi/8-royal-dutch-shell-3-7-/) have to prove the exact same thing - or face criminal charges for consorting with the enemy.
Don't get my hopes up, Erdogan. 
Present video or audio and they'll call it a montaj. Nothing would pass his burden of proof so he can say it with a straight face.
are they going to set their own remind mes?
That's going to be hard without Russian gas.
Good thing russia cut him off so he cant buy anymore to be proven eh?
He is just doing bluff. We all know he is not gonna do that even if it would be proven.

Edit: grammer
Get to work people!!
SOMEONE GET SHERLOCK ON THE CASE!

THE GAME IS ON, MOTHERFUCKERS!
How do you pronounce his name?
Does it really matter? Oil is fungible, so the fact that anybody is buying oil from Daesh is enough to affect the global prices. Just because Turkey does not buy from Daesh does not mean that they, and everybody else, don't benefit from Daesh's oil sales. 
I'll believbe it when it happens.
Forget the oil.

Turkey, as a Nato member, are doing what the US wants them to do - antagonise Russia as much as possible.

If Russia succeeds in abandoning the dollar, she and China will sail off into the sunset while the US collapses. So the US intends to use all its vassals as cannon fodder. UK and France are next.
yeah sure and irak had weapons of mass destruction. btw murica where are these weapons ?
We can do this reddit !!!
Reminds me of the time that Obama said he would take action if there was ever a chemical weapons attack in Syria.

Fuck Turkey
Can the Turks just rise up and remove him? Kthx.
Shots fired!
Considering it's already been proven, here's hoping this slimeball is telling the truth for once. 

How many people died in Gezi again? 
We got this reddit I'm sure we could dig some shit up on this guy somehow!
Spoiler alert: He isnt going to resign.
Spoiler: no, he won't. 
Turkish traders buying it from ISIS, which is then given to Turkish government for $$

If he IS caught, he will just lie and say he had no idea the traders were buying it from ISIS lol
Erdogan: Your son has a fleet of trucks and boats bringing it in. Ask him!
As valid as various "I will eat shoes" bets on reddit.
What's actually going to happen: some journalist is going to prove it, but Erdogan will deny it, construct some conspiracy theory, throw the journalist in jail under false premises, and continue his dictatorial rule.
Everyone should check out Mao's "Let 100 flowers bloom" initiative.

He didn't even have religion going for him and it was a success!
I just cannot wait to see this guy get what's coming to him. Whenever his death happens, I hope he has a long time to ponder his life while in hell
[...and you just put reddit on the case!](http://i.imgur.com/7W1S9PZ.jpg)
Fear not, Turkish brothers.  Soon Bernie will be elected.  You will be liberated by the new logical military policy of the US.  A global revolution is coming.  Fascists and tyrants will be crushed by Bernie and His policies.  The world will soon be free!
Good. He's bad for Turkey.
Alright gang, lets split up and look for clues
But are they buying from Saudi Arabia, who everyone knows is exactly the same as ISIS?
Liar. 
and how about weapons? 
Jeez. This is like the Mumbai attacks all over again. Same model, similar death toll.

Absolutely tragic.
Can't believe they just massacred *100* people in the concert hall. That's unfathomable.

Some news from Germany:

A week ago a 51yo man from Montenegro was arrested near Rosenheim, Germany. He was transporting several pistols, revolvers, MPs, ammunition and TNT.  

According to reports there are indications that he was heading to Paris. 

The press is speculating that he might have been an additional terrorist.  Though the police say he might have been "just" an arms dealer.  

Source (German): http://www.br.de/nachrichten/schleierfahnder-attentat-paris-100.html
Jesus. I was surprised when I saw 15 a few hours ago.
What is the point of all of this? 

Why?
One of the problems with this kind of terrorism is our inability as a society to have a rational discussion about the costs and methods of addressing it. The sort of trauma that this induces seems to lead to little more than calls for more bombing and or increased on the ground troops to fight rebel groups in the middle east. There is little discussion of cost or any kind of metrics to determine the actual effectiveness of these courses of action. Then there is the inevitable clamp down of civil liberties and no discussion of the fact that your odds of getting killed by a terrorist are minuscule in spite of incidents like this. What moments like this call for is some wider context and outside the box thinking, but it seems like everyone is just going to hunker down into their political boxes and stick to the script. Oh well.
These radicals literally behave like a macro cancer.

Difficult to quickly detect, distinguish, and isolate.

Their functions are to replicate themselves uncontrollably and destroy the healthy.

If allowed to continue, they would completely destroy the very things that allow them to exist.
The bombs that blew up outside the stadium might have been intended to get inside. If they had somehow gotten in, things would have been much much worse.
Radical Islam needs to die. 
I see things like this happen and just feel numb. I'm sitting on my couch on the verge of going on a nice vacation and realize how lucky I am. Humanity is a hell of a thing. I got lucky.
Terror is a disease. It eats away at a person, or a group, or a whole country like a cancer. It cripples tourism and economy, it stifles growth, individually and on a national level, it holds us back as individuals and as a whole. Regardless, of the race, religion or creed of the attackers, they are terrorists. If a white man walks into a movie theater with an assault rifle and starts firing into the crowd because he wants someone to remember his name, he is a terrorist. If a brown guy walks into a concert and opens fire because his religion tells him to, he is a terrorist. Terror, like cancer, inhibits healing. It destroys from the inside out and it never quite lets the wound heal, it just eats away at the corners, getting a little bigger each time it strikes. 

Tonight, many many people had their lives cut short, and a nation suffered a blow that was meant to terrorize and cripple them. And while that blow was devastating, it was far from crippling. Instead of being terrified, the people of France stood their ground, mobilized their forces, rallied the world, and opened their doors to provide shelter to those who needed it. The hospitals and first responders were caught unaware, and still rallied with incredible speed and numbers. Those who were able to throw open their doors and welcome scared, sometimes injured people into their homes, did so, and I've no doubt lives were saved because of it. Those who could do nothing but hold a camera, held a camera. Doctors were not too terrorized to report to the hospitals, police and military were not too terrorized to step in and minimize the threat, and citizens were not too terrorized to open their homes and provide safe passage. 

In their immediate goal, which was to hurt and kill and make a statement, they succeeded, but in their overall goal of causing terror and dealing a lasting blow, they failed. That, in my opinion, was the single most important thing to show them, that they failed. More so than all the outrage that is flowing off the internet tonight, the silent refusal to be bullied was the perfect response. 

Paris, we weep with you, we mourn with you, we stand with you. 
What can you really say to such cruel and stupid individuals.
Fuck man. This is bullshit.
Holy fucking...shit. My mouth just dropped to the floor when I read this. 100 + 58 people dead. How could this happen? This is unfathomable savagery. No, this is what we humans call evil.
I just wish the media outlets would clarify that EoDM don't actually play death metal, and even if they did, that it would in no way mean that their fans love death. I get the feeling many people are gonna think badly about the band and their fans.
Very sad, more hate and mistrust in the world.

Condolences to Paris from Pakistan.
Possibly dumb question, but I'm drunk, emotional, and trying to wrap my head around this shit.

TL;DR: How does ISIS think it's a good idea to give the West and Russia a common enemy?

What is ISIS's larger strategy here? Beyond the barbarism and everything else, this just doesn't seem like good war strategy by ISIS. What I mean is, if ISIS wants war and bloodshed against the West and Russia, isn't the superior strategy to engage in a way that causes the West and Russia to continue to be at odds with each other? Divide and conquer and all that. Attacking a Russian plane and then Paris basically back-to-back can only serve to unite the West and Russia against a common threat. Basically, instead of that, wouldn't ISIS want to antagonize Russia, and let Russia be isolated on the world stage in any military actions, and only attack the West whenever Russia starts to tire of military force, this way Russia is engaged in war when the West wants peace and the West starts beating the war drums when Russia is seeking peace. Instead, ISIS has presented itself as a common enemy of Russia and the West. What the hell is their strategy?
I was just listening to Carl Sagan talk about how an alien civilization might find the golden record aboard the Voyager spacecraft and ask, "Have they destroyed themselves, or gone on to greater things?" I hope that during trying times like these, we can find the courage to look beyond our own small perspectives and work towards a future that is not built on a foundation of hatred and intolerance.




This shit tears me up. I'm literally torn between immense sadness and rage and it's a very uncomfortable feeling. I honestly can't even fathom how anyone could do this to other human beings. It's disgusting.

 I'm an atheist and I couldn't give a flying fuck less what god or gods you believe in or how/where/when you want to worship said god(s). But why, why do these people care so much about their religion vs "infidels" that they go to these lengths? These people are making all Muslims look bad. 

 I honestly have a hard time believing it's even about religion anymore for them, it's about power. But then how do you explain the people suicide bombing? They must sincerely believe in some afterlife and that they're doing the right thing... 

I don't know it hurts my brain to think about it.
I hope this will bring critical thinking to the table, and not just some empty sorry speech about this tragedy.

Without countermeasures this is bound to happen again.
ISIS and all these Islamic radicals are so fucking chicken shit. They talk a big game when they're attacking defenseless civilians but they get stomped into the fucking ground when they go up against soldiers ready to fight. 

The fact that they yelled "this is for Syria" makes my blood boil. Yeah because some random guy in Paris is responsible for any of that right? Why not take the fight to Assad instead? Because he'll fight back?

Chicken shit, all of them. 
Growing up I never worried while I was in public. I could take my bike all over my small little section of the world and everything seemed limitless and full of adventure. As an adult I have to wonder if I'm going to get shot going to a movie or concert. Not by someone who wants to take my property but by someone who just wants to take a life and mine is no different to any other in their eyes. 

Truly terrifying. 
You could wipe ISIS off the map and this isuse would still present itself. Extremism is now a concept rather than a group and I don't see it going away.
Damn it. Sometimes I wish I was Goku. 
To any french people reading this, I am sorry that this has happened.  I'm an American and remember how supportive the french were on 9/11/2001.  Nothing I can say can make it better.  I just want to express my sympathies.  
Man... Fuck radical Muslims.
[deleted]
128 deaths, 258 wounded and 99 between the life and death
According to french TV
[deleted]
Do we have any heroic stories yet?  

I could use some of that right about now...
People need to get a little bit of perspective.  
  
This thread is filled with people saying "I can't believe this happened". Well, believe it, because it's reality. This sort of suffering is not even that uncommon. 160 deaths is a pretty mild day in Syria. It's just not that common in the West. 
  
The fact of the matter is we're fighting a proxy war. We backed some rebels in hopes that they'd help install a more favorable government, and it backfired because the instability gave rise to ISIS. Now, Russia is backing the original Syrian government to fight ISIS, and this whole debocle has destroyed millions of lives. That's the facts.  
  
For those who are curious [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3iqnMcQDRnw) illustrates the point pretty well. Us westerners created ISIS. We didn't actually found them, but we created the conditions that have led to their rise. If you watch the videos, you see they quickly claim almost all of the territory that had been taken by the rebels we sponsored.   
  
An amount of western collateral damage should be expected. I'm not saying it's right, I'm not saying it's not horrible, but it's not something more disasterous than the rest of the horrors of this conflict. A life is a life, be it a Syrian, Iraqi, American, or French. If you're truly shocked by this, it implies that you're not paying too much attention to all of the usual horrors and atrocities that happen on a daily basis.  
  
It reminds me of that joker meme: a few thousand Syrians are killed in a failed U.S. coup, and no one bat's an eye, but a couple hundred white people get shot, and the whole world loses their minds.  
  
This is real life, and this is why it's dangerous to fight proxy wars. If you can't handle this, you need to toughen up, because things don't look likley to improve any time soon. We've gotten ourselves into a real pile of shit now. There's a very serious chance that ISIS could win in Syria/Iraq, and this is going to be *bad*.  
  
Anyone who supported the original Iraq war should feel like a complete idiot at this point, because being greeted as liberators is not actually what happens. People would rather be ruled by local dictators than foreign Democracies, and we're going to have to either rain fire on these people, to just pulverize them into submission like the Mongol's or the Romans or anyone else who's successfully conquered the region, or we just need to stop fucking around over there completely. These half-measures are creating a very dangerous situation. 
  
Anyway, if you can't believe that a decade of western military action could cause a little bit of blowback, you should reassess you familiarity with the current geopolitical ecosystem. This is horrible, but horrible is all the time.
 I am [afraid](http://imgur.com/z3RYiVW) for France, and for Europe
I think in terms of human history, radical islamic terrorism may be one of the most insidious ideologies we've ever come across. It's absolutely infuriating what monsters these people are, completely deranged animals with warped minds. So sick and tired of it. 
What if they get access to Chemical weapons, Nuclear bombs.. this thought disturbs me..
There has to be a multifaceted approach to this. It can't be as simple as either extreme of 'bomb the crap out of Syria' or 'accept everyone unconditionally'. There is no one answer. 

First: It is important that the heads of ISIS be cut off. I think we can all agree on that. But it's important to not only do that in a human sense, but also in a metaphorical sense. The battle against Wahabbism and violent Islam needs to be fought in every Mosque in the world. The more Muslims condemn ISIS, the weaker they will become. 

Second: It's extremely important that we don't let this devolve into a blood feud between Muslims and non-Muslims, as the far-right would have happen. That's playing right into ISIS' hands - they want an us-versus-them situation where mainstream Muslims feel rejected by civilized society and become more malleable into the extremist image. It is *very* important to continue to promote integration and companionship between different religions. Kill ISIS with kindness, including supply drops to civilians in Syria with a big sign on that says 'a gift from the free world, come and join in'. 

Third: Education to these places. Western society is - and don't give me any apologist PC BS - clearly better than theirs. We don't stone women to death for daring to have premarital sex, we don't beat them for daring to drive a car, we don't enslave people with a different religion, and we don't have the death penalty for gay people among other things which are *clearly better*. It's important to both do this at home and fund efforts in those countries to do the same. 

Finally: These things alone aren't enough and all the pacifist liberalism in the world won't stop ISIS on its own, and it is important to fund and support efforts by the Kurds, the Iraqi Army and others like them to defend against ISIS. I'd also suggest trying a more pragmatic approach to Al-Assad. The enemy of your enemy is your friend, and even if he is a despicable man, he's better than ISIS - possibly offer him amnesty if he agrees to step down after ISIS' defeat or something similar. 
Why is the religion of peace so violent?
Impossible to discuss any measures to prevent the spread of Islam in Europe as it's 'racist'. But time and time again it's being proven that Islam is incompatible with European life. Whether the child raping islamic sex gangs and butchering of Soldiers in the streets of the UK, the mass shooting of innocent people in France or the general feeling of unease for natives of Europe. It's time measures were taken against Islam!
"We may remove bigoted or hateful comments, including those directed towards any race, religion, ethnic group, nationality, gender, or sexual orientation"   Fair enough, but one of those is a choice.  Religion is an idea, and ideas are fair to be ridiculed.  You can delete comments that ridicule religion...but you shouldn't.
I cant wait for Russia to wipe them off the earth
I use to feel safe in Canada,  I'm not so sure anymore...  France has been through so much this year, stay strong.
Yesterday there were reports that one terrorist was arrested and he admitted he was with ISIS. Today they speak about all of them being killed. What happened to this one who was arrested?
How exactly does killing innocent people, along with yourself, get you into Heaven?
No doubt the suicide bombers at the stadium were trying to get inside, and either couldn't get access or their bombs went off prematurely.  It could have been a lot worse.
I wish there was a nuke that would only hit the bad guys and blow all the good people to safety. That's such a first grade idea..
This is just such a tragic situation, and will continue to be in its aftermath. 
Regardless of who or why, the senseless loss of life is disgusting. France has survived numerous tragedies, including two world wars, and she will come out of this stronger than before. It takes the worst in people to cause such a tragedy, and it's sad that it often takes such a tragedy to bring out the best in people. Love from America to our allies. Vive LA France! 
"We are going to lead a war which will be pitiless. Because when terrorists are capable of comitting such atrocities, they must be certain that they are facing a determined France, a united France, a France that is together, and does not let itself be moved, even if today we express infinite sorrow." - French President Hollande 

Good. Fuck ISIS. 
Best wishes for everyone in France
Pretty much proof all the security at places like airports are just theater. If terrorists really want it cause maximum damage (death toll, economic and to society) they just need to pick random targets on any given Friday night and they can shut down an entire country 
The shooters and bombers in this terrorist attack are cowards and weak minded. 
I'm in Kyrgyzstan and the news reports a shooter saying "this is for Syria" 
Indian PM said yesterday there would have been no guns if Sufism was the main sect of Islam. Even Shias, zikris, ibadis they are quite peaceful. Its the Sunni tenets which creatres problem. I don't hate muslims but the religion specifically Sunni, is fucked up.
Welp.... time to close that border it looks like.

It pisses me off so much that either way ISIS gets what it fucking wants, western soliders in their territory. I'm torn between having our men and women getting caught up in ANOTHER war in the middle east or continuing the bombing campaign. 
I can't even put to words how upset this makes me, as an American.

Why France?  Why *again*?

This was a cowardly act of war on unarmed, unsuspecting civilians.

I know we don't always see eye to eye, but France is America's most valued ally, without whom we wouldn't even be a country.  That is a debt we can never repay; but that won't stop us from trying.

All the world is watching to see how France reacts to this.  For my part, I hope they invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty; but I'm an American, and it's a case of "when you're a hammer, every problem looks like a nail".  With luck, they'll find a way to keep themselves safe without sacrificing their freedoms and without a war.

If they *do* decide on war, however, there's no country more ready and willing to offer support than mine.  
Since I read a lot of comments saying that France has to kick out all Muslims, that there generally never will be peace between the western world and Muslims etc. I want to say this:

I have lived and worked in the Middle East, mostly Qatar but also Saudi and Dubai and currently in Oman, for a couple of years and am sitting right now in a cafe in Muscat having breakfast: multiple Omanis have come up to my table and offered their sympathy and condolences, saying they'd pray for the victims and makeing it very clear how shocked, angry and just pissed of they are, that asshats like those in Paris give a bad name for the hundreds of millions of peaceful Muslims who just want to live their lives as everybody else.

I am very aware of the many problems in the Middle East but there is a lot of change going on and on the other hand there is no nation or religion that does not have shortcomings and instead of pointing fingers and blaming those who are as appalled and shocked as we are, we should stand united against those who are trying to ruin it for everybody!

Let us be shocked, let us be sad, let us mourn but don't let them change us. Don't let fear get the better of us and our values, don't give in to hate, that is the only we can lose.

I'm German and I couldn't be prouder that Germany is taking in millions of refugees right know and I only hope that, besides those few clowns who think that helping others in need is dangerous for us (fucking nazis, so embarassing), we continue to help those who need it most, be it in Germany or abroad.

so how many more attacks will it take for people to stop defending this bullshit ideology. this shit needs to stop. Vive la France.

As i lay down my head i think of all those people who died tonight in Paris how there day started normal and now have there life ended shortly and this i am sad but also graceful that i am alive and breathing life is preciousness enjoy it as much as you can for it is far to easy to be taken away The world stands with you tonight France
 
Look sorry for being offensive or whatever but honestly fuck Islam. Fuck all religions. People are killing other people over fairy tale bullshit because they're idiots. None of its real. Why should I have to tolerate and act like its normal for people to believe such insane shit. All it does is turn people against each other. Religion is fucking poison and it has no place in this world 
What happened is abhorrent. But remember that they WANT us to hate them, they WANT us to discriminate all Muslims. Instead let's help eachother. 
There is something I haven't been able to shake since news started coming out: the fact that they attacked a Cambodian restaurant. Of course every single one of these deaths is abhorrent and the victims were all the same in the eyes of the attackers, but this one is really sticking with me. I can't help but think about how this was a business that was likely run by immigrants, immigrants from a country that was also messed up by French colonialism. And yet here they are, living peacefully, moving forward, perhaps even struggling as many immigrants do. They might have even been refugees at one point. 

Before the inevitable flood of xenophobia sets it (although, it is already here), let's not forget that France is a diverse place and that even immigrants suffer in these tragedies (and in the aftermath, when the backlash occurs). 
As I was checking the updates of the Paris attacks on my phone while judging a high school debate tournament two things ran through my mind, fear and rage. Fear for the safety of my Parisian family and friends, and rage towards humans who have somehow justified this method as a means of normal resolutions to our world's problems. As I absorbed the instant reaction of rage, vengeance, justice, and retribution, I looked up and around to see hundreds of teenagers pushing each other to the brink of logical and philosophical discussion over how their generation would fix these crises for the good of every side. It is in this moment I found my anger dissipating and faith in humanity returning. This is when we must look to how we educate a future if we desire that future to not have a group shooting up the streets of Paris during concerts and soccer games. Seek to bring compassion to the root of the problem so the problem does not desire to come to you. The next generation wants to learn how to run this planet, go to a high school debate tournament if you don't believe me. But how they run it will be up to how we educate in regard to circumstances such as today. Choose wisely. Thoughts of love with all of France, liberte egalite fraternite.
Lack of economic opportunities, institutionalized racism, segregation, and marginalization are clearly the root cause of the problem here.  In order to prevent more young Muslims from being 'radicalized' we need to open up the borders even more, build public housing for low income residents in more affluent regions in Europe to encourage integration, give out monthly government benefits so that migrants can have a livable income, offer services in Arabic, and also mandate that schools in Europe teach in Arabic.  Maybe then everyone will get along in a multicultural environment.


Yeah, how about a big middle finger to all of that.  
I am just so fucking over this. This just keeps on happening. Every single time a mass terrorist attack occurs it's always these radical Islamists and jihadist. I'm just over it. It *keeps* on happening. I can't keep saying to myself 'not all terrorists are Muslims' or that 'it's just a small minority' because this just *keeps on happening* 
http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34495161

it happend in turkey,in our capital just a month ago.What did you do for that?
Nothing right?
Because it was turkey far away from you

isis is a problem syrians is a problem and europeans should react that earlier.

sorry for victims and their familys

What the fuck....  How can people just go and kill other people like this? 
It's going to be worse every year because of immigration from Middle East.
if there is a positive to take, despite how terrible this incident is, it's that the world is united against ISIS: regardless of politics or geography, even russia and the US can put tensions aside and agree that ISIS needs to be dealt with.  no matter what your background, or what language you speak, I think we can all agree that the time to get rid of these assholes is now.

lets wipe these motherfuckers out, together.
As fucked up as it is, there's only one solution to all of this.

The knee jerk reaction I hear people say is to just wipe them out... bomb them, nuke the middle east into glass, ect.

But that just makes more of them in a few years. The only way to deal with this is to stabilize the countries they come from, and educate the younger generations out of this. 
Lebanon Yesterday, Iraq too and now France

What the fuck is happening in the world
Its horrifying to think that these terrorists started shooting like it was nothing. It seems like they saw it as a normal job. Just incomprehensible.
The whole thing is a massive shock to everyone, but still there were people actively pushing their bullshit agendas at the expense of the victims. Absolutely disgusting.
My wife and I were due in Paris this week on our honeymoon but she was too ill to go. So lucky. Feel numb right now.
Today, we are all French. Our hearts are with you from all around the world.
ISIS claims responsibility
the "revised down to" tag is probably one of the few bits of good news I've seen in the last 24 hours. Its so very rare that death toll's come down, we usually only see them climb.
fuck isis
My deeply condolencies to the family of the victims in France and Lebanon in general, this is horrible and coward.
 
Piece of shit cowards killing defenseless people. Thoughts go out to all the friends and family affected by this. 
There can never be peace when every breath ISIS members take goes toward their efforts against the world.

Those animals deserve death and worse.
Coming from a country that has made all of the worst mistakes after a terrorist attack, I sincerely hope France doesn't compromise itself after this event.
Paris attack is an attack on entire humanity. Fundamentalism of all kinds is the worst enemy of society. Let us pray for residents of Paris.
I went to sleep crying knowing there were 35 casualties, woke up to 158 deads. I just don't know... The horror they must have felt... I'm feeling so helpless, once again this year... Be brave my fellow french, I am sorry for all your losses and all my thoughts are with you
I have been suspicious of the "refugee" mass exodus of fighting-age males for awhile now.  It would be easily exploitable by Islamic extremists.  The West needs to begin to get over political correctness and protect their own.  

How do we fight indoctrination and brainwashing? **In my view, by realizing and accepting that many people are not from a culture where independent thinking is learned or valued.**  It's ridiculously obvious. We must provide that framework and structure for those who need it.  We indoctrinate those who need it. Nationalism.  Pride in being a citizen of your country.  And that takes time.  Tossing open your gates without using skilled gatekeepers who ask questions, poke, prod and assess the potential immigrants is a mistake.  All this nonsense about putting the nondominant culture on a pedestal needs to stop.  Why do immigrants want to come to a new country? Is it because it's better than where they're from? Usually, yes.  So adopt the new way of life.  It is part of the deal.  Hell, assign a cultural education force to these immigrants.  Quarantine them in a camp until they pass a rigorous, nonstandardized assessment and are ready for the privilege of being a citizen.

We're great. Embrace the greatness.  We've built great societies.  We deserve to have some pride in who we are.
Obama needs to get over his gripe with Assad. He's an asshole, but he isn't killing us. ISIS is. 
I noticed myself getting angry at the idea of muslims and islams and read some comment on Reddit saying that is exactly what they are trying to do. Get westerners to isolate muslims more so more of them join the likes of IS. I am ashamed of how I felt.

As obvious as it is, I think we should constantly not forget that this is the action of idiots - not Muslims and make sure we dont isolate them.

Also, I cannot imagine how much pain the survivors of the concert or anyone witnessing the carnage would have felt but also, how much they will feel in the future. They will suffer a lot with many developing serious and long lasting PTSD.

The people of the United States are with you France.
Will Charile Hebdo be doing a funny magazine cover on this, like it did about the Russian plane being blown up?
The bodies aren't even cold and there are already people proclaiming the innocence of Islam, and some even saying the west is at fault. Holy fuck some people will go to any lengths to stop their worldview being shattered.
[deleted]
Je suis France. Saddened. You just don't kill people...simple as that. =( Why harm others that never harmed you...
I hope europe finally closes its borders. Enough with the refugees, governments need to protect their own people. 
Fuck these fucking extremists
It would be wrong to say this is why I am anti islam so I wont, I will say this is why i'm an anti theist, all religion has this potential none are exempt from fostering blind illogical extremists, they are all cancer and serve no purpose in modern society and do more harm than good. As long as people continue to believe in fairy tales more than they believe in their own lives and the lives of those around them, this violence will never stop, that is why I am sad. My heart goes out to the families of those who lost someone today, no one should have to go through this.
I think a lot of people are overlooking poverty's role in terrorism.  Radical religions always use the poorest and most undereducated fools they can find to do the slaughter. The ones who are desperate, who have little to live for anyway, and are sometimes just doing it because someone agreed to provide for their family after.
Noooo :(
I don't think people realize how hard this makes fitting into western society as a fellow Muslim and it feels like its only going to get worse.

I work my ass of to make a good impression on my fellow neighbors, and those who gave me the privilege to live on the same soil.

However, I get this horrible gut feeling that I am sub-consciously being judged after an event like this.

I fucking hate it, and at this point, I honestly don't know what to do. These idiots cant fix their shit on their own homeland, so they move... to fuck everyone else up.

I guess all I can do is donate to any foundations to help those families who lost someone dear to them.

Fuck my people, fuck my religion, just... fuck 
just one hour of attacks in paris to understand why families embark on boats to flee their country.
These attacks are a tragedy. My thoughts are with the families with loved ones that won't make it home tonight. Makes me feel forever grateful for the life I have in North America.
Radical Islam is truly terrifying. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone effected. What a sad night in a great city. When will we realize there is something fundamentally wrong with Islam? Today's radicals are ruthless and I only hope we can work together with all countries that strive for peace and prosperity to destroy these monsters. It is truly painful to watch the news from America and see what is happening in France. RIP to all the deceased. 
Just woke up and found out about this. I'm just so furious and I don't know how to react.

My heart goes out to Paris, France and everyone affected by these horrible attacks. 
It took a couple of hours but I just heard it first on CNN: a US "expert" suggesting that European gun control laws are to blame because "only the criminals" have access to guns.
the death toll of terrorists around the world is about to skyrocket. the world is more ready to annihilate this worthless scum than ever before. 
What exactly happened at the stadium? 
Will Charlie Hebro make similar release as did with russian plane?
Where is a good place to donate? I tried french red cross but it was complicated.
So, what is it? 158 or 128? I keep hearing conflicting reports.
Why are people so sanguine about this having nothing to do with Islam? Perhaps you've noticed there are some pretty depraved passages in the Koran. And yet civil society seems intent not to challenge Muslims on their holy scripture. People seem to suppose this tac is somehow progressive, or pluralist, or inclusive. But to me it seems an incredibly cynical approach. Firstly, it evokes an atmosphere of lowered expectations for brown-skinned Muslims who should just be left to their superstitions and primitive beliefs. They don't know any better, and after all, who am I to judge?  --Except of course in cases involving evolution deniers, or "pray the gay away" counselors, or foes of gay marriage, or supposedly racist conservatives and teabaggers. Yes, *their* abhorrent views must be challenged and dismantled. Their literature is rightly subject to ridicule and scrutiny. They should know better. But the bigotry towards women, freethinkers, and homosexuals perpetrated as a direct result of Koranic inducements-- well, I can't very well say what I think about that. After all, what else do those poor Muslims have but that book? In fact, it might be nice of me to defend it on their behalf. No, I wouldn't dream of actually reading it myself but it warms the cockles of my heart to know I care.
  
String me up as a racist for broaching the issue. The word has lost some of the opprobrium it once held after so many false and manipulative applications of the term. This is only a parody of my view of the postmodern guilt-ridden, latently racist liberal mind. But where there is a hint of truth in what I say, it does explain some of the drivel that passes for tolerance in our day.
This shit is tiring.

Sorry, but we need to sever all ties with the middle east. No more oil, no more refugees, no more immigrants, no more aid, no more anything. Fucking blockade the entire thing. No one in, no one out. Until they can grow the fuck up and act like a civilized part of the world, they can be locked in their fucking room. Enough of the apologies, enough of these idiotic attacks. We can't be the ones cleaning up their shit. The muslims have to do it themselves. Anything we do will just breed more hatred.

You can't reason with people hellbent on destruction. 
Who else thinks Charlie Hedbo is going to be complete hypocrites, making fun of the Russians tragedy is ok, but they'll leave this one out of it. Fuck those guys. I am pre-emptively calling the hypocrisy to come.
So....these guys have attacked a country who:

1. anthem says "we will water our fields with your blood" 

2. Has the world's best military record.

3. Literally. The anthem is basically "we will kill and destroy everything you hold dear if you fuck with us"

4. Has crazy good special forces. 

5. Doesn't pull punches. Ever. and has big ass friends



Seriously. They fucked with the wrrooooooong country. You don't fuck with France. 


I mean fuck what's next for these chumps? Attacking Russia? Who will just go *fuck et. Nerve gas the whole lot of em.* or use a god damn apc main gun on a sky scraper held by a few rebels? https://youtu.be/fY2B1Bpo1dY


Seriously. What worse decision making abilities could you have then to attack FRANCE. Fuckin hell. 
Did everyone forget about Beirut aswell...
My heart goes out to all who were lost in this atrocious crime 
as a muslim i sincerely apologize for this disgusting crime done by mentally retarded people following their now sick ways.

I can't believe so many redditors are still defending Islam. Hasn't this gotten out of hand at this point? redditors have no trouble saying we need more gun control..but the idea of "islam control" oh no! how intolerant. 
It is naive for governments to think they can integrate all cultures. Some cultures are toxic to others. Social engineering needs to take this into account. Stop believing everybody will just get along, and hold hands under a rainbow. Stop letting psychotic individuals through your borders.
As an American, I feel we should go all pre-WW1 isolationism for a decade or so.  Let's let this bullshit play itself out.  Maybe the world will be better off without us trying to "fix" everything.  If it's better, great... If it's worse, then we can at least nobody can blame us.  The middle east needs to work out this tribal bullshit before it can possibly join the rest of the world.  Form your caliphate, get recognized as a country by NATO or UN, formally declare war on the west, get destroyed when you push it and finally see what "all out war" really is.  I really think it's going to get a lot worse, and needs to, before it gets better.  
I think it's time to take a hard look at the ISIS supporters in the 'international community'. This means the house of Saud. There should be no mercy for collaborators. Money should not protect those people, enough is enough. Same goes for Turkey, there should be a clear line, to support these barbarians means you are declaring war on the civilized world. 
I still remember the incident where  132 children 168 total where killed by Taliban in Pakistan in 2014. Loss of life cannot be really compared objectively, but man that affected me. How do you fight that kind of hate?
I know it sounds alarmist, but I can't help but be scared that this sort of thing becomes commonplace in the West. I'm anxious at this moment.


Syrian passport.  Wow Who would have thought /s
The disturbing thing is, there is a very conscious decision of funding and creating these terrorist groups by sane, powerful and rich people, only to be richer and more powerful... It saddens me to see how people neglect the real source of terrorism. This is not a hollywood movie where some crazy villain gets all the weapons and sources he needs on his own. If these guys came this far, it is because governments and strong politicans funded and allowed them to take these actions...
The first to do now is find everybody who's been involved in or lending any help and assistance to these guys, locked them up and question them. I don't care who, their families, friends, coworkers, their mosques buddies, their inmans, their bosses. They knew something, and sitting by letting it happen. You can't have that kind of coordination of attacks without some serious direct help and planning. 


I wish CNN would talk about that instead of showing footage of people laying flowers for the deads, they don't want your fucking flowers, they want justice. 
Europe needs to retaliate. And it WILL happen.
The Islam apologism is already flowing freely.

I look forward to all the excuses, pleas to emotion, and crybullying there will be all over reddit to try and get people to turn their head and pretend Islam isn't a problem.

Why, we've already got people in here comparing it to Christianity. Nevermind that the events they compare happened centuries ago, that's nbd, still totally relatable!
If Muslims thought they had a hard time before....
"'Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion." - Steven Weinberg
I barely slept last night because of the events that took place in Paris. I was only able to think of the people that were killed last night. I wondered what was going through their minds those moments, knowing that guns are pointed at you and in every moment you could feel a sharp pain and that's it. We're they able to say goodbye to their family? Did all happened really fast? Ah, it makes me sick. I will have nightmares about this.
Refugees welcome!
Islam is a cancerous religion.
Oh yay, more war to come. Another tragedy that will now instigate more conflict. Another tragedy that just seems to help the government manipulate their agenda. My heart dropped when I heard about this and I mourn everyone that lost their lives but I hate the fact that a peaceful world is so far from the horizon. 
The part that REALLY baffles me is how the fuck couldnt France or any other counter terrorist organization in the world pick up on something like this. The US has one of the best counter intelligence/terrorist organizations in the world and yet this some how slipped under the radar. THAT is what scares me, that these people can fly so low under the radar and pull these attacks off these days. They can get all the weapons and explosives that easily without being detected by the CIA or the French really scares the shit out of me.

Unfortunately, and I say this with a humble concern and worry in my heart, that continued actions such as these will, Inevitably I think, lead to a second holocaust, but with Muslims as the victims. 

Think about how easy it would be these days for a leader of a country to rally around the cause of the "Muslim plague" or some other scary notion, and repeat WWII more or less. :(

Fuck religion.
The sad thing is that many liberals will still defend Islam and spew apologetics and ignorance like they've been doing since 9/11.

When will they wake up and smell the jihad.
Stop importing refugees that support this. That would help.
fuck syria

fuck the refugees

and fuck islam.  that is all.
This is totally unrelated to the immigration crisis at all. We should let in more muslims and africans to Europe you guys, check your privilege. Especially young, fighting age men. Come on, what are you, a racist?
fucking cowards.  they need to be eradicated.  
How the fuck do you massacre over a 100 people at a concert hall? Makes me tear up. Stay strong my french fam. 
How do such young guys get their hands on heavy arsenal and bombs in France outside a warzone? The leaders or masterminds of this horrific attack must be found and dealt with. They are cowards to use young easily manipulated minds to cause terror and pain. 
I'm so pissed right now honestly just imagining in pisses me off

fucking cowards
This is the point of no turning back
"Earlier reports suggested up to 157 people had been killed, before the Bataclan death toll was significantly revised down."
Saudi Arabia, Syria and Iraq for starters
 Possibly more gulf states like Qatar and the UAE if necessary. 
Christ it sounds like a scene from inglorious bastards. Firing from the theater balcony.  
How. How can people think killing people is serving a greater good? How can one kill that many innocent? How can someone pull the trigger to bring such pain to an entire world. Why? Why does such evil exist?
This has been messing with my head a lot more than I thought it would. So much has happened throughout time and with all the things on the internet I began to feel like I was desensitized. Yesterday just proved to me that I was wrong..I feel terrible for all the families and victims that had to go through this BS.
killed by religious nutters in the name of their god ?  
Man the numbers keep goung up and up every time I read about it.

Oh my god.  I can't wrap my head around these types of events.  Those poor people.  Ffs stop fucking killing innocent people!
The FUCK is wrong with this world man

This is horrible. Thoughts and prayers for those who lost their loved ones.  


My thoughts are here with you.  I am in Texas but not religious .. but it is on your country.  If there is some how I could contribute whether by donations or whatever let me know.  
"What Pisses Me Off About The Paris Terrorist Attack" by Stefan Molyneux
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2iBZkODgxA
Can someone post numbers about the perpetrators? How many were caught and were invovled, how many were shot, and how many blew themselves up?
I really hope that people wake up and not forget about this...Because nowadays when something as tragic as what happened today...typically we tend to forget and not fight or do something. I hope I'm saying this right and don't get people angry but that's how I feel about this...My thoughts are with Paris and the victims. **We need to stand up and do something**
Can you please update the title? It's no longer accurate according to the linked article itself.

&gt;At least 120 people have died in Paris in a wave of coordinated gun and suicide bomb attacks, prompting the French president, François Hollande, to declare a state of emergency and tighten controls on the country’s borders.[...] Earlier reports suggested up to 157 people had been killed, before the Bataclan death toll was significantly revised down.
Awful. Condolences to the victims families. 
Where pride is king paranoia reigns supreme 
Random late night, or, early morning delirium, trying to relax my nerves and unwind from a long week of slave labor to pay for the things I need to survive in my insignificant daily life; does anyone think this situation could have been handled differently if, say, even 20 people had a concealed carry firearm on their persons? The reason I'm at this solution at this point is because I've been lying in bed, replaying this scenario in my mind. I don't want to leave my house without a pistol and two loaded clips these days. 
The real problem is ideology. Any set of beliefs: religious, economic, political, can turn any group of passionate people into those that gunned down (like cowards) 158+ people. 

The problem is not inherently Islam or religion, it's mankind's utter weakness of *belief* period. 
I can't believe this happened, what kind of sick individuals think it's acceptable to kill innocent people. It makes me sick to my stomach. 
Hate to say this, but this is just like the scenes from "The Bourne Identity" where you see various sleeper agents going about their normal lives and who are then suddenly and covertly activated to go on kill missions.   There are likely sleeper cells all over Europe and other parts of the world.    I suspect there were way more attackers involved in this Paris tragedy..maybe upwards of 24 - 30.  You'd need lookouts and people who can drive the attackers to their destination and perhaps help them escape if they were able to flee.  You'd need people conducting covert surveillance in the months leading up to the attack and especially on the day of the attack.  That only a few actual attackers are known to have been killed to me means the rest have melted right back into the Paris population and are now in hiding.
This is so so so  sickening to think about. I can't breathe. My condolences. Stay strong! I don't know what to say. From a Muslim. Not a terrorist. :'(
Clash of civilizations.  I think at this point, it's us or them.  That says nothing about how we got here, it's just a sad fact.   
I am all for taking the fight to ISIS (if that was who was behind this) at the same time we need to step back and have a clear achievable objective and know the metrics we are going to judge success by.  
My heart goes out to all french people. A sad day for Europe. And although muslim terrorist are behind this, this is a very very sad day for european muslims. It must be very frustrating sharing faith with such monsters that keep ruining your life.

Charlie Hebdo did not call on any persecution of muslims after their attack. Europe is already full of muslims. We can not solve this problem by escalating the hatred. It is not possible to throw all muslims out of Europe. 

We have to deal with the fact that muslims are here to stay. The only solution is to make muslims strong allies in the fights against extremists.
This is horrible. Can't imagine what those people went through. I hope everyone responsible, directly or otherwise, are brought to swift justice. I hope extremist Muslims are wiped off the face of the earth somehow. They make us moderate peace-loving Muslims look horrible. 
That's such an unsettling clip. Watching it fills me with so many emotions - fear, sadness, anger. I don't know what the right solution to all of this is, but man tonight I'm just sending my thoughts and love to my fellow humans in France. Here's to hoping we can find a way to end all of this.
Wait wasn't a potential mass shooting thwarted, on a train bound for Paris, earlier this year?? France really needs to get on top of this, I'd be terrified to live anywhere near Paris.

edit: [The shooting that I mentioned](http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/21/amsterdam-paris-train-gunman-france)
Are we going to see a cartoon by Charlie Hebdo on this?
This just sickens me to the core to hear. My thoughts are with all the families and friends of those who were needlessly slaughtered, and all the poor innocent people who witnessed this.

R.I.P.
http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3dqzx9_images-de-la-fusillade-au-bataclan_news#tab_embed  A look of what hapenned outside 
It says in the article that it was *thought* to be that high but later revised to around 120.
France, UK, USA, Australia and others should just intensify the bombing in ISIS regions to an unprecedented amount, I'm talking most of their air forces. Better than having to actually invade the god forsaken area. 
Invoke article 5.
So ISIL have presumably given up on trying to be recognised as both politically and religiously legitimate? And are now using indiscriminate means to cause out right chaos? Playing on the weaknesses of the vulnerable youth who will feel the burden of the racial divide, that makes sense on their part.

But surely they realise that, to the international community, this will not help their case of legitimacy?
Thoughts go out to the families, cant imagine what they must be going through right now

Wonder how many Muslims they killed without knowing if you shoot like you can't really discriminate 
Oklahoman here. Approaching OKC bombing's 168-victim count has me even more sobered to the loss Paris and the whole of France will feel to all these victims. Some amazing stories of lives well lived will be heard in coming weeks. 
Oh fuck
Lot of alert for a new attack in Bagnolet, turns out it's just Idiots lighting fireworks a few minutes ago for a wedding... 
It's been 25 years and all only keeps on getting worse.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigipirate

Some say they won't stop there. As a french person who has grown with the omnipresent threat of islamist terrorism, I can only agree.
I'm an Aussie living in Japan that knows where to buy whale.

The shop's in the middle of town with big pictures of whales on the outside. Not discrete at all.
these worldnews headliners with their wrestling lingo "so and such got SLAMED" whoaaaahhhh lookout for the "ultra-omega slamerino, but here comes the COUNTRIES ELBOW" ...
The IUCN Red List labels the common minke whale as Least Concern. The Antarctic minke whale is listed as Data Deficient.

COSEWIC puts both species in the Not At Risk category. NatureServe lists them as G5 which means the species is secure on global range.

In 2012, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission agreed upon a population estimate of 515,000 for the Antarctic minke stock. The Scientific Committee acknowledged that this estimate is subject to a negative bias because some minke whales would have been outside the surveyable ice edge boundaries.
The irony of Australia criticising Japan for ignoring scientific advice given that is exactly what Australia is doing in relation to climate change. 
"This year on whale wars..."
I admire Japan for many things, however its insistance on whaling is difficult to fathom.
I'm going to get down voted to hell for this, but Minke whales are not endangered or threatened. I have more issue with wild-caught fish than I do with Minke whale
&gt;Tokyo cannot "unilaterally decide" to ignore scientific advice, &amp; international court of justice ruling, to hunt &amp; kill 333 minke whales.

[Apparently Japan can, since they did.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/99/c9/5b/99c95bb590730a03996fc03682af05ac.jpg)
Honestly, I think it's a little fucked up that Japan is always singled out for their whaling. Scandinavian countries do it too, but I have never heard anyone go off on Norway or Finland for whaling. 

As long as they're only taking minke whales and not endangered whales I don't really have a problem with it. I don't get it, whale doesn't taste very nice, but hey, if there's a market for it, then I guess go ahead and meet that demand.
Minke whale are not a threatened species. In fact, you can order them off any number of menus in Iceland - Not that tasty though. I suppose if the scientific advice referred to here is that they're not worth eating, I would agree.
I think Australia shouldn't participate in live cattle and sheep exports to the middle east which are shown to be extremely cruel and difficult for the animals involved. Shark culls Australia participates in are also something it shouldn't do, but sharks aren't cute and sympathetic are they? The continued bleaching of the largest living organism on the planet - the Great Barrier Reef through bad farming practices, climate change (of which Australia has denied and resisted mitigating for the longest time) is a shame too, not to mention the 10 mammal species, 4 bird species, 13 fish species, 7 reptile species, 15 amphibian species, and 37 arthropod species over there that at this very moment are critically endangered largely due to habitat loss, environmental policy, climate change, feral predation or other mismanagement. Australia isn't in a position to lecture Japan about this.
'Slams'
Minke whales are at least concern status... Where does this outrage come from and why does Japan feel the brunt of it while Norway continues unabated?

http://www.ifaw.org/united-states/our-work/whales/which-countries-are-still-whaling

The whole thing seems like impotent outrage as somebody on the outside of it. These whales aren't threatened. 
Whaling is one of those rare things that will disappear sooner if it's ignored rather than being banned. And I don't mean that it will end because all whales will be killed. It will end because there's very little of it already, and the demand is rapidly shrinking. Cow tastes a lot better than whale. 

Much of the reason whaling is still going on is pure stubbornness from a tiny number of whalers, who are backed up by politicians wanting to mint some political coin on not doing what foreigners tells them to. Those old whalers are just doing what they always have done, and all they know how to do, in Japan, Norway and among natives in a few other countries, including the USA, Canada and Greenland. Pretty much everywhere, the next generation is looking elsewhere than towards a career as whalers.
So lemme guess, the hivemind that wails and gnashes teeth over TTIP and the destruction. Of sovereignty is all for stomping on Japan's sovereignty here
I dont see the harm of whaling as long as its regulated to some degree to protect population sizes. 
Australians can enjoy kangaroo burgers but they wanna prevent Japanese from enjoying fine whale sushi? Come on.
They should really crack down on Russia and China taking shrimp from antartica first. Big Mammals make people feel bad but their food being depleted will cause a lot more problems to the ecosystem than the whales.
I once learned that the whole industry is only kept alive by the goverment. Even japanese people dont want to nix whale flesh. 
All I want is for Japan's leaders to publicly announce:

"We don't give a fuck"
Australia pointing the finger at other countries, with its moral superiority? Sorry, you lost that when you voted Abbott in.
The minke whale has a population of over half a million as of 2012, so is hunting 333 of them really going to devastate the species?  Or is the argument that hunting any whales for any reason is wrong?  Their conservation status is currently least concern from the IUCN.

edit:  I listed the data for the Northern Minke Whale, which is different than the Antarctic Minke whale.  The population for the Antarctic variety is data deficient.  My bad.
Why can't Japan unilaterally decide to ignore scientific advice?  Isn't that what the GOP in the US are doing about global warming, and what Australia's current government is doing about global warming?

Hell's bells, Saudi Arabia unilaterally decides to still put people to death for "witchcraft" and "being atheist" despite there's no scientific evidence to show that witchcraft is real or that atheists are bad people, they use their voodoo ("Islam") to justify their stupidity (like ISIS does).  The GOP in the US just substitutes their own voodoo ("Christianity") and achieves much of the same thing.
There are hundreds of thousands of Antarctic minke whales. There are far bigger ecological problems to address internationally, and this save the minke whales shit is just a stupid distraction. 
&gt; Environment minister says Tokyo cannot "unilaterally decide" to ignore scientific advice

As a sovereign nation, they can unilaterally decide to do whatever they fuck they want. If you're not happy, do something about it champ.
Who cares? Minke whales are not endangered, they are a pest, any salt water harbor in the world has a tone of these whales. It's not like they are hunting Humpback or Blue whales. This is the equivalent of banning the killing of regular grey squirrels because flying squirrel are endangered. They are entirely different species. 
Too bad your country doesn't get to dictate all the other countries. You go, Japan!

If I get to eat hamburger, they can eat whale all they want. Fuck you and your 'but it's cute!' shit.

I've always wanted to know what whale tastes like.
The International court of justice has no authority, japan can do whatever it wants. They aren't endangered so unless you're arguing whales are somehow different in development or intelligence than the millions of pigs that are eaten there really is nothing wrong with it. 
Putting aside context, say someone is not "allowed" to ignore "advice" sets a dangerous mentality.
Isn't culling of minke beneficial for other, more endangered species of whales?

If you're not happy, do something about it when you see the hypocrisy of the oceans.
Looks like Australia is learning fighting moves from the UN.
Doesn't Australia want a large part of the ocean near Antarctica to be recognized as theirs? 
You know what else? Nothing will be done either. No other country is willing to stand up to an economic powerhouse like Japan so they are allowed to do whatever, just like the US and every other powerhouse. The rules only apply to those who might take coin away from the big guys.
Asia, sucking the planet dry
I mean, if whales are about as intelligent as pigs and we farm pigs, whats the difference?
Aren't they the same ones who ignore crimes committed against Aboriginal people?
 
I'm pretty sure no one has to take anyone's advice, even "scientific advice"
This seems like a difference in culture, and people are way too passionate about whales. If they were calling for them to stop eating octopus no one would care. Also why is it alright for western people to eat pig when they are as smart as dogs?
The sad part is that, yes.. they can ignore advice. They have done if for years. And they will continue to do it until there is some sort of enforcement (not saying right or wrong) or until there are no whales left to hunt. 
The TPP says they can do it.  Fuck your morality.
As long as the whales are not endangered and the population is well controlled, I don't see the problem with it.
Apparently Japan can, since they cry it is from your description It's not.
Is this just a cultural thing or what's the deal? Japan seems to give zero fucks when it comes to whaling and the environment. That shit would not be cool here across the ocean.  You place a whale meat sign outside your business? You're going to get protested. 

Did you want to get protested? 

Because that's how you get protested. 

Yet Japan.... Fuck it. Kill more. 
The fact that they just won't stop doing it - shows you how much money is involved.
As laughably bad as Japan's lie about the purpose of the hunts is, is there an objective reason to disallow them? If not then this is the same as countries that eat dog and having no objection to eating other animals. In this case though, it would be more akin to hunting and not eating animals.
Could someone explain why Minke whaling is so frowned upon, when according to Wikipedia, minke whales are "least concern" while bluefin tuna is "endangered"? 
Weren't the Aussies going to dredge a massive coral reef a while back? How's that coming along...
Japan has a right to whale meat.
Fishing 100-200 whales a year is not going to make a fuck of a difference compared to the mass scale fishing of other fish.
A fuck you whale andd a fuckk you dolphin!!!
The population of the antarctic Minke whale is "clearly in the hundreds of thousands", so I'm done giving a shit about hunting this species. We need to direct this energy towards habitat conservation, fisheries protecting, and climate change. NOT protecting a charismatic species that is not threatened by hunting.
Whale meat is pretty special though. It taste like tuna when raw, but beef when cooked.
"...They cannot..." should really be "they shouldn't" because they're clearly showing they can. 
I've never understood the problem. To be so outraged. South Korean's eat dogs. Where is the Greenpeace PETA activists "slamming" them? It's cultural. We eat many types of fish and squid and all sorts of other things. Why do the whales get a special pass not afforded to other creatures of the sea? We in the Western world boil animals alive for fuck sake.They eat wild cats in parts of Australia. Where's the Reddit hate for that?
Australia can be disapproving of this, but actually it kind of is Japan's unilateral decision. I don't agree with it, but good luck.
They can if they want. 
I don't get it when everyone is going up in arms when someone decides to hunt minke whale. It's not in threat of going extinct, so why is it such a big deal? Because they are the beautiful, gentle giants of the ocean?

But then again I'm Icelandic and whale is one of my favorite foods.
&gt;“Australia will continue to pursue the issue through the International Whaling Commission"

The IWC is a joke. Hijacked by non-whaling countries in order to ban whaling, completely ignoring that these whales are not threatened in any way or form.

It's like if the brewing association of america was hijacked by religious extremists who wanted to ban alcohol.

Hey Australia, up here in Norway we have a quota for 1300 minke whales this year. That's right, 3-4 times the amount of Japan. What are you going to do about that? Talk smack to us as well? Threaten us with your little joke organization perhaps?

Thought not.. fucking hypocrites..
Who are Australia to lecture anyone on environmental issues. Come back when you stop denying climate change.
Australia is such a backwards and hypocritical country, we arent anything special yet we still think we're top shit because the media feeds us that information. Basically America 2.0 now
We are destroying the ocean enough already. Let's just ban whaling.
Interesting the way Australia freaks out about the whaling industry when it's wool industry is horrific for the sheep.
Actually, they can
Pffft.  Australian government pays lip service to conservation but encourages coal mining and pays lip service to human rights but puts refugees in concentration camps.  Hypocritical posturing.  Same as every other government.
Somebody please explain to me what their big fucking fascination with whales is. Is it like the Chinese and endangered mammals? Do they think whale parts make their dicks bigger or something? 
ITT Whale meat salesmen?
1. Australia's Antarctic claims are only recognized by four other states with Antarctic claims, NZ, Norway, France, and the UK. Big fucking whoop.

2. Minke, the vast vast vast majority of Japan's catch since the 80's, is completely un-fucking-endangered and the hunt is in no way big enough to affect Minke populations.

3. As the ICJ is completely voluntary Japan can do whatever the fuck it wants.

4. Idiot hippy tears taste delicious.
This again, I'm to lazy to find the actual paper, but research has shown that the large number of minke whales actually inhibits the population of other kinds of whales. Whales that actually are threatened.

Edit: Also, most likely this is Australian politician fishing for those sweet brownie points. Easily caught when talking about whaling.
let's look for something that makes the anglosphere feel better about themselves
A bit rich when you consider the way our government unilaterally decides to do whatever the fuck it wants.  
Can someone ELI5 why whaling is taboo while fishing is fine? Are the whales endangered?
I hope Japan's back didn't get injured after being slammed. 
Japan needs whaling to boost its economy. Its part of the culture. Although I think they should like try and calculate how many they should hunt so that the juicy juicy whales dont end up extinct.
This is a relevant link http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&amp;p2=3&amp;k=64&amp;case=148&amp;code=aj&amp;p3=0
australia should just send a fleet to keep whaling ships out of *their* waters then... oh, wait.
Japan can't decide to ignore scientific advice? Righto. How do you feel about climate change, mate?
What is the enforceability of this international court ruling? Is it binding or just a policy agreement? 

[deleted]
I'm confused by the title.  Was the ruling to hunt 333 wales?
hippocoalastic! 
Is that glorious fucktard Tony Abbott still top dog in Kangaroo Land?
THE WORLD IS A VAMPIRE
Then do something about it. Its not like Australia has a tiny navy.
Pretty sure they can.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=E39WWj_RpBc   What hes really saying
I despise whaling, but last time I checked, we didn't have a one world government...nor should we. 
[Slam](http://imgur.com/yxkFNJ2.jpg)
All he has done nothing!
Human beings, fascinating creatures... *murderers*
Japan can unilaterally decide unless Australia decides to go to war with  Japan...and wins said war.
It's as if you treat the population the same with the Australian position.
  Fuck you dorphins and whares!!!!
But they can, though.
Fakku yoo whai-roo!
I may (or may not) agree with what Japan is doing in this case; I don't know anything about the minke whale. But I have to ask this: since when is it illegal for a country to act without the permission of the rest of the world? Since when is unilateral action such a terrible thing that no country can do it?
All this free publicity is making people in Japan consume more whale.
Whale meat s delicious. We just need to domesticate them if people want to keep eating them. Look at beef and chicken, if they become a big enough staple they'll never go extinct. Humanity tends to overpopulated and keep delicious foods alive. 
In fact, you can get it when everyone is going up in arms when someone decides to hunt in their culture.
Fahka yoo Wheyle!!!!
Does this mean Whale wars got renewed?
&gt;cannot unilaterally decide

Well, sounds like they just did.
International courts are a joke. There is no way to enforce the rulings.
Stupid question but cant you just declare the whales citizens of your country? Then any attack against them will provoke sanctions or other consequences?
If they were serious about this, they'd just have one of their submarines follow each of the whaling ships playing loud sounds to drive away the whales. Label it "A scientific study on the impact of loud noise on marine life." What they gonna do, it's international waters.
Yay!  We're taking a stance on an environmental and social issue.  Of course, it would be a lot easier to take us seriously and not consider us hypocrites if we weren't about to dump a heap of crap on top of the Great Barrier Reef, or locked up refugees indefinitely.
Well since they're going to do it, apparently they CAN "unilaterally decide" to ignore scientific advice &amp; international court of justice ruling to hunt &amp; kill 333 minke whales.
Slaaaaaaaam. Australia slaaaaaams Japan!! Slammmmmm
All that's coming through my head as I read this is that South Park episode... 
Mininuke whales?
Does this mean I can ignore laws as well?
I don't want to hunt whales tho. I want to hunt Japanese whalers. 
1. Australia's Antarctic claims are only recognized by four other states with Antarctic claims, NZ, Norway, France, and the UK. Big fucking whoop.

2. Minke, the vast vast vast majority of Japan's catch since the 80's, is completely un-fucking-endangered and the hunt is in no way big enough to affect Minke populations.

3. As the ICJ is completely voluntary Japan can do whatever the fuck it wants.

4. Idiot hippy tears taste delicious.
Japanese here. I firstly know we resume whaling again. this news isnt big in Japan. thank you reddit.

I personally oppose whaling but have complex feelings. At first, we dont want to get other countries direction. We are not a kid.  Hunting wild life for food is fundamental right for human beings. right? And minke whales are not endangered. And antactic sea doesnt belong to anyone. what right does australia and NZ people for opposing  hunting in public sea?  

Seashepard is worst. They are true terrorist. period. If you support them you cant blame Alqaeda and ISIS. because they all just defended thier belief by violence. 

anyway, whale cuisine culture is for old age. Japan is now aging society and youth opinion doesnt reflect to government. so for 20~30 years old men dies we will stop whaling. 

(Japan is now 2AM midnight. I'm typing it in my futon bed. so dont blame broken english and terrible grammer.)




But whale tastes so dang good. Eh, as long as the whales aren't completely endangered I don't see a problem, and seeing as there are hundreds of thousands of minke whales it doesn't seem like they're too badly off.

You can downvote me all you want, I know you're just jealous because you don't know how good whale is.
actually, it can; fuck you Australia
SLAMS. THEY SLAMMED 'EM.
Beware Australia ! Japan is not pacifist anymore.
People do have to eat, I can understand that its wrong if its just pure sport and killing just to kill, but Japan heavenly uses fish and whale to live off of for food. Telling them not to hunt is like telling them to stop eating.  
No matter how keen people are to munch a whale's meat - they got no damn right to ignore the international court ruling. Scientifically correct or not, there's definitely are legit reason behind it, and the  japanese fisheries must respect that.
Australia, simply send naval patrol ships out, make it clear to Japan that any whalers found will be boarded, the crew arrested and the ship sunk.

(One can dream, since such action would cause an international incident, but whaling makes me fucking angry since there's no need for it.)


Anytime I hear about these animals being hunted like whales, rhino, elephants I always think about that line from Star Trek.  "To hunt a species to extinction is not logical."

That is as simple as it gets.  No need to elaborate any further.  So why is that so hard to grasp?
Considering they overwhelming catch completely unendangered Minke, why is it from the environment minister no less The irony of Australia at large, but we need to direct this energy towards habitat conservation, fisheries protecting, and climate change.
I think he can unless someone decides to place warships on patrol to keep his whalers away. The ocean is pretty much no mans land. 
They can and they will, unless someone does something to stop them.
Tokyo can and it just has.
In case anyone is wondering whale tastes fantastic. It's awesome on the bbq in summer! Also I eat (and live in Norway) so the whale we get is not from endangered species.
Consider yourself SLAMMED, Japan! That'll definitely stop you for good. 

Whales, you're welcome.
just sink some of these whale ships. they'll cry first and then stop.
Honestly I say we sink the damn ships,  have rescue crews on hand and ship every last one of them back to japan
Just looked up that Minke whales aren't endangered, so who fucking cares? Whats up Australia butt?
But, but, they're only doing "scientific research". 

Why waste the whale carcass after the "scientific research" is completed?    :/
Think its time to cull the number of whaling vessels clogging up the Southern Whale preserve. Go get 'em Australia.
Ahem.  


PHUUUUCK you Dolphin and whaaaaleee!!

Is it possible to hang editors and journalists with their urethra when they use these trigger words in headlines--slams, eyes, etc.?
Australia... Australia slams.. Japan because they resume to kill whales.. Australia who says 'fuck you' to the environment since close to a few decades, god the Irony.
They can and they will ignore international warnings 
Japan would have banned whaling 3 decades ago if it weren’t for the Western Greenpeace idiots and their anti whaling campaign.
Dear Australia, 
Fuck off. 
Love, 
Japan 
There are half a million minke whales, eating 333 of them won't make a dent. Whales are tasty
Well Unesco unilaterally decided to register Nanking without telling nor consulting Japan, and nobody raised his voice to say it's not the way you do things. So now don't be surprised if Japan considers they don't have to consult anyone to make their decisions.
Just sink them when they are in international waters.
Cunts 
I hope this absolutely damages Japan's change of getting that $35 Billion dollar submarine contract from Australia. I will always love that country, but it's time the world gets up and completely walks away from Japan's bench. They think it's so cute to isolate themselves from everyone? They expect the get big infrastructure contracts and do huge business deals with other countries like the old ways? 

That's not going to work. 
Japan took all last year off from whaling, mandates a reduction in future kills by 66% and the whale lovers are still pissed!
Meanwhile the US allows the slaughter of 70+ whales every year in their own waters and...................?  Silence!     
Someone should start research on Japanese whalers, by harpooning them.
I don't care if they're not endangered, I fucking love whales, leave 'em alone
FUCK YOU WHALE! FUCK YOU DOLPHIN!
Looks like whale burger &amp; dolphin sushi is back on the menu boys....
The japs can kill all the whales they want.  No skin off my nose. 
Fucka you whale and fucka you dophine!
But whaling is a part of Japan's culture and history. 
Man, whaling? That is just awful.

Fuck, this burger sure is delicious. 
Seriously what is Japan's issue with Wales.  Leave em alone dammit 
Why do countries think they can dictate what other countries do?
&gt; Tokyo cannot "unilaterally decide"

Since when?

These are international waters.  Unless you have international laws and conventions to stop this shit, then fuck off.
Time to sink some whalers.
/r/weeabootales What if I told you the whales they are they are they are clearly not endangered.
You unilaterally decide to register Nanking to Unesco.

They unilaterally decide you can go fuck yourselves with your anti-whaling bullshit.
The Australian Navy should just patrol the area, and blow any whaling vessels out of the water. 
Is whale that tasty?
Time for another donation to Sea Shepherd. :D
FUCK YOU WHARU AND FUCK YOU DORPHIN
Questions is, what will the world do about it?
Every week there's a new article about the horrific ways that Japan treats animals. What's up with them? Why do they have so little respect for animals?
first unit 731 and then comfort women. now this.... 
I know two wrongs don't make a right, I say we find a species of something the Japanese love and over abuse it till near extinction, and when they cry over it, we reword their whale stance to ours. For example cherry blossom trees, you wouldn't want something happening to them now would you???
It would be so cool if some random country, say Russia (because Reddit seems ok with Russia doing the dirty work they're against other countries doing), was violently anti-whaling for whatever reason. Imagine a bunch of Russian submarines hunting whaling ships.
I know I'm whining but, Jesus God, whaling makes no sense.
Was Japan consulted or even *basically told about it* before it was UNILATERALLY decided to register Nanking to UNESCO?

NO.

So now they decided they can unilaterally decide things too.

oooOoOoOO whaaaluu, ME COME FUUUUKAA U UPPP!!!!!
Great Whale wars will be back on TV!  I loved that show.  They picked up some new ships and distracting devices to use against those damm jap whalers too.   Japan will go broke by wasting fuel to just sail around all winter long with no whales to show.

Can't wait to see drones and rc planes dropping cow shit and acid on there ships.  Paintball guns filled with glass marbles and pepper balls, potato shooters shooting acid, harpoons designed to ruin whale meat once the whalers have already made a kill.

Japan has no chance unless they start fireing live ammunition.  Then the real whale wars will start.  There's more then a few people willing to really fight to save our oceans.
I wonder why Japan doesn't start farming whales? Is it just impossible or economically un viable I wonder. That would save the species pretty quickly.
SLAMS. THEY SLAMMED 'EM.
lol "environment minister"
South Africa was changed by pressure from the rest of the world. It's a shame the more wealthy countries aren't put under the same pressures today. The amount of human and animal rights being trashed across the world is too damned high.

Also, fuck the guardian, lefty trash.
That star trek movie, where they go back in time cause they need a whale to save the future. they go back, find out they've been all hunted to extinction. so they go back further in time and wage war against whaling ships. 
Well, when someone tells America to go fuck itself, we get up and do something about it..
Time to nut up, or shut up Australia. 
Japan don't fuck around. If you a fish, u dead motherfucker

these worldnews headliners with their wrestling lingo "so and such got SLAMED" whoaaaahhhh lookout for the "ultra-omega slamerino, but here comes the COUNTRIES ELBOW" ...
I'd say yes to that. As Australia clearly shows that they ignore science on these same areas, there is probably some other agenda behind this than the protection of nature and animals.


Whale wars ftw.
"Slams"? The amount of these minds of headlines now... "So and so gives the perfect response to _______" 
As an Australian, I've always seen this story play out the same way.

Australia - ''Hey Japan, stop killing whales cunt''

Japan - ''LOL''

Australia - ''nah serious mate knock that shit off''

Japan - ''LOLOL''

Australia - ''No joke you cunts this is fucken serious'' 


Japan - ''LOLLOLLOL'''

Australia - ''*sigh* suppose we'll just have to unleash the vegans and their stinky butter again''
Being Japanese and Australian at the same time....fuck both of them.
#SLAMMED!
Yes Japan can, and other countries can respond within the limits of their own legal systems. International law isnt binding, there's no coercive force or power behind it. Its basically blustering.
Let them eat Minke 
Does this mean there will be another season of Whale Wars on Discovery?
Fuck you whale!
[Japan right now](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZokoYsDDoI)
Well, considering Belgium has taken measures based on a 'serious and imminent threat', it could be possible that more attacks are planned for Sunday...Take with a pinch of salt, of course. 
I don't envy people whose actual job it is to evaluate credibility  of threats. With all the fear around right now there are lots of people calling out lots of imaginary scenarios that feel utterly real in their heads. 

And of course you are in deep shit if just one of them was right and you dismissed him/her as the looney that he/she sounded like. 

Edit: spelling
"**The targets listed by Anonymous are as follow:**

"War" has gotten really strange.
This'll likely be more effective than dropping bombs. Isolate where their cash is coming from and they can be starved out. I wish you well and hope you succeed in defeating this evil.



&gt;ISIS has responded to the threat from Anonymous, warning of a reciprocal attack against the activist group

This line made me realize why its good Anonymous is involved. How is ISIS supposed to attack a loose collective of NEETs who never go outside? This is actually an effective counter against them. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold, whoever the hell did that. 

I know Reddit hates thanks for the gold messages, but the difference between the people who hate it and the people who gave me gold is that one spent money on me and one didnt. 
They plan on attacking a WWE event?! I can't think of single place on earth that would have more people hoping for a chance to kill a fucking terrorist. Its like the most American event you can attend 
Edit: Many users have pointed out that NASCAR and gun shows are more American and yes, I realize it isn't a realistic scenario that anyone is gonna fight back or neutralize them, it's a joke lighten up
Fun fact: Sunday is Independence Day in Lebanon.
So the Falcons play at home on Sunday but they are going to hit WWE?  Either NFL security is way too good to beat and they picked a secondary target in Atlanta or this is complete bullshit.  The attacks couldn't possibly be coordinated simultaneous attacks if you hit Atlanta at night and once 4 cities are attacked by ISIS in the same day, I gotta imagine events will start to get cancelled in the United States if there's any small amount of intel that another attack could happen.

From the article:

&gt; when authorities do not take action, Anonymous does. 

I wonder how they can know if/when the authorities have taken action, and if these plans were actually real. Either way, if these were actual planned attacks, this just took an interesting turn. 
For those wanting to know, U.S. Target is WWE survivor series at Phillips arena in Atlanta on Sunday. CNN (based in Atlanta) would have a massive boner. Might turn Anderson straight.
&gt;rawstory.com

it amazes me that people are willing to disbelieve anything reported by the Daily Mail, but people are more than willing to eat up dross from websites like this.
Via Anon twitter 4 minutes ago 

&gt;We did not spread any rumours about possible future ISIS attacks, and frankly, we do not know where the rumours come from.
didn't take ISIS long to figure out the concept of mis-information....
Eagles Of Death Metal.  Five Finger Death Punch.  I wonder if the "Death" part is just a coincidence?   
I'm guessing they've never been to a WWE event in Atlanta. They'll be shot on the street because Atlanta. 
Why Indonesia? 
@YourAnonNews on twitter is now claiming that they were not responsible for the global attack rumors. https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/668156801976836096

Usually, when such info leaks, nothing happens, because the local authorities probably have been aware of it for some time. 

Also, ISIS attacking Paris right now would be suicide, the army is patrolling the streets.
g...guys?

https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/668160687043125248
The official @OpParisOfficial has just posted that @OpParisIntel is NOT affiliated with them and should not be a trusted source of information.
Anonymous's Twitter says that they didn't say anything about future attacks. https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/668160687043125248
I think its time to unleash Linda Clarke. 
I didn't have a problem with them taking down resources.  I have a big problem with them evaluating threats and making them public with absolutely no experience whatsoever.

By releasing names of cities they will only be adding to the terror and making ISIS more effective or, worse, becoming a disinformation resource for ISIS.
I hope I'm not right, but I'm getting a sinking feeling that there will be Daesh attacks on Sunday and that none of them will be at any of these locations.

Edit: I wasn't right! Hooray!
People dont seem to realize that "Anonymous" is not an organization. It's a label. Anyone can claim to be a member of Anonymous, including ISIS supporters.

That's why this "information" is most likely complete bullshit.
YourAnonNews denies this... 
https://twitter.com/YourAnonNews/status/668160687043125248
Or this is some jack hole jihadi saying he's anonymous and fearmongering
The only thing we can do now is pray that our lord and savior...... JOHN CENA SAVES US THIS SUNDAY NIGHT AT THE SURVIVOR SERIES!!!!! 🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺

But in all seriousness fuck ISIS. 
Attacking the U.S. is like poking a sleeping bear made of angry bees... This will end with troops on the ground if Anonymous are correct.

Edit: I never said I was in support of putting troops on the ground. Stop assuming that I want that.
Whether or not Anon is doing more harm than good aside: this marks the first time we've actually been fucking warned publicly about a specific incident ahead of time, rather than learn how many hundreds of politicians and officials knew of X attack and said/did nothing  years down the road. 
A "journalists" wet dream. No expectations of fact checking or verification. Just sit on your ass, pump out a sensational story and let the clicks roll in. 
What if - what if - Anonymous is actually a cover for US Intelligence that gets to operate without oversight?
I wonder how many people with tickets to that WWE event are going to bail now.  I'd be way too frightened to still actually attend it, regardless of what security measures are in place.
Even ISIS didn't want Roman Reigns to go over on Sunday.
This is the ultimate neck beards of the west vs. neck beards of ISIS. To defeat a neck beard one must think like a neck beard 
Anonymous: Hey FBI, Douche will be attacking these locations on Sunday. 

FBI: OK we'll put some agents there so we can catch the bastards, maybe get some information out of them. Don't broadcast that we have the locations. 

Anonymous: Hey world, locations! 

Douche: Well, guess we'll stay home and diddle kids. We can blow up some other target next week. 
ISIS: Create fake chatter about "imminent attack"

Anonymous: Release said information publicly as a "credible threat"

Public: PANIC

ISIS: Repeat

I am more interested in what Anonymous says about internet activity of ISIS than attacks since Anonymous is probably not good at determining a real threat from a fake one. Maybe they should just share this info with authorities and let them do the vetting. 
Isn't it possible that they in covered information that Isis wanted them to find?
Like what if it was a set up.  Idk just throwing that out there.
It's really embarrassing reddit eats this shit up. 
Finally, Anonymous fighting on the side of the righteous. The vigilante aspect to this appeals to me.
The taking of Sinjar has nearly cut ISIL territory in two.  The group is utterly powerless to prevent the coalition bombing from helping locals retake territory, so in their impotent desperation, they've taken to committing terrorism in the hopes of demoralizing the coalition members.  They weren't bombing planes and shooting cafés when they were winning.
Concrete in Paris is one of the "targets" yet they just published this on their FB: http://i.imgur.com/hdIPZc8.jpg

They claim it's BS, a hoax.

There certainly isn't a single source mentioned in that story, nothing to back it up. 

Why is this currently the top post?
I don't really understand the wank fest over what Anonymous is doing. Do people really think that the authorities aren't already tracking these people?

BS.  If the attacks do happen, they'll be like told you so.  If no attacks occur, then they'll be like we averted them.  Either way they end up being the good guys.
My concern is, if the WWE in Atlanta is a target, the gun rights activists' argument, more people carrying weapons means increased safety, would be put to the test.  In my mind, it'd be like throwing a tennis ball into a room full of mouse traps.  Only need a few loose triggers for chaos to erupt.
Edit: formatting
Two armies of neckbeards enter, only one leaves their basement.
Anonymous anounced on Twitter it was false. They don't know where the rumor comes from.
Considering I'll be at WWE Survivor Series.. This is horrifying. 
&gt;  ISIS has responded to the threat from Anonymous, warning of a reciprocal attack against the activist group.

What is ISIS going to do? Suicide bomb the internet? 
If they could figure all this out, I'm wondering if the U.S gov't also knew about it and by blabbing about it to everyone they are ruining their plans to counter act this.
Is there anything we can do to support Anonymous? 
I went to the grocery store today and saw shit about Black Friday coming up and really wondered if terrorists considered hitting targets like that. That would really strike the "America" they hate. Consumerism combined with Thanksgiving and what it (actually) stands for. 

I don't think we'll see another 9/11 scale event in America but it would be really easy to cause chaos hitting a couple soft targets that are literally impossible to secure. 
... And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!
UPDATE: Anonymous denies finding/releasing details on any possible #ISIS attacks http://on.rt.com/6x8g  

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUXOBVrXAAAhIaj.png:large
This is my crazy theory: 

-Yes there were plans drawn up but ISIS did not intend to carry them all out or even carry any out on Sunday. 

-Anonymous finds these plans and says, "Hey look at what we found! We're better than the government!"

-Sunday rolls around and nothing happens. 

-Anonymous: "See! We stopped the attacks!"
So ISIS plan to attack one of the only WWE events in a in recent memory in which John Cena isn't on the card. Coincidence?
How can you get so many karma for fake news? Anonymous already said they did not said anything about these attacks
I find it hard to believe that the many, very clever intelligent agencies all over the world don't already have this info. Anonymous is just broadcasting it. 
EDIT: add another link

People should stop listening to them, they're just a bunch of teenagers who are desperately looking for attention. [**FBI has said that their info is not credible.**](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/anonymous-hacker-group-isis-atlanta-threat-not-credible-fbi/)

And if you have time, [**please read this post**](http://jesterscourt.cc/2015/11/17/public-service-announcement-media-folks-anonymous-are-suckering-you/) from [**th3j35t3r, a real hacktivist.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jester_%28hacktivist%29) These anon clowns are continuously giving "hacking" a bad name. And no, reporting random Arabic speaking Twitter accounts as ISIS accounts is not hacking. 

&gt;I’m not saying the small core of these idiots who haven’t been turned into ISIS / terror propaganda bots doesn’t have good intentions. I am saying they don’t have the skills, situational awareness, or moral fiber to back that up. With their silly games, they interfere with and devalue the rest of us who are trying to make an actual difference. 


If Anonymous denied, why this clickbait trash is still up?
Same article: 

UPDATE: The same Anonymous Twitter account disavows earlier announcement. 
This is the problem with a group like Anonymous entering into the fray against ISIS. They're a loose connection of people with no central authority, so anyone can make a declaration and it'll be considered as having come from the group at large. Often that's fine, but in this case a group like ISIS can use that weakness to spread more fear.

Anonymous wants to be Batman. Fine. The problem is that Batman has Commissioner Gordon to bounce things off. Unless they open up channels with an actual authority a lot if the information they get won't help anyone or will be used against their goals. 
What never stops amazing me about reddit comments on these types of articles is that so many people are under the impression law enforcement and national security agencies can't do their jobs.
Anonymous [just tweeted] (https://twitter.com/youranonnews/status/668160687043125248) that they don't know where that rumor came from. 
WWE fans!!!! Bring yer guuuuns!!!
Who could have thought ISIS' plans would be undone by 72 virgins?
&gt;we have not shared the information publicly because...

so NOW they understand why government needs to keep secrets from the people?  now they are the hypocrites.
If these are true and occur or are prevented, wouldn't it be amazing that this small organization CAN PREDICT TERRORISTS ATTACKS WITHOUT HARVESTING MY DATA, VIOLATING MY PRIVACY,  AND SPENDING BILLIONS OF TAX DOLLARS.

Obvious I hope nobody gets hurt, except ISIS.
Is this reliable?
Theyre like the avengers but covered in taco bell wrappers.
Go Anonymous!!
Nah. Terrorism doesn't work this way. If they know when, it will be cancelled. 
ISIS has been flooding the channels with chatter about fake attacks to make counterterrorism units expend massive resources. 
FBI is taking the threats seriously
Relatively few ISIS fighters are actually Syrian the vast majority are foreign fighters (relative to Syria + Iraq) Qatar, Saudi Arabia are the main backers of ISIS in terms of money.

I also read a report a few months ago a large amount of Chechens are fighting for ISIS (most likely the surviors of Putins and Mededevs campaign in the Chechen wars) these are hardened fighters who are skilled at tactical warfare even more so then what the Taliban were/are from what I can tell and any ground combat will be bloody since there whole rhetoric is about ground combat vs 'the crusaders' 

They are well equipped as well since they stripped the Iraqi army of most of it's gear and is supplied by Sunni sheiks and princes from the various arab monarchies in the arabian penisular.

There is a reason why they(ISIS) focused on Raqqa/Dabiq since that is a huge focus for the Hadiths (Islamic Teachings) I will quote one of them;

Hadith 6924 states: “The Last Hour would not come until the Romans [NATO/US/UK] would land at al-A’maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people of the earth at that time will come from Medina (to counteract them)…They will then fight and a third (part) of the army would run away, whom Allah will never forgive. A third (part of the army) which would be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah’s eye would be killed and the third who would never be put to trial would win and they would be conquerors of Constantinople [I would imagine Rome since they said many times they want to "march on rome").” 

ISIS sees itself as (any fundamentalist/Extremist group) the Army from god, hence the appeal from foreign jihadis who 'want in' on this.

This is why in my opinion they are the number 1 threat to stability in the globe due to it's global nature.
Actually ISIS is a weird combination of apocalyptic cult and nascent state. They are uncomfortably close to Cobra from G.I.-Joe.

They'd like to take over good chunks of the Middle East and run it according to  their rather  austere form of Islam however as far as can be understood the reason for this to bring on the Apocalypse and have the coming of (IIRC) a figure known as the 12th Iman . Build up, get Mecca and I think Medina destroyed , bring on the Apocalypse. 

Basically ISIS is a death cult operating as a state. Its very weird but not entirely new  historically and shares sentiment with the Aztecs, the stone age mass sacrifice cults , Moloch worship  and with the Utopian ideals of  Communism where it doesn't matter how many die so long as the ideal state is reached. 

They don't care on way or another about Muslims save using them as weapons or if they convert and can be "saved" 

. Its convenient for them that the West has Muslims in it, it lest them easily operate there but if they didn't, they still be busy killing in the Middle East and scheming to cause the end of the world. 

As for chaos in the West, this is standard 4th generation stuff and its nothing new whatever. The West is weak and when you look weak Middle Eastern armies and warbands tend to pounce. This went on well into the early 18th century with slave raids till the US shut them down (c.f The Shores of Tripoli) in the [1st Barbary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Barbary_War)

As for the current situation, there are several ways to end it, 

 ISIS is crushed with utter ruthlessness  at great cost by a multi-national force , we expel millions of Muslims or maybe somehow someone vicious enough in the Middle East comes along and with Western/Russian backing becomes the new Saddam. Alright  we could all surrender and convert I suppose but that isn't an option, the government that tried it would be overthrown and Middle East glassed long before that 

None of the options  are pleasant but if we don't, we'll see constant terror escalating and more deaths at home. 

Our post war age of innocence seems to be ending in the West (Eastern Europe never got one) which is sad but history rolls on. 




Piss off, ISIS. Italy already sucks, no need for you to intervene. Leave us in our filth.
Twitter: @YourAnonNews: We did not spread any rumours about possible future ISIS attacks, and frankly, we do not know where the rumours come from.
Couldn't anonymous avert an attack simply by claiming that it had information on a specific date?  Wouldn't the terrorists just change it to another date?
No they haven't. Stop giving these children attention.
I'm not sure how to feel about locking down entire cities to prevent these attacks.

On one hand it's great that nobody gets hurt. On the other hand, you're just kind of delaying the inevitable. They're going to pick another target and attack that. You're basically letting them live to fight another day.

I guess the goal is to delay them enough until we have the intelligence to find where they live and raid them there?

Praying for my family in Europe...
Isis makes me sick. Its like an itch I can't scratch knowing that these pieces of shit are out there with delusional radical ideals, hiding in plain sightn and normal people can do nothing about it.
 It goes to show how little they care for their own brothers and sisters in Islam , since their actions are going to serve to worsen the situation for those that share some of their physical characteristics and skin tones. Cops are going to be going ape shit tomorrow. Might I make a recommendation to all my middle eastern brothers and sisters of reddit. Becareful out there in the world irrational actions by some lead to irrational actions by others, being those whom will see coffee colored skin and automatically assume that you have ill will/devious machinations towards/in store for them.
Couldn't ISIS just make a shitload of fake information now that they know they are being targeted by Anonymous. That way they can create like 100s of ''plans" just to create paranoia around the world.
Some advice for would be hacktivists, don't publish information publicly so the terrorists know to change their plans and tactics. Instead, give the information to intelligence agencies so they can do their jobs and catch the attackers. 
Let's see... The U.S. pays billions a year to intelligence agencies to uncover &amp; stop terrorist plots.

Anonymous, for free, uncovers a dozen plots and tells the U.S., and the world, about them.

Tell me why, again, we're spending billions of dollars a year on intelligence?
Idk why some of you guys are ripping on Anonymous, they are doing more then you to fight Isis 
I thought we were calling them Daesh.
Title says locations in the US but where's the list of locations??
I feel like they leak this and are using this make everyone scared and cause this exact reaction to then turn around and show radicalized people that they do indeed have power, influence and are feared
Small town living FTW
Just gonna go out on a limb, the attacks won't happen, not because they prevented them, but because there never were any, they are just playing off of hot issues to promote their popularity.
Who is anonymous and why is everyone taking them so seriously?
I really really hope nothing goes down tomorrow.  Fuck terrorism.  
FFDP cancelled their concert tomorrow due to the rumor -

http://m.sixxsense.com/onair/sixx-sense-54580/five-finger-death-punch-cancels-show-14145717/?utm_source=hootsuite
*sigh*

From the headline:

"UPDATE: Anonymous Twitter account disavows earlier announcement about ISIS attack on Sunday"

Jesus Christ. People are scared enough without this bullshit.
So... How long will it take for one member of isis to start becoming a member of anonymous and post false attacks to rip apart any credibility of the group?
Why is this being publicized? Shouldn't "anonymous" (at most a loose collection of basement dwellers) contact the authorities about any information they have gathered so that they can apprehend as many people as possible?
Damn. That's really scary stuff. All of this stresses me out. 

Anonymous is always so enigmatic, but this probably saves hundreds of lives. 

How interesting. 
How isn't the top comment that Anon has said on twitter that they never said this and they don't know here the rumor came from. 
I am skeptical of this. If this is true, then Anonymous gains credibility.  If not this sounds like a false flag, and is a subversive way for governments to push for backdoor encryption resulting in greater surveillance, greater move towards totalitarian states, and greater loss of our rights.
we need to get used to start calling them Daesh
Awesome, fucking shit things are crazy.
Why is this not on major news networks?
Anonymous = CIA?
The problem with Anonymous is that everyone can claim to be Anonymous and anyone can "leak" information that "Anonymous" supposedly uncovered. 
If they are going after 5FDP, its time to call out Avenged Sevenfold. This Means War.
So Anonymous, devoted to a free internet and against mass surveillance decides to mount their own surveillance programme.  

That makes sense.
We have proof. But we can't show it to you. Also, I have a girlfriend, but she lives in Canada.
Well thankfully they got wind of it now 
Damn, I mean, I don't really enjoy Roman Reigns right now, but this is a bit much!
I truly hope the governments of these countries take this seriously.
If this turns out to be true I would be amazed. 
The system administrators dilemma:

Circumvent the tragic event: "why do we pay you?"

Fail to circumvent the tragic event: "why do we pay you?"


And how did they do this?  By illegally monitoring online activity?  People need to get over the concept of online privacy - this is the world we live in now.
What is ISIS' obsession with Paris?
Aka someone posted a thread on 4chan and they saw it? Or was this some sort of hacking venture. 
I'm 60% sure that this is a bunch of bullshit and partially convinced that Daesh will start to 'infiltrate' as anonymous and just shit their image somehow, but I'm really hoping that the other part of me is right, it would be amazing and definitely restores faith in humanity .
BRAVO!!!!!
ISIS wants to fight anonymous? Lol, good luck bombing random basements all over America and the UK.
FBI aware of alleged threat but have no credible Intel of a planned attack.
http://youtu.be/2ZGC6b4eP8Q

Its been done
I hope someone sees this because I have some questions. One, How is it Anonymous found this information and warned us but not NSA? Also, how does the government feel about anonymous releasing this information and warning the people? Does something like this regarding peoples lives have them work together? Thanks
Isn't the fact that this is now public gonna change things? The police in paris wanted to keep things private until the attack was over for this very reason. I hope nothing happens, we dont need more bullshit
You know you're fucked, when the worlds 5 superpowers (USA, China, Russia, GB and France) unite, aswell as Anonymous who can feed them information
isnt IBT one of those clickbait news sites? im not knocking the info though
GO ANONYMOUS GO!
Well, let's hope that the authorities are well aware and are taking the appropriate actions, and that nothing comes of this. 
ISiS vs Anonymous - who wins?
Good thing nobody cares about my country enough to stage a terrorist attack within it. 
Can't find the story on AP or Rueters..
But but. These guys are amateurs. They just used the report button on twitter.

Im sure this is what i was reading morons say in the other topic.

At least someone is doing something about these barbarians.
The anonymous twitter account just tweeted that it never actually said this. 
The oil is a huge economic source for them. Before Isis the Taliban owned that refinery before we came in and cleared it out. Every week they had 300 tanker trucks leaving out because they weren't able to refine it. About 40 million a year comes out of that refinery just in oil they don't have the ability to refine.  
How do people know which Anonymous videos to lend 'credibility' to? Can't anyone just decide to speak for Anonymous? Credibility may be a poor word choice though...
http://imgur.com/eIIC87n Floridiot here, let those fuckers come we're ready. 
RemindMe! 9pm 22nd November "Has anything happened?"
What if all of these places they've supposedly noted to attack are a diversion? Especially on a Sunday where major sports events are taken place all over the world. All of the places listed are going to be strapped to the nines while other areas are left unguarded.
I say they will try something on the 27th. Hollande will be at a commemoration ceremony for the victims of last week's attacks. I think they are going to try killing him; them trying to attack the stadium were he was at seems like a warning.
Sad world we live in now. This may or may not be true. Either way we live in fear. 
Anonymous just tweeted "We did not spread any rumors about possible future ISIS attacks, and frankly, we do not know where the rumors come from."
ISIS makes loads of bullshit claims. They're probably just forwarding spam to the intelligence agencies. 
Anonymous are legends. Fair play to them for stepping up. 
The demonstration in Paris by Collectif du droit des femmes was supposed to be today (saturday) and was cancelled anyway due to last week event.

So the information are not that fresh... and don't really add up.

i commend the post. at least its a heads to up certain events or nearby events to attempt to save lives. thanks any/everyone involved.
I just hope it's not disinformation..
Definitely announce it publicly then so that ISIS can find other means of communication, then.
I know they probably saved lots of lives on Sunday, but what if those guys, now that their plan is revealed, reschedule it? Damn this is scary. They probably should have contacted Interpol/Europol/FBI directly instead of leaking this to the media. I'm sure they know how. 
I will allow that this could be a good thing if they had just taken the information to the related govt agencies,  the problem is as outsiders releasing this information may actually do more harm than good -- there is more than a possibility that this release could burn assets or other actively watched channels that could go dark.

Why would they target Indonesia? Isn't it almost entirely Sunni? 
Now guys, lets not use the term "islamic State", that implies bigotry
Say it loud, say it clear: Daesh has nothing to do with Islam.
Só what are the locations so I'll know not to go there????
Attacking WWE because of the Iron Sheik... Fuck you ISIS
Is John Cena gonna be there?
If this turns out to be legit, they're going to have to give anonymous a medal....
What if we find out that a bunch of random guys are more effective than our entire government... because our government didn't want to be effective?
I have a pretty good idea who is behind the WWE Survivor Series attack plan. http://imgur.com/gallery/rrHGZW4/new?forcedesktop=1
Like that list of government officials who were in the KKK?
The University Pastoral Day (Holy Spirit University of Kaslik, Lebanon) has been cancelled after the Lebanese Army confirms the potential threat to the event.  
Edit: Anonymous might have saved lives. Pretty awesome thing to do from behind a computer.

Even if it doesn't happen there's no reason this should be ignored.
We'll see, and I'm sure security forces are on elevated alert, but I would be just as prone to believe this "intelligence" uncovered by the amateurs was the original misdirection used by ISIS and these groups to cover the recent attacks.  They are more organized and intelligent than most give them credit for, and one of the best ways to distract intelligence and surveillance agencies monitoring you would be to convince them that you were planning an attack on day "X", but then strike early on different targets while they were still "preparing" their interventions... 
Two things;

1) If the American target is a WWE match and I got about 500 comments into the thread and there was no IASIP reference to the Talibum I am disappointed.

2) To the naysayers that insinuate that the WWE not being a valid target, there are probably targets that would instill a greater panic but honestly *any* attack on American soil, close to a holiday weekend, in front of a huge shopping season, even if they just knicked a guy with a box cutter and then got gunned down by beat cops, is going to cause a panic which might seriously impact the economy. If your grandmother is not out shopping for your Christmas socks, we could lose a pile of money the next two months. That said we had a couple of mall shootings last year during the season for shopping and the response was pretty non-panicky for something like that.

Just sayin'.
Damn, good job, Anonymous! 
I have a bad feeling about this. These bastards seem to be escalating their attacks. Sunday is a day where you can find a lot of people together all over the world... Hope nothing else happens and this doesn't keep accelerating. 
ISIS is going to wear Guy Fawkes masks in all their new beheading/propaganda videos...make it awkward.
it is the moral duty of all european nations to accept as many moslems as will fit within their borders.
The article infuriates me.  
ISIS (or whatever the pig fuckers go by) wants to spread fear, and the article is helping them.
All I can say is that I hope they catch all these fuckers. It's something that should have been taken seriously a long time ago. Ever since they started to have the training and resources to occupy entire cities. All of this should have never happened.
so ISIS are now going to royally piss the USA off now too, smart....

Nuh uh
Pretty funny how everyone here is complaining, that Anonymous is just a loose and always changing group of people without any centralized organisation and completely ignore the fact, that the same is true for ISIS... ;)
If this is true, this means a rough collection of internet weirdos is more effective than the CIA, NSA, etc. 

Which is sad as shit..... Or really heartening I suppose?
Here's what I think will happen, none of those places will be attacked. Either because they weren't going to be attacked in the first place or because the disclosures scared Isis off. Either way it helps.  Our governments probably have access to the exact same information but our governments will never tell us what the targets are. They just simply say that the alert is high and to watch out, which means nothing. Unless one of the targets matches anonymous announcement actually blows up people will start to lose faith in any of the anonymous predictions. Plus the fact that anonymous is unverifiable in the first place. There is also the danger that because Isis knows which communications channels they used to plan these various targets that also tells them which communications channels that Anonymous is monitoring.
[deleted]
How do we know the terrorists haven't infiltrated Anonymous?
Too bad ISIS is behind 7 proxies
war of misinformation started.  I hope anonymous doesn't become a distraction.
Any attacks ocurred yet?
Why isn't this information coming up anywhere else? 

Shouldn't the media be talking about this?
The worst part is that even if this is real nobody will believe it. 
But at the same time it makes Government look bad for not stopping it. 

But if it's misinformation, governments look bad for not being prepared or if they are prepared.
"Wow you didn't try to stop it." vs. "Wow you're dumb enough to fall for it."
I think it's interesting these two factions are warring themselves. You gotta actually cheer on Anonymous.
ITT: Everyone's an intelligence specialist 
Anonymous denies this.  The post should be downvoted.
Everyone come to NZ no one wants to hurt us :^)
I have a feeling something like the Tet offensive will happen very soon with terrorists all over the globe committing terrible acts.

I promise you that any planned attack on a WWE event in the South of USA will be met with more guns than they will bring.  
So Syria is like a second Vietnam, second Korea. Proxy wars for everyone!
The ground forces are there primarily to guard the Russian airforce and bases, not to act as assault troops.


"Russia deployed more than 50 combat aircraft in Syria, along with some 4,000 troops. About half of them were already there as advisers and technicians, while most of the rest are ground forces needed to protect the pilots and various bases."
— Source http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/09/world/europe/confirmation-of-attack-on-russian-jet-may-strengthen-putins-resolve-in-syria.html?ref=world
For the uninitiated, the Express is not too different from the National Enquirer in the US. The publication is complete trash, and they could very well have pulled that 4,000 figure out of their asses. I've got my salt shaker out for now...
*"THE number of Russian military forces in Syria has reportedly swelled to 4,000 as Vladimir Putin continues his bid to destroy the Islamic State."*

According

to

*WHOmmmmmmmmm*

edit: the World Health Organization jokes are bad and you should feel bad.
RUSH SYRIA BLYAT DONT STOP.
Anyone else thinking, "That's fine, let him have it?"

I don't like Putin or Assad... but I decided a while ago that I preferred them to ISIS.
To wipe out the Islamic State AND any Syrian citizen that wants to remove Assad.
ISIS leadership be like: In retrospect, shouldn't have blown up that jetliner. Shouldn't have done that.
Good.  Let the Russians fight ISIS.  
Good. Let Russia get bogged down in an endless quagmire instead of us for a change. We can pay for universal health care with the savings. Besides, Russia is probably willing to get as dirty as it takes to beat ISIS. Americans don't have the stomach for what it will take to destroy ISIS.
I think ISIS is being used as a blanket term, and Putin's forces are more-so heading for the area occupied by Al Nusra
Genuine questions guys. Does anyone else think this will be a bad idea in the long run? I just feel like that you can't truly kill an ideology no matter how many people you kill. Yeah, you can kill all the "Extremists", but some of the normal Muslims might see this and be willing to join and thus creating a trickle down effect of more radical islamic groups. Is this really the ONLY way to handle the situation? Please elaborate your thoughts, and thanks.
I thought as little as a few weeks ago Putin said he had no intention/desire to send ground troops into Syria?
I thought he banned Russians from vacationing in those areas?
&gt;The Russian foreign ministry refused to comment on the size of Mr Putin's contingent yesterday.

Well that's just good manners. 
More like "prop up Assad".  Only the most Kool-Aid addled Putinfluffer would think Russia is there for anything else. 
As an American... Let him do it, get out of the way. 
Kadyrov asked putin already if hes allowed to send his chechen army to syria
Good. Kill them all.
It's not about Assad. It's about who controls oil/gas to Europe.
Assad supports a [Russian backed gas pipeline along with Iran-Iraq-Syria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Iraq-Syria_pipeline).
The US supports [an alternate pipeline](http://oil-price.net/en/articles/oil-prices-and-syrian-civil-war.php) that runs from Qatar, to, you guessed it, Syria.

Read up on the collapse in oil prices and you'll see how the whole world has turned upside down due to new players in the oil market.

Same as it ever was!
I hope Putin adds a couple of 0's to that number.  
ELI5: How does this compare to the Russian occupation of Afghanistan?
I am all for the destruction of ISIS and if Putin wants his troops to do it, more power to them.
You know, the only thing I can say is Putin has the political capital to see this through to the end and Russians in general seem stone hearted enough to wage an effective counter insurgency campaign.
Good. I hope Putin can take care of it so the US doesn't have to for once. Now they can take the heat when they do something everybody knows has to happen but still has to act pissed about.
Good.  Let Russia draw the ire of all the ISIS fanatics.  Perfect time for America to bring our troops home if you ask me.  
I'm old and lazy so I 'll blame my lack of references on Reddit's lousy search engine but... sometime in the last year a user whose name escapes me posted a really knowledgable and well referenced comment relevant to this. I'm not sure if ISIS was really relevant in Syria at the time but Russia was. It had to do with a Russian Syrian and Iranian project to run a natural gas or oil line that would be very competitive with current (western) energy distribution to Europe.  I suspect the real motivation for Russian/Iranian support/intervention is no different from US motivation - $$$

Sorry for the lack of paragraphs (phone and scotch)
Maybe I'm getting my news from a different place to everyone, but my impression was that Putin and Russia are demonstrably not fighting ISIS, but rather mainly focussed on the rebels that are fighting Assad but are not ISIS? And that only a tiny handful of strikes are actually hitting ISIS targets?

I appreciate that this jetliner/bomb thing may have changed things, but it could just as easily be used as a pretext to accelerate the existing campaign and achieve their original strategic goals quicker. 

Everyone seems completely on board with the media narrative that Russia is going in and kicking ISIS's ass, but from the middle eastern news I've been seeing, that's simply not what has been happening. 
Russian Army is keep shoot until nobody shoot back.  Work great success 1941-1945.
Yes! YES! **GO RUSSIA!**
waiting for some c-grade Western human rights org to blame Putin for violating the rights of ISIS terrorists.
Why Russia will not remove Assad.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_naval_facility_in_Tartus
Good - kill all ISIS and all the anti-Assad forces. Prop Assad's ass up and keep him in control.  These people (Arabs and the Middle East in general)  are not capable of governing themselves. They need dictators to control them and to stabilize the area. 

I wish we could dig up Saddam and put his carcass back in control of Iraq.  W fucked up so bad.....
Good. Let someone else fight the Islamists for once. Any way we can get China involved? 
And we should wish them well and take lots of pictures but that is all we should do. 
Just like Russia wiped out the Mujahideen in the 80's, right?!?!
"Islamic State" isn't much of anything. All is takes is somes willing to go in and take no prisoners and spare no lives. Wipe them the fuck out, which is what Putin is doing. Obama has been too much of a fucking pussy to do anything about it. I'm glad someone has the balls.
Easier to bitch at Putin than to question Obama I guess?


He'll need a lot more than that.
Never forget, this is the Arab Spring that began a little over two years ago, starting in Morocco, across North Africa, in an arc up the Middle East, now heading into Eastern Europe. A lot of people were cheering the "overthrow of tyrants" back then, which has developed to building turmoil across the region. Almost everybody has forgotten that IS started from the Iraq Republican Guard and regulars sent "home" by the US after defeating Saddam, about 300,000 Suni, that had nowhere else to go but go north, to south Syria. Bush and company also decided to not destroy all the weapon warehouses up north because those would be for the new government. People over use the term "train wreck", this is a gigantic train wreck in slow motion. The Russians do have a lot more justification for sending troops to Syria than the US has for being involved at all, except trying to mop up the mess Bush and company left with their bank bailout money in their pockets. Also, the pallets of billions of dollars helped out a lot too. They thank their fellow American suckers...people. 
Who cares as to *why* he does it. Its he **does** it that is beneficial to the world in the long run.. 
Okay, so we're all fighting against ISIS. That much I get. And then we (US) are also fighting for the Kurds, and Russia is fighting for the current Syrian government? Sounds like a proxy war.
the benefit of having putin around - he's got zero red tape when it comes to waring
If Russia wants to enter into a war in the Middle East than yeah, fine.  But it's naive to think that they will have any more success than any other power has had fighting there since WWII.  I say let them spend some $ and make a mess out of themselves.  Putin is doing the same thing Bush II did, which is to distract his population from domestic issues.  
Tinfoil,:

Putin blew up their plane knowing ISIL would take responsibility for obvious propaganda reasons, as a way to establish a military force in Syria obfuscating American interverventionism. 
...and gain control of Syria for the Mother Land

Hell hath no fury like an ex-KGB scorn'd. #amirite
I honestly think this is all a game to Russia, the USA and everyone involved. The US had 100,000 troops in Afghanistan and 160,000 troops in Iraq at one point, those wars lasted over 10 years and cost trillions of dollars. How much land does ISIS control now? What are 4000 Russian soldiers going to do to ISIS? Everything that you see now is just keeping the war machine running. Supplying weapons, conducting air campaigns, training people who will use your own weapons against you one day, all amounts to nothing. This is just about spending money to keep the weapons manufacturing system running. This is about testing sophisticated weaponry against an enemy that will always be there to shoot at, but never shoot back, this is about protecting military positions. I think the Americans are sick of wars; wars they do not understand, wars that are never won or lost. When most of your allies are just lesser evils, when dictators use chemical weapons on their own people, when kids are raised at birth to defeat the enemies of Allah and destroy the infidels what do you do? There is nothing to do anymore. Obama knows there is no winner here, no taking down ISIS, no taking down Assad, no working with the Russians. 4000 troops or 40,000 troops will not make a difference. This is not a proxy war, this is a game. The mission is to keep the machine running without breaking the bank and without sending your troops to die. Let's not fool ourselves thinking there is a real solution. The Refugees flooding Europe know that there is nothing left at home and there never will be. None of what is going is actually about ISIS, Assad, Syria, Rebels, or Iraq anymore. 
Can some say Afghanistan 1980's... 
..go Putin?
4,000 Russian troops... Keyword there is "Russian"
Y'all just fucked up now, ISIS
Putin for pres!
How dare those Russians.. tryna be Americans.
US got their fair share under Bush so it's Russia's turn for a quagmire.
Finally glad they fucked with the wrong person.  
Thank you Putin
I'm continually amazed at the depth of the ignorance of conservatives, who think US forces have been standing off from this conflict:

From [June, 2015](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/iraq-war-on-terror/rise-of-isis/what-an-estimate-of-10000-isis-fighters-killed-doesnt-tell-us/):

&gt; It’s been more than eight months since the United States mobilized a coalition and launched a campaign of airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Despite the strikes hitting more than 6,200 targets, it has been difficult to measure the coalition’s success against ISIS.

&gt; On Wednesday, a senior U.S. official offered one measure of progress when he told a French radio network that airstrikes had killed 10,000 ISIS fighters since the campaign began.

&gt; “We have seen enormous losses for Daesh [ISIS],” Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken told France Inter. “More than 10,000 since the beginning of this campaign. That will end up having an effect.”
And by Islamic State he means any troops not loyal to Assad 
looks like bestgore is going to be getting a lot of new content :^)
"Putin metaphorically shows his dick to President Obama"
Obama doesn't have a leg to stand on here. Saying this needs a political resolution in Syria is almost as bad as doing nothing. A political solution in Iraq is more plausible, but even then only after major combat operations destroy ISIS strongholds. 

And 4K troops on the ground won't get squat done in Syria if it's being presented as Russian boots on the ground taking an active combat role. The day 40k are on the ground in Syria will mean Putin is serious about taking the fight to ISIS, and that will probably be the bare minimum needed to take and hold ground with Assads forces. 4K is nothing more than a security contingent.
I'm not not saying anything, but haven't we seen this a few times before? Country itching to go to war, suspicious terrorist attack occurs, finally can go to war?
I just love how Putin doesn't give a fuck and is handling it.
Why do I keep thinking of Norway 1940?
Ok that is a good news after all. All the best. ;)
Can we (the US) pack it in now? Russia's got this.
Is it bad that I wanted this to happen. And hope he completely wipes them out.
Hope they nuke the fuckers. Quick and easy
Cool, so can we stay out of it this time? That would be super. 
In Soviet Russia, we terrorize terrorists!
Syria is Afghanistan II for the Russians, Vietnam III for the Americans. Let the show begin. 
Good, I hope Putin wipes every last little Islamic fuck right off the map.  Maybe he will also wipe the assholes out that are supplying them also.
Whenever I read about Russia sending troops anywhere all I can think of is Hell March from Red Alert I
Go for it, Comrade. 
can America just stay out of this one
What infuriates me is that not many people listen to what Syrians have to say. The only people who have the right to determine who governs the Syrian people, are Syrians; the lack of anger against American and overall, western attempts to undermine the Syrian government and put weapons in the hands of this so called 'fsa' is baffling. Talk to pretty much any Syrian out there and they will more than likely declare support for Assad and the Russian intervention and will give you a fairly detailed description of what REALLY happened in homs 'peaceful protests' 2011.
S for Source

And i don't see it.
He's doing what the PC west doesn't have the balls to do.
US: "We need to take out ISIS!"
Russia: "We're going to take out ISIS!"
US: ...

(We've pretty obviously been letting ISIS do whatever they want, because we don't like Assad or his ties to Russia.)
Finally, someone is willing to take action against ISIS and for stability in the middle east instead of just sowing more discord in the region.
Putin's goal is to bombard europe with as many Syrian refugees as possible. 
Talk about a one-sided story.  This web site must be reprinting press releases directly from the Kremlin.
I'll bet Putin has a much higher degree of success in the region than the US and Western allies have experienced.

Carpet bomb the ISIS controlled areas. Turn them into sheets of glass. You do this to the largest concentrated area, you cut off the head of the hydra. If that's not enough, you similarly target the next concentrated area, and so on, and so forth...

Eventually you will have demolished them physically, and psychologically. Their infrastructure will be non-existent. They will have no choice but to play ball, or they will cease to exist.
Except he's not going to fight the Islamic State...
Better Russia than USA
Thank God! Putin is Hero! Do something about evil ISIS group!
The nukes better not fly before I finish Fallout 4.
It seems pretty obvious how this will go. Putin is there to support the Assad regime, not "wipe out IS."

They will end up bombing out "advisers" or we will bomb their "security personnel." One way or another the forces will collide. One thing will lead to another the way these things do. 

Few of us take war seriously enough today. War is pretty much the most awful thing there is. It is a fire that is easy to start and difficult to put out.  
White House be like:  

&gt; Shit, Putin, you're fucking up our plan to funnel ISIS into outing Assad.  We didn't actually want to kill ISIS.

Putin be like:  Fuck off with what you want, ya greedy bitches!
Rebel groups*, not ISIS.
Putin to America:

"Dibs."

America: "Uhh... What?"

"WE'Z CALLZ THE DIBZ!!"
You cannot wipe out an idea by force of arms. Especially a religious one. It takes education, good government, and social services.
Wow. We send 50 troops. They respond by sending 4,000. (this probably isn't a direct response, but it's still a huge escalation.)
Wow.  This thread contains more Stupid per square inch than any other spot on the Internet.
Russian only has 6 Sukhoi-34 fighter bombers in Syria, it's the only aircraft capable of dropping accurate smart bombs. It uses the French made Damocles targeting pod. However, the SU-34 is new, it requires 4 hours ground maintenance for 1 hour in the air. There's too few and the aircraft is underused. 

The other aircraft, SU-25 and Su-24M2, drop dumb bombs. OK the SU-25 uses a GLONASS/GPS augmented missile guidance computer that may increase the accuracy of its dumb bombs but it's unreliable. The Su-24M2 is outdated, introduced in 1974, it's due to be retired in 3 - 4 years time.

The bottom line is, despite having 4000 troops in Syria, Russian intervention has not been the game changer that was expected. And it won't be unless they stop using aircraft and weaponry that mostly dates from 1970s and 80s. That's 3 to 4 to years away.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhoi_Su-34

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles_(targeting_pod). 
4,000 is too few.

I would've sent 200,000 and gotten that shit over with in 2 weeks. Everyone back home for Christmas.
Is this on top of the 4,000 already there?
Well more covoys 200 i guess.
To the sands comrades!
"But there are no Russian troops in combat roles in Syria, according to a spokesman for the Kremlin.

He added that forces are guarding Russia's bases in the west of the country – and working with the Syrian military. "

Didn't he accuse us, the USofA, of pussyfooting around? Didn't he say he was going to do it "right"? Did he just steal our playbook?
“If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.” -Sunny Kazoo
How many times do I have to tell Putin to stop Putin troop into Syria smh 
Pump dat oil price back up putin
He steps up his bed to wipe out the moderate *rebels*
Welcome to the Swamp
Chenchnya 3.0 when
Putin wants to increase Russia/Putin's political clout in the world and to provide a counter balance to the need for aspiring powers to play by the US rules in order to be successful. 

He plans on doing this by demonstrating Russia's unconditional loyalty to its allies. In other words, it doesn't matter how many people you have killed, Russia will always be your friend if you are loyal to Russia. And because of Russia's security council veto, regional status, and general ability to exersize the power of the "vetocracy" this is a winning formula for them. 


We should just peace out and let them handle it, everyone wins.
Shit now I support Putin. Fuck! 
Not sure why people are so bent out of shape about this. ISIS bad, Putin bad. Putin will not defeat ISIS, but he will weaken it, and in doing so also himself. Other than propping up Assad and cementing an alliance with Iran, Russia doesn't get much out of this even if all goes perfectly. And if all does go perfectly, then at least ISIS is dead. Russia does not have much of a winning history with respect to protracted wars in the Middle East...
I hope there will be some joint operations with the US. It probably won't happen but I think it would be a cool first for the military history books. Kinda like task force K-bar
In the interest of accuracy, isn't it more fair to say that Putin's real goal is to support Assad? 
4000 troops against ISIS??? I thought they had tens of thousands of fighters/terrorists/whatever you want to call that scum.

I see he his putin' on a good show..

So, is Russia on our side?? Or not? Or just what the hell is going on?
The US stands to look a little silly if Russia comes in and does in a few months what we've been trying for years to accomplish.
Putin's goal is to bombard europe with as many Syrian refugees as possible. 
WW3
As an American, can't we just sit this one out?
Russia can waste it forces fighting another Afghanistan and ignore eastern Europe where he'd actually win.

The sad part is the 98% of the population that doesn't want or need war or anymore deaths. 

But this is really an absolute nightmare for worldwide stability. The situation we have now is unlike anything we have seen before in the region. Nations which have spent decades in peace now have tensions, new alliances are rapidly being formed, Russia is invading Syria, 3 different civil wars are raging, the Turks have reignited their war with the Kurds, a massive revolution in Egypt, a unpredictably powerful Islamic Caliphate with intentions of genocide and territory has formed in the heart of the land, and all the while we have a coalition of allied powers flying the skies, bombing the ground.

And just to top it off, we have the largest refugee crisis in modern history coming straight for Europe.

This is quite the disaster we have seen in the Middle East in just the past 4 years, and its about to enter a new, much more dangerous stage.
People who fail to observe history are doomed to repeat it's mistakes.
Bless Putin for his righteous mission to stop IS!!!!! 
That is a **HUGE ESCALATION.** Holy shit. I never thought Putin of all people, having directly joined the conflict so recently, would put boots on the ground before the US or NATO
Or aims to get oil perhaps. 
About time. 
And there it is.
And somehow he is the bad guy. You goys need to stop listening to mainstream media.
That number will only increase
Thank god for Putin, the only world leader doing anything proactive towards dealing with the Islamic State.  
"Bid to wipe out the Islamic state" (read: wipe out anti Assad rebels.
Damn shit just got real. Personally I applaud Putin. The US should now just get the fuck outta the way and let Russia spend there blood and treasure on this mess.
go putin
Hopefully Russia wipes these scumbags off the face of the planet
Well, at least we'Lloyd get some good combat videos from this whole thing.
cold war's back without a doubt
If you go to Al Jazeeras comment page almost half the people claim this is some Jewish Zionist conspiracy. 
all i know for sure is that western countries are too busy blowing citizens with drones and then worrying about human rights (irony, right?), but here comes russia to actually do something productive, and at the same time kill less citizens than the us is doing right now. 
Good
Or he could send in his motorcycle gang so as to stir up trouble and use that as an excuse to invade...
History Repeats Its Self
President Obama has had a lackluster response to the rise of the Islamic State in part because he knows he can't solve the problem. This could be a brilliant move on Putin's part, but it could also show his arrogance. Does he honestly believe he can wipe out terrorism in the Middle East as a foreign power, or is this just some political BS for ulterior gains? Is this how he'll maintain the economy even given sanctions? Either way, his growing venture into the Middle East is likely going to be a bad decision economically and militarily. The US knows this from recent experience. How is Russia going to be different?
Well, considering that he helped the rise of ISIS in Syria in the first place by aiding Assad, he probably has a responsibility to end it.
I hope they hunt down every last one of those child-murderers
Their troops sorely needed combat experience. I wonder if they will be releasing the names of the contingents already there?
Well...Shit is about to hit the fan
At this point, I hope he does. 
Putin was in the KGB. He should be intimately familiar with what happened to the USSR in Afghanistan, so he should know how this ends...
rip in macaroni isis
Thanks Put!
Let them bankrupt themselves trying to throw their weight around and proving their a super power. We in the U.S. can continue to recover from the 2 endless wars we entered a decade ago. 
I don't like a lot of what Putin's done lately, but at least he actually has a plan.
awww fuck yea. /r/combatfootage is about to get a ton of great new videos of Russians kicking ass in HD!
Yes, finally someone is doing something.
That site looks super credible.
This all might just be Putin wanting to justify his war chest budgets, get rid of aging weaponry, test new weapons, secure oil assets, and show his country and the world what military power he possesses.  This is a 50/50 chance he'll actually make a dent.  The other 50 will be Russia suffering for meddling with affairs and the sure slaughter of the region.  IMO I hope Putin allows a couple PAK-FA fighters and that new light tank to test ordinance on soft targets.  
The more islamist they kill the better the world becomes. "Go russia, go Russia, go go go" gotta sing it like the TMNT song.
I hope the Russians, or anybody for that matter, wipes those fucks out. And most importantly I hope they know that after they do that it is absolutely required to win the hearts and minds of the people who remain. This is expensive but well worth it. Build up their infrastructure and embrace their culture. Help them succeed. If this isn't done there will be another group to pop up. 
This is going to make for an awesome movie
the title is deceptive in that Russia already had 4000 troops deployed in Syria before the reported terror attack on the civilian airplane 
Our totally deserving Noble Peace prize winning President, everyone!
I'll just sit here and wait for the U.S. and Russia to split up Syria within the decade.
gg wp.
Inb4 4000 beheading videos.
Afganistan 2.0, no 3.0
ISIS: WHAT IS..IS going on?
How many soldiers are estimated to be in ISIS? 
Yaall done goofed Isis.
Afghanistan...For everyone thinking Russia can just go wipe em out...sigh
Putin: Getting shit done. 
fuck em up Russia
Based Putin, clearing out the jihadi problem for us. Let him have good fun, and leave him with whatever mess is left over. 
Russia! Fuck yeah!
You came to the wrong neighborhood, motherfucker.
Wooooo! Go get em! 
I really wonder what took so long honestly, If Syria such a close tie?
I thought he wasn't even targeting ISIS...
Is it possible that this is a good thing?  Asking because I do not know.
Uh-oh, i feel like this is going to snowball into a vietnam war, but instead there are russians and isis.

This is not good.
Think of all the money we here in the US of A just saved!  Thanks Obama!  Thanks Putin!
Some Syrian village is about to get pillaged in retaliation for that jet going down.
The Russia should go fuck everything up rhetoric in this thread is alarming 
At this point I'm ready to say to hell with it and just let Russia get their hands in Syria. I mean how much worse could it possibly get? Hell, it may even earn Putin some brownie points with the West if he can stem the flow of refugees into southern Europe.
ITT: international foreign relations experts 
I didn't get the comments in the last thread saying he wouldn't send foot soldiers in
&gt;Bid to wipe out US Proxies
One quick way to begin hurting ISIS would be to start shipping anti-aircraft missiles to the Houthis in Yemen.
ELI5 why this is a bad thing.
The high def drone footage will be AWESOME!!!
I don't care who it is, but someone needs to step in, slaughter ISIS, and restore order to Syria. It used to be a region that people spoke extremely well of. Now they don't even harvest their main crop. This is pathetic, and any true Arab will agree.
So, are we going to come out with Rambo IV where Rambo joins the Russians to fight the Islamic Fighters?
So while while diplomacy is amazing, when it fails like it is he who wants peace the most naturally gets the worse deal.
&gt; The claim, **which could not be independently confirmed**, comes on the heels of twin suicide attacks the previous day in the far north of Cameroon, an area repeatedly targeted by the jihadists.

Yahoo is literally repeating their propaganda as news.
Is this like one of those things the Nigerian Army does where they say they killed thousands of enemy when in reality it was probably less than 50? 
If it didn't add up to a perfect 1,000, I'd be less suspicious.
Wow way to go James Cameroon.  Found time during busy Avatar 2 shooting schedule to free hostages.
Bravo to the Cameroonian army. Keep it up.
&gt;Over the past year Boko Haram has stepped up cross-border attacks in Niger, Chad and Cameroon while also continuing to mount shooting and suicide assaults on markets, **mosques** and other mostly civilian targets within Nigeria itself.

I feel like I read about Islamic terrorist killing other Muslims all the time. It's almost like they don't quite get how to win supporters.
How would they provide food and water to 900 people?
Wow Cameroon actually did something that got on the news!
https://i.imgur.com/gQ42YjW.jpg
Plot twist - 800 of those hostages were Boko Haram fighters that "switched sides" once they saw what was happening.
[deleted]
I truly hope all of this is true, but I sorely doubt it. They probably killed 10 people and freed 30 hostages
Didn't know David Cameroon had his own army. Good going, Sir!
Iam soo proud of my dear country , it might be propaganda but oh well! for once, Cameroon is not featured on an ebola-poverty- shitstorm article *snif*       THUMBS UP to the BIR (or version of the SWAT) 
"Cameroon army kills 100 Boko Haram fighters" - Cameroon Army, 2015
David Cameroon? What a win for the Tories!!! 
For a split second I read: "Cartoon army kills..."

As if I don't already have a hard time understanding this world.. 
ITT:

Internet: Rumors of bad news

Reddit: "Holy shit everyone get your pitchforks, the world is ending, society is going to shit."

Internet:  Good news reported

Reddit: "I don't believe you"
Probably massively inflated...
100 is too convenient a number. Something doesn't feel right 
If there's a positive polar opposite that happened in the world from the San Bernardino shooting, this is it.
Unless a Nigerian prince chimes in and confirms the story, I shall remain skeptical. 
FINALLY SOME FUCKING GOOD NEWS
How do you even begin to feed 900 hosta........oh
Good. Wipe out the Boko Harams.
Awesome strike Cameroon!
1000 good things happened today :)
So that's like a net gain of +1000
Africa solving African problems. How Africans are going to make Africa a better place for future Africans...  
How did a regional army fight Islamist extremists without the US invading?
When Cameroon was in Egypt's land...
  
Let my Cameroon go...
Meanwhile in the US people are getting shot by idiots with guns and the NRA armed forces were no where to be seen.
CAM-E-ROON! CAM-E-ROON! CAM-E-ROON!
Respect for cameroon and they know the pain of [oppression](http://www.ccdhr.org/photogallery/Demonstration%20Banner.JPG) and that is why they are fighting for it no matter what race or country *hats off* 
Anyone else feel like: For fuck's sake, who didn't do what to allow for 900 people to be taken hostage. That is a metric fuck load of people. That is fucking ridiculous. I'm glad the Cameroonian army finally did something, but Jesus fucking Christ. 
at first I read this as "Cartoon army 'kills 100 Boko haram fighers, frees 900 hostages'"
I only saw it here and that comment popped into my head i haven't found it either
Better than the alternative Cameron.
Ima chug a beer for that.  
Good job guys!
Fuck yah boys!  I don't think anybody should be keeping a harem these days ya know?
Great use of 'quotes'.
Bravo if this actually happened, though not sure if it really did. 
999,999,999,900 left to go
There has to be a way to lure these impressionable monkeys to their deaths. I mean they were lured into doing this shit, these fuckers are easily enticed. We should pull a reverse Hitler and gas the genocidists.
Read it as 'Cameron's army' :o
Total fatalities: 6 people and 100 terrorists.
hopefully they pissed on the faces of the boko haram corpses after they killed them. 
Wow way to go James Cameroon.  Found time during busy Avatar 2 shooting schedule to free hostages.
Good. Fuck em'.
so now reddit is repeating propaganda news?
Great, just another exaggerated kill count. Nothing to see here, maybe some hostages freed in exchange for a few footlongs.

EDIT: Apparently, this is true. The count that Cameroon gave "could not be independently confirmed."
what is this?  a superman army???   lol fucking cameroon lol
I don't even know what a 'Cameroon' is..
Buncha Liberal mumbo jumbo if you ask me
/s
I used to live in Cameroon
fuck yeah! yaounde represent! 
If thats true thats pretty decent. Russia would have killed all the hostages as well.
How were 100 people holding 900 others hostage?
this is not in the press
Dayum. 
Am I the only one who thought that said cartoon army?
Thank the hashtags!
Fuck yeah samuel eto'o
If this is true.  I'm ok with it. 
You go Cameroon! 
What "new multinational force" is in Cameroon? Is it UN? Are there Americans?
I feel weird upvoting murder.  
Taking 100 lives to save 900 ones sound fine by me
That's gr8, m8
How Africans are going to be taken hostage.
How and why does an organisation have 900 hostages at once? 
This should be in /r/upliftingnews
Damn, Cameroon is doing a better job than the US. Good for them!
I read this as "Cartoon" army, I was very confused, but kind of excited at the same time.

&gt;The minister attributed the success of the raid to cooperation between Cameroon security forces, a new multinational force being set up to fight Boko Haram and Nigeria's army.

**My inner grammar nerd found the perfect use case for the serial comma.**
Finally! Someone has responded to all of those #bringbackourgirls tweets we have long forgot about!
Go David Cameroon and his army!
Camaroon Batoon going to toown 
Reddit be like, "don't give cops locations away"

"Hostages are being routed here: *google maps link*"

"Victims are being routed to this hospital *google maps link*"
It doesn't matter if they only killed one.. That's one less wanker in the world
I expect the numbers are far, far lower. However, don't take anything away from their endeavour. 
Bravo to the wrong mosques.
Net profit:800
nice work boys
It's World Cup '90 all over again!
|neutralised more than 100 jihadists

They didn't kill anyone, they just neutralized some threats.

Edit: spelling
I opened the link and got a prompt to install the yahoo app. Noped the fuck out. Yahoo news is too sensationalist for my tastes.
Good. Wipe out the Boko Harams.
I hope there were plenty of gutshots. 
100 dead and 900 rescued just seems too fake of a number.
Profit?!?!?!
Oh, I dunno about all that.
Not gonna lie, I was a little confused at first as to how a cartoon army killed 100 Boko Haram, and why it was on /r/worldnews.
So 10 killed 90 rescued.  Kk
TIL: Cameroon is pretty pedantic about the definition of 'decimate'...
"allegedly"
This is made up.
wooo go Cameroon
If true, this is good news.

Good. Wipe out the Boko Harams.
GO ON LADS, YOU'RE ALRIGHT YOU
TONITE WE FREED 6 MILLION HOSTAGES AND KILL 69 BILLION TERRORSISTS! Are you not entertained!?
Dont mess with the army of Cameroon. 
Fuck yeah, good, that's what I like to hear. 
Awesome...another one of the worlds worst terrorist organizations takes a blow!
That said, there's measures that can be substantiated, that's just not how shit works over there it appears.
Camer*ooooooooooooo*n!
Fucking David Cameron gets around. 
FINALLY SOME FUCKING GOOD NEWS
They could probably have gotten rid of them all by now if they invited Westerners in to help. 
Thanks David Cameroon
My point is that journalism in Cameroon for 2 years and my Cameroonian husband is there right now.
How Africans are going to make it more believable.
Why only now?
They do things differently but still the teachings of the claim in their campaign.
Reports from within Washington are the reports of the best thing about filmmaking.
More like four plants worth of cannabis with a known terrorist are terrorists by association.
I thought it said Cameron army
James Cameroon does the things James Cameroon does the things James Cameroon does the things James Cameroon does...for James Cameroon.
While I agree, the problem is it's based in some truth.
Out of approximately 10,000,000 Redditors there are 10 people and freed 30 hostages Didn't know David Cameroon had his own army.
The US PR firm hired by that foreign government to push its propaganda into the camp in order to ease administration of careful medical attention.
This would be a better place for future Africans...
Obama will take FULL credit for this, even though he did nothing.

Is this like one of those things the Nigerian Army does where they say they killed thousands of enemy when in reality it was probably less than 50? 
Some of the real fighting, then the Nigerian mercenary forces that are paid for by the standards of even a poor country to provide for all the prisoners.
I'm always curious about these nice round numbers. How'd they count the 100 Boko Haram fighters? How do they count those 900 hostages? 
Sooooo, probably 20 and 90 using the standard militia Dick measuring formula?
Good 
Most americans are like

"What is a cameroon, and why is it killing Dragon Ball Z characters?"
Good work, **Islamists will fall to the power of socialism!**
Who's Boko Haram? Oh, right, that Muslim terror group who kills more people than ISIS.  But their victims aren't white people, so who cares.

-- worldnews
So the hostages outnumbered their captors 9 to 1.

Are we supposed to believe this? Jesus...
Great. Now I want macaroons.
Good lads
for a split second there I was like, where did David get his own army...
Muslims should start cautioning their children in Boko Haram and ISIS and stop pretending that the perpetrators are not Muslims 
Good job David.
I upvote any news story that highlights the inherent violence of islam, especially ones that highlight those fighters being killed. 
&gt;The Cameroon army claimed Wednesday to have dealt a major blow to Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamists, killing around 100 fighters

&gt;At least six people died in the attacks

Right on, Boko Haram fighters aren't fucking people. 
Misread this as Cameron army....
misread the headline as Cameron, and briefly thought that I needed to re-evaluate that cunt.
More like "Cameroon and Chad chipped in and paid a South African PMC to go in and kill a few and Cameroon takes credit for it, this time." 
I'm so American, I read "Cameroon" and first thought was:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eBjVUbFDik


Bad day to be Boko-boy, I guess
Can't believe I am saying this- but keep going, Cameroon. 
More like Bozo Haram! Am I right guys?

Guys?
Jesus fucking Christ, what a stupid thread.

My working theory is that /r/worldnews is comprised of 90% of psyops agents and 10% neo-nazis. When a thread does not involve refugees, muslims, Russia, Israel, pollution in China, or the I.S., everyone just screws around because they're bored.
100 is too convenient a number. Something doesn't feel right 
Go James Cameron!

oh wait.
... destroys 1500 Toyota pickups, captures 11000 AK47s and confiscates 1 BILLION DOLLARS 
Alrighty, time to read comments to tell me why this isn't really a good thing
I like that phrase: 'clean up operation'. Translation: We wiped up some shit.
I'm a little confused about who is the bad guy these days.

vietnamwar.jpg
I read "kangaroo army" and then wondered what so many kangaroos do in Africa (besides freeing hostages, obviously)...
I didn't know what was Cameroon until now. Good job!

We did it reddit!
But then, since it was Cameroon, those 900 hostages were promptly raped by the army that "rescued" them.
For the lazy wondering what the 'targets' are:

&gt;500 oil tanks... 26 command-centers, 35 depots, 28 fortified sites, 3 training camps, 8 explosive factories and 86 heavy-weapon stores for the ISIS were destroyed.
Russia racking up some nice XP, clearly going for the platinum trophy.
I get vietnam deja-vu... welcome to 2015 where the body count is made up and doesn't matter in the end
Perhaps this isn't the right place for this question, but the math never seems to add up. 

How is ISIS able to be so strong?  They are complete assholes.  No one likes them.  Everyone views them as the definition of evil and everyone realizes they are bad for society.  Muslims know that they are following/enforcing an extreme interpretation of Islam.... 


All of this leads me to believe that their numbers would dwindle faster than they can replenish them.  I just don't see how anyone would join them.  What am I missing here?  Are they forcing people into their ranks?  Are there more extreme Muslims in the world than we thought? 

If no country supports them, how are they getting weapons and supplies?  I know they were selling oil on the black market, but they can't sell *that* much can they? 
yo, but how many twitter accounts dey get?
All we hear over and over are these huge reports of this many ISIS targets blown up, this many militants taken out, this many dozen more bombs dropped. Is it any of this actually making a difference? You can bomb an enemy forever - the US has been trying it since WWII - but you cannot win a war just by blowing up targets from the air. You need actual competent ground forces or ground allies to defeat ISIS. Are they making gains right now? Or is all of this fluff?
What I find ironic with the Isis situation is that they might unite the world, against them that is. Because now both Russia and the US are bombing the same targets for once.
So when they are Russian bombs no one cares about civilian casualties? 
dude I'm so glad all the world powers are coming together finally to be like --- 

wipe them out.... all of them.
I wonder how many of those targets were actually destroyed
Are they actually valuable targets or empty buildings? 
France's retaliatory attacks ended up leveling buildings that ISIS abandoned, no one was home. They move around and hide very effectively, and they use civilian heavy areas to hide in. We can bomb away to our heart's content but it's not making much overall progress. 

If the Russians are counting rocks that were somehow loyal to ISIS as targets... or blowing up targets too late, it doesn't make much difference. 
If this was a story about the US bombing all you hear about is how many civilian casualties there were. 
Isis can't stay in the game for long at this rate. 
Why aren't there any [Daeshcam](https://www.get-digital.dk/web/getdigital/gfx/products/__generated__resized/1100x1100/Aufkleber_Trollface.jpg) videos of the Russian cruise missiles hitting targets? :(
Are they actual ISIS targets this time, or "ISIS" targets (aka FSA)?
This source again.  This site is bunk as fuck people. 
Could we stop posting articles from this site? No other outlets ever corroborate on their stories
Bouncing rubble around.
Did Russia change their strategy?

Were they not targeting the FSA prior to Friday?
The US has been bombing ISIS in Syria for two years, so what's our score?
How does the Russian Air Force identify an ISIS target?

If they just dropped a bomb on it, it's ISIS.
they attacked too early. double XP weekend started today in COD-BOPS3. but really good for them. 
I'll believe it when I hear it from other news sources that are not Russian state agencies
Awesome.. but in fairness, if Russia had a free press this also would be the time that the unavoidable civilian causality stories would come out. That is why the US can't roll like this 
May God have mercy on the innocent. 
All in the name to help Assad 
"ISIS" targets.
Why is it that I don't believe a word of that?
How can you possibly be at war with US,Russia,France,UK and expect to come out on top?
enjoy your armageddon isis
So is terrorism over? Did the Russians end it?
good, fuck isis.
Say what you want to about Russian lack of morality, when it comes time in war they get shit done.
Suuuuuuure.
These claims were already hilarious before the Paris attack, now even Russian TV anchors visibly struggle not to laugh.
Probably bullshit.
Actual ISIS this time or "Fuck it, they're all brown blow 'em up and say we're bombing ISIS" like they've been doing?
TIL, every thing destroyed by Russian air force appears to be an ISIS target.
Jesus people, dont you realize this doesn't mean shit.  We were fighting people in the jungles of Vietnam and bombings them relentlessly and I ask how that turned out.  Bodycount doesnt mean shit when your rotating your Army and replenishing with fresh bodies.   Certainly there is a statistic chance ISIS is destroyed but dont be fool, theres a shit ton of work before we start cracking open beers.  Bomb these clever bastards all you want, we'll have to kill em' off one by one in the streets.  We pretty much need to walk a police call across that region. 
They're not fucking around, are they? 

It sucks that they don't like us. I don't think we've every had this much military respect for another super power. lol.
Doubts about US bombing ISIS: here's a tin foil hat

Doubts about Russia bombing ISIS: serious thinker
Where is Russia getting all the intelligence for target locations? Shouldn't the coalition have already destroyed a lot of this?
How do we know this information is reliable?
How many innocent people killed ?
Russia sure is Putin the hurt on those fools 
Am I the only one that is concerned about the gameifcation of a very real conflict? 
Isn't this like wiping the tip of a marker? They should go after the money
Do they do a physical count on the bodies?
Now start doing something in regards to where they get their financing.  Freeze assets, block transfers, etc.
So that's like what? 1,000 more terrorists created? 
By ISIS, they are talking about the rebels (mercenaries) they have been fighting the entire time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZDyr2LkdI
I wouldn't trust this source. Related article: "ISIS withdraws from Syria to Iraq". What?
It's a bit more complicated of a claim than that.

Putin is allied with president Bashar Al-Assad.  The regime all the rebels want to remove.  

SOME of those are ISIS.  You'd have to get a bit philosophical to suppose whether ALL the rebel factions want to install an oppressive theocracy.  Or whether Putin's motives are to prevent an "Islamic State" caliphate as opposed to just protecting their own interests.

But if you don't think Putin's motives are "pure", then the "ISIS targets we destroyed" are probably mostly rebels who just oppose Assad's government.  

"Innocent victim" is a difficult thing to assess but they may have no association to ISIS or the bombing of the Russian airliner.


Hopefully Im not too late to have this answered. 



Is ISIS reeling now? Is the retribution from Russia/US/allies having a serious effect on ISIS? Did they anticipate an enormous backlash after the attacks on Friday? Is it possible that this marks the beginning of the end of ISIS's large influence on the middle east and the world as a whole? Is it even possible to completely defeat ISIS?
Now that a Chinese prisoner had been executed I hope China will join in and every country involved can go back and forth setting new records for most daesh targets destroyed in 48 hours. Come on China you can do atleast 600 I'm sure. Join the daeshbag challenge! 
A bit off topic, but can something like blowing up 500 oil tanks, etc have a significant effect on the region's environment? Said differently, will Syria be dealing with the consequences of this generations from now?
Good, maybe they will leave the Ukraine alone for a few minutes. 
AMEN
Serious question. With all this talk of "another extremist group will pop back up" or "we can't control them long term", other than ethical reasons, why can't we just walk in there and claim Syria and bordering countries and turn them into US (or other country) sovereign states? 
You'll see DAESH ramp up the videos about attacks as their ability to wage terror is greatly diminished. But what would really demoralize them is show videos of THEIR troops killed and perhaps defiling their bodies as to prevent entry into heaven (run over by a tank; then pour pig guts over the remains)...see how THEY like it...
Russia Putin the smack down on ISIS
Does it bother anybody else that if they know where these places are, why do they wait until after an attack happens?
They must be rolling sixes.
How many countries have to be a part of this before it's ok to call it World War 3?
ISIS can never be victorious without air superiority. They have to lose.
We need to start taking out their financers. Funding terrorism should get a drone up your ass.
Unlike what some of other commentators are saying here, we actually do have substantive proof that bombing is working. How do we know? Because the military families of ISIS leadership are being moved from Raqqa to Mosul for their safety. The real question is how much is ISIS able to make up for the losses with new recruits and foreign capital pouring in. With Russia and Iran increasing their commitment to Syria you can be certain that the Gulf States have increased their funding for rebel groups. What percentage of that is going to ISIS vs moderate rebels is nearly impossible to say but I would seriously hope that in the aftermath of these recent terrorists attacks that Gulf money is being shifted from the former to the latter.
its not enough. i want more.
It's remarkable what you can accomplish with a wanton disregard for collateral damage. :)
Putin don't play 
What is the definition of a "target"?
What's the US's take on this whole ordeal as of right now?  I read Obama said our strategy on ISIS hasn't changed...but what was the strategy he spoke of?
IMO it's because Russia has a much looser set of rules of engagement. I doubt it's desire, my hunch it tolerance of civilian deaths. While there is limited tolerance for Americans, the Russians DGAF.
Vladimir really Putin it on them
More likely 300 non-ISIS and 55 ISIS.
Does that mean those millions of refugee can return back to their country?
Lol of course Assad would say that shit.
I'm surprised at the sheer number of oil infrastructure targets there are available to be bombed at this point in the war. I guess the Syrians themselves have held back from attacking them because they hoped to recapture it whole someday. 

The fact that the Russians don't seem to care about this makes me wonder about their end-game. 
Russia is Putin an end to ISIS.
I'm not saying that abna24 (the site where this comes from) is some sort of propoganda or something, but they seem to post articles with absolutely zero percent proof. It's most likely just a bunch of bullshit and thus isn't mentioned anywhere else.
who in the world is funding this evil organization that it has 500 oil tanks, 8 explosive factories, 26 command centers..etc
some one who seriously focuses on wiping major terrorist out is lonesome Russia. What US and its European friends can't do in months is done by Russia in matter of few days. Kudos to Putin and kudos to his jets! 

P.S I am not Russian
Good news is that DAESH succeeds in allying nearly everybody against them.

Bad news is that it is exactly what they want, so that Muslim world rises against this "coalition".

The key is in Muslims hands, guys should me more proactive.

Who is killing who in Syria? Russia is killing ISIS soldiers, but ISIS is funded via the US by Saudi Arabia. Now France is supposedly bombing ISIS too. Are they really bombing ISIS targets or just saying that they are and instead actually bombing Syrian government targets. Seriously what the hell is going on there? It sounds like an absolute mess. I just hope Russia can help defend their ally from a Western/Saudi/Israeli funded proxy war and restore order and freedom for the Syrian people. Viva Russia!
Gotta call bullshit on this as a source. Here's a quote from [another article](http://en.abna24.com/service/grand-ayatollahs/archive/2015/11/19/720583/story.html) from the same site:

&gt; Ayatollah Hossein Nouri Hamedani said on Thursday that the recent terrorist operation in Paris has justified new waves of Islamophobia to expel Muslims and set ablaze the holy Quran. 

&gt; The role of the Zionist regime in Paris incident is very strong, he said, adding that enemies are vigilant and spare no efforts to mastermind plots.

So... skeptical, to say the least.

Putin is making a movie called "Terms of Enrampagement."  (It's a working title.)
Only one small problem with this ...  

**Ahlul Bayt "News" Agency**

You honestly think that these ass-lifters are going to tell the truth?  This "news" agency is in bed with the Iran regime.  
We're these ISIS targets or was Russia bombing the Free Syria Army to help out their buddy Assad... again.
I don't buy for a single second that all of those targets were ISIS. Plus, we know that the protocol Russia uses to select targets is... lax.
Took way too fucking long for any nation to respond. Fuck all of us.
So Russia finally says "Fuck it, Kill'em all!" And destroys all these targets in a matter of days. Which leads one to believe that we "The usa" likely knew about all these targets as well. Because Russia isn't allowed to know more than us!..So why has the USA been playing patty cake with these ISIS goat fucking assholes this whole time? We should of gone in there and wiped these fuckers out before they even began uploading their first beheading video! I'm disappointed with the USA. But is this also an attempt for Putin to showcase his own military might and let everyone else they are fully capable of hanging with any other super power?..
So, how many civilians killed? You realized that they will never say it..officially..while in the west we would be slapped in the face for killing one innocent, Russia and soon china can do it, and nobody will complain.
Maybe pissing off Russia wasn't the best idea, haha. Suck it ISIS!
Soldiers fighting for our freedom so we can continue to play our video games... 
oil fields still untouched?
Something something, Daesh.
Hey guys, consider the source of the news. Just sayin', if the numbers of targets borders on ... medieval, it's probably inflated.
Russia trying to get in on that double XP weekend
Not to pour on parade or something, but claim's a claim.

Also

&gt; “The Russian air force, in cooperation with the Syrian air force, carried out 186 sorties against ISIS sites in Syria,” Syria news agency reported.

If "sorties" means what i think it means, i call utter bullshit on original claim.
Jokes on you, Russia.  ISIS went to Europe.
I am wondering how many prisoners being held in ISIS compounds were killed in these bombings.
Why is this stupid propaganda getting voted up so high on reddit?

Fucking a people, the first 5 words of the article are "Russia’s Armed forces staff said ..."
I find it ironic that many American conservatives would have supported us taking military action against Bashar al-Assad's regime just a few years ago--guy used chemical weapons on his own people, he's like Saddam Hussein 2.0. But now everyone seems to support going to war against ISIS, which has practically replaced the Arab Spring rebellion against Assad.
The source is a site that makes Fox news look respectable, so whilst Russia may have hit some targets in Syria, take any details with a (heavy) pinch of salt

From the website itself:

"The followers of Ahlolbayt (as) and their holy Imams alike have been oppressed throughout the history from the dark era of Umayyad caliphs up to the age of Abbasids, and from Abbasids to middle ages, and afterward up to the present time. The roots of this oppression and even its further intensification may be sought in the ignorance of Shiite Muslims about each other and unawareness of global communities of such oppressions against Shiites. A large portion of mass media and communication tools is in the hands of rolers and arrogant powers who are fighting in the opposing front against pure Mohammedan Islam. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, too, despite existence of many news agencies, newspapers and websites, there was always a tangible necessity for a specialized news agency to work specifically for broadcasting the news of Shiah world and followers of Ahlolbayt worldwide. Authorities of the Ahlolbayt World Assembly during the tenure of present Secretary General Hujjatol-Islam Mohammad Hasan Akhtari well recognized the sensitivity of the condition. To fill the gap, they embarked on launching a three-language electronic news agency, which was then gradually and logically developed. By the grace of Almighty Allah and blessings of holy Ahlolbayt (as), it is now turned into an active seven-language news agency with competent editorial staff in Iran and some other countries."

[deleted]
Before we get too excited, it's important to note that Russia had already eclipsed the US total of independently reported civilian casualties in just two months *before* this latest campaign.

The Russians are playing this no-rules style, which means chances are, they are blowing up a lot of innocent people in the process.
THANK YOU, PUTIN!!!!
The bear is angry.  Hope the Pentagon appreciates the assist.
Define ISIS targets. Like the ones in Aleppo and Idleb that are actually FSA and SDF?
...
how many are left?
Nice
"ISIS targets"

Ahh well. I'm happy either way.
Fuck yea
Another abna submission...
Or as the rest of world calls the supposed "ISIS" targets: Syrian rebels. 
Hmmm looks like all the ALLIES are back together.
I wonder how many are civilians which will bite us in thd ass later 
According to a report from a local the Russian strikes are a lot more indiscriminate and they end up taking our a lot of civilians as well.
VAC
I think my main problem with this whole thing is I'd like to so a muslim country taking the lead on dealing Islamic fundamentalists. Is that too naive a viewpoint? I'd like to  hear a strong islamic voice/power providing the main means of dealing with this, not "the west". Also Russian media coverage is often extremely bias towards Russia...
MULTI-KILL

There's two kinds of people in this world: Those who get stomped on and those who do the stomping-Jesus
How many civilians killed?
Gloves are coming off. Fuck ISIS.
Bruh...who wants to team up all Team America style and get this money. 
Let's all hope these targets are Isis an not the Syrian resistance. If those bombs are not falling on top of Assad palace, this is bad news.
so.... how many ISIS targets are there to go?

is war over now?
How many Isis targets are there?
Did we win the war on terror?
At the mean time, 400 more Black Water employees are leaving Minnesota and heading to Syria.
Isis fucked up real bad
ISIS seems to have officially pissed the world off in a very, 'OK you're done you fucking piss ants' sorta way.
I have a feeling they [survived..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0bl_Nle3Ko)
I could see headlines like this on the front page for a year and never tire of it
Good. Fuck those Fucks
It feels wrong and strange to say that... but this news made me really happy.
If it wasn't obvious that the US never wanted to eliminate ISIS to begin with, it should be now after watching the Russians do more in 2 months than we've done in an entire year.

Russia wants to keep Assad in power.  The US wants a reason to engage in a ground war in Syria, dismantle the Assad regime, and replace it with a US (read: Israel) friendly government so the international bankers can swing in and crush the country in debt so Syria can "rebuild".  Iran will be next.
So this supposed journalist forgot to proof read
Why shouldnt everyone just bomb their oil fields. Take away their income. 
proof or it didn't happen
Для Родины!
Все ваши базы принадлежат нам
Go Russia!?...
Thanks, Putin.
If ISIS operate using some kind of dark ages philosophy, doesn't destroying all their modern technology play into their hands to a certain respect? 
I can imagine Putin furiously spamming a drop warhead button to death metal
724,532 to go.
The biggest shock in this is that america isn't attacking russia yet.
Good!
Wow, U.S.A., you are slacking. Russia, good job. Syrian Air Force, good job as well. We shouldn't have any sympathy against those terrorists.
All these comments relating ISIS to vietnam, Prepare yourself for the ISIS TET offensive.
Russia! Russia! Russia!
So are they gone yet?
Fuck yeah Russia. Send them to hell. 
 The Whack-a-Mole champions of the world! Bonus points for trying!
It feels weird to be on the same side with Russia and military action but I'm fine with this.
russias so great, they take the heat off america and make america look good (especially after the hospital bombing) by being so indiscriminate themselves

AND they do things that america cant bring itself to do, like put assad in power and create actual STABILITY in that country

russia is saving america from itself
Wait, Russians attacking oil? After supporting Assad and ISIS through purchasing their oil, and Russian banks constantly handing them business for the last 5 years? The world has truly turned upside down.
And how many innocent people died amongst that?
That doesn't sound like too high a number for anybody?  What are these oil sites?  The article doesn't really explain.   This seems like the type of thing where in Vietnam the U.S. would count  the number of dead enemy combatants to make it seem that we were winning.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_count#Vietnam_War

Here's a quote from the OP's article:

&gt;&gt;Russia’s Armed forces staff said Wednesday that Russian air force carried out air raids against oil sites for ISIS terrorist organization, destroying 500 oil tanks that were smuggling oil from Syria to Iraq.

Are 500 oil tanks a large amount?  How much is moved from Syria to Iraq in a normal 48-hour period?
How do we know it's actually ISIS? Has the US military or any other force other than Syria or Russia confirmed the accuracy of this? 
Even his parents call him pentakill. Until now that is
Can someone explain to the lay person how much damage this really is? The numbers seem great but in terms of proportion of Daesh's entire infrastructure how bad is this for them?
Isis can't stay in the game for long at this rate. 
wow, they ain't fucking around. 

I haven't really been following this, ( so please take my next comments with a grain of salt) i think isis has become a problem for the syrian dictator so he told russia to eliminate them. ( thats just my thought anyway, now everyone is banding together)
ISIS started the game in Hard mode.  This is first wave.
Russia's OP
Well at least someone is doing something.
Good riddance
I hope civilians are not involved, it might back fire to the cause if they will join the other side because of civilian casualties,...
Send an early Kurd rush. 
...How many targets are there???
I know Russia has its own motives but I gotta give it to them.. they sure know how to get things done and don't get caught between political and bureaucratic bullshit. 
youre telling me all these years they couldve done that but just didnt?

Putin the smack down.
Save some for France.
Yay! Putin bringing the pain :)
Good, Fuck em up Putin
Don't mess with Russia
So what actually have the US been doing all this time if there´s still so many targets left for Russia? Even if you pretend like Russia is lying about half of their numbers, it´s still way more impressive than what the US Coalition have been pulling. 

Can someone explain?
"Who is this guy "collateral damage" you keep talking about, and what is he doing on my bombing range?"

-Russians in Syria
Serious question: How are these things confirmed? I always wondered how our intelligence agencies are able to confirm when we kill high operative targets.
I made a few replies to this nature, but I'll make a top-level one too since so many people seem to be confused.

They killed the leader of ISIS's Libyan operations, not the leader of all of ISIS who happened to be in Libya. 

It's a victory, but not a huge one, since the Libya ISIS are pretty much just guys who were already in Libya that were like "hey can we join y'all?". Still, fuck this guy, glad he's dead.
I've played enough shadow of mordor to know this doesn't really solve the problem. 
maybe 100 years from now we will kill an isis leader and the 2nd in command will go nah no thanks im good and we can all go home
I like to believe that when the pilots got home they ate french fries. 
Someone made a phone call after the Paris attack and said, "Hey, are we tracking any high-value ISIS targets? If so, feel free to go ahead and take em out now."
gone is old leader say hi to new leader
Good, fuck him.
Thanks.

Sincerely, someone living in Paris.
Thanks, Obama. 

(a Frenchman). 

no sarcasm.
THE leader of ISIS, or A leader in ISIS? 
Kk I'm not parked far text when u leave counter and get you in same spot

Edit: she made it to the car. Hahaha. I have no idea how this happened by I'm dying of laughter right now

Edit 2: no acid but herb yes. 
Again?

Seems like we're shooting him every other week.
Good job U.S.
To be honest though, someone has to do something about ISIS basically committing mass genocide in the middle east.
Here's the thing, if the US doesn't go into to fight ISIS, everyone bitches and says they don't care blah blah. If the US does go in to fight ISIS everyone says they have no right to be there blah blah. Its a lose lose situation for the US.
Here are the controlling factors.
There actually is a serious need for some intervention in the middle east.

1. Literally everyone hates ISIS
2. BUT Everyone is using ISIS as a tool, just like they always do in wars (WWI, WWII etc). Russia is using the ISIS excuse to support Assad, the US to support Rebels, etc.
3. All these countries need to stop trying to fight proxy wars and other bullshit and just take out ISIS, they could do it relatively easily in fact.
4. Every country is scared to act, because media and civilians get on their case if they do, and ISIS will target them more if they do
5. Every country is scared to not act, as people are dying, and media and civilians get on their case if they dont do anything. We need to decide. Do we support the US going in there?
6. Citizens will die if the US intervenes more
7. WAY more citizens will die if they dont
8. A lot of the reason the US is going there is for some alternative motive
9. But why the hell would it be worth their time if they dont get some benefit?
10. We are not going to get countries to band together to fight ISIS, so there will always be some heat, even on those opposing them
Isn't this a kind of Hydra-situation: cut off one head, two come back in its place?
Will the real ISIS leader please stand up
Get absolutely fucked
I'm trying not to jump on the "Eye for an eye" argument, but let me just say "Fuck this piece of shit."

May he wind up tied to a chair watching episodes of "NCIS LA" for eternity.
It's a strange coincidince that 14 hours before this article was posted, someone posted that [same](https://www.reddit.com/r/aviation/comments/3sqpha/f15s/) picture in /r/avation 


Let's remember that France was part of a coalition that conducted 5,900 airstrikes on Gaddafi's army. When ISIS took control of parts of Libya, they have not conducted 1 airstrike against them. The coalition yet again created a failed state by overthrowing a dictator that kept all the terrorists out.
Islamic extremist view the West's success with drones and airstrikes in the same way the west views terrorists success with terror attacks. 
Have Ben Carson's sources confirmed it?
And 10 minutes later there is another "leader".
I want to upvote but I also want to downvote for the extrmely misleading title. 
This guy seems to die 5 times a month
Killing their leaders is good, but we really need to kill their logistics people too.
I hope he died a slow, painful death. That dickhead
Good. Hope the bastard is getting raped in hell
Didn't they kill him like 36 hours ago? Or is this a higher ranked guy.
Rot in hell, you fucking son of a bitch.
One less drop in the bucket
Wait... we're still using F-15s? Those have been flying around since the 70s!
Thanks.

Sincerely, someone living in Paris.
How many leaders does ISIS fucking have? 
...again

Don't they kill some leader or another every week it seems like?
[deleted]
Every single member of ISIS should die. 
A leader will fall and a new one will take his place. 
It's a start..now lets finish the job
http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/11/14/after-paris-time-to-roll-on-raqqa-the-isis-capital.html
funny thing about leaders.  they keep happening.

Instead of focusing on the leaders, maybe they should wipe out the followers.  
Haven't we done this a few times apparently?
Does ISIS have a "leader"? If I were a sociopathic religious zealot building a terror organization I'd go with a decentralized power structure so no one can take the cut-the-head-off-the-dragon approach.
Again?
Does anyone else find it a bit odd that the day after Paris the U.S all of sudden kill the leader of the group that carried it out? Makes me wonder if they knew his location and could have pulled the trigger before or maybe its just a massive coincidence?
This is like pissing into an hive of ants, nothing happens except a little stir.

We need a full co-operation between EU, Nato, UN, USA and Russia. Atleast.

To go there amass and wipe them out. But thats not going to happen when the big nations are all heads up their asses with hate and pride.
So this is what leader number 3 or 4 that we have killed now? All they do is replace one with a new one when one is lost. 
How many leaders do these fuckers have?? Every week it seems like I see a post on the front page with the same damn title. 
Suck a dick in hell you bastard
I absolutely hate that I see a headline about someone being killed and I think 'good.'

But good.  
Now let's hope they kill the rest of those fucking cunts. Fuck ISIS and the wake of death they leave behind. 
And now a younger more radical leader will take his place. 
Well that was fast.
Hopefully the next revenge attack by ISIS/Daesh will be stopped before they can carry it out.  Sad to see what happened to Paris, but I think ISIS picked Paris because its easy for terrorist to blend in.
theres always another head to slice
The leader of all of ISIS or just the leader of ISIS in Syria? 
Leader #12634859 please step up and replace previous leader 
Fuck him and all the members of ISIS. They all deserve to die. Get that shit off the planet.
Hell yeah.
Good hopefully the rest of IS are sure to follow.
Cut off one head, two more will take its place.
Good. Let's get the rest of them.
I wonder if we started jailing these guys instead of killing them, if that would be more effective? (Genuinely asking)
you say IS now, "ISIS" is outdated
Good
Serious question: does no one else think its strange that we kill this guy less than 24 hours after the Paris attack? Is it crazy to think that we might have known where this guy was well before then? 
Fuck ISIS
Take them alive and put them in stocks in Paris. They deserve the humiliation.
Fucked him right in the pussy
Good. They're fucking monsters and they deserve to die.
normally i wouldn't be happy if someone died, but i fucking hate terrorists. so i am happy now. i hope isis will taste some more american "freedom"
Next.
Join ISIS! plenty of opportunities for promotion!

/s
Good. Fuck that fuck.
phew, NOW ISIL is contained. 
serious question: how many is that now? leader number 53?
And yet, nothing changes.
The deaths of ISIS leaders are like new cancer cures or sex propositions  to my gf: Twice a week and useless.
What gets me is that apparently, ISIS has it's own hotel, where single Jiahdis can relax by the pool, or have a sampling of the in house concubines. Why hasn't this place been raided or just converted to ashes?
Good, kill ALL of the goddamn murdering  motherfuckers!!
"The strike hit Wisam al Zubaidi, a.k.a. Abu Nabil al Anbarian, an Iraqi national who once led al Qaeda operations in part of Iraq.At some point after that, he moved to eastern Libya to lead ISIS operations there."

Wow, he's one tough motherfucker.  Shook it off and kept going.
'Leader' lol. When one dies, five take his place.
God damn how many fucking names did this guy have? 
Thanks.

Sincerely, someone living in Paris.

i am interested to know why it takes 24 hours to find one person, but takes 10 freakin years and trillions of taxpayers dollars later to find a 6ft someone with a serious diabetes problem?
Let's hope it makes a difference
If ISIS is such a problem, maybe we should stop arming them. Just sayin... wars always have the same guys profiteering from arming both sides... maybe instead of going after arbitrary figureheads in the middle east, we go after the people responsible for creating war in the first place... No?
I never wished someone death or something bad. But these fuckers need to be wiped out from the face of the earth.

so who is the new leader? Auk-muh-ahmid?
Enjoy your non-existent virgins, corpse
so many idiots in this thread, that is what scares me the most, how stupid and emotional people can be. 
I dont care how we kill these bastards. I have had ENOUGH of these pieces of useless shit, running around murdering innocent people. If it means monitering the WHOLE muslim community, so be it. These people are obviously coming from SOMETHING islamic, so they need to be watched for now on. Idc whose rights are whose. Half of these damn people are illegally getting over our border. we are doing nothing about it. After this Paris attack, enough is enough. I can't wait for the day when i can watch these terrorists burn and suffer in hell. Good riddens, shitbags.
Good. 
*plays "america, fuck yeah" at the highest volume*
The US making an impact the last few days. Fuck Yeah!
I think the past 15 years has shown us that killing the leader of any terrorist organization doesn't do jack shit
Cut the snakes head another grows. Cut its finances that's what I want to see
In killing the leaders of a movement, we cause would be future leaders to weigh heavily the cost to benefit of their own advancement in the organization.
Too bad the US allowed ISIS to take over Libya in the first place. Went from the richest nation in Africa back to one of the most destitute. So they killed one person; someone will take his place.
U.S. Is all "so I heard you picked a fight with my brother....."
We aren't fucking around anymore, bitches.
congrats. 10 more will spring up
Good, fuck isis and the *radical* Islam's. Much love to my peaceful Muslims around the world from Canada. 
Can't wait to hear weekly about all the seconds in command we will kill between now and the election, with no mention of any of the collateral damage each time. 
Well, the comments and this thread are just a bowl shit, aren't they? What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
I wish hell was real, too bad they won't burn in anything 
Fuck Yea!
Not to be THAT guy but just like every other news from the middle east there's literally  viable ways to confirm this is true, same with jihadi john and other guys from isis.



From what we know the army could be saying this just like everything else to continue getting support
Humans make me sad
"We got your back France"
Allaaaahu Akbaaaaaarrr mother f****r
One less evil. Good riddance 
No mercy on these guys.

Avoid civilian casualties and beyond that, bomb every last one of them.
It should be standard practice, that when we kill an extremist, to wrap them in bacon and embalm them with bacon grease. Fuck your afterlife fantasies.
It'd be nice if all of France's allies were to combine efforts to bumfuck those dipshits.
I'm wondering what the collateral damage from an airstrike like this is. How many people who were neutral to this mans ideas were killed as well. Many of these people are only one family members death away from becoming radicals themselves. I think I would become very biased against anyone who bombed any of my family members, regardless of their activity. After decades of instability, violence, and propaganda thrown at you one can only assume that the easy step to revenge would be to join ISIS ...

I seriously wonder how much collateral damage from these strikes is caused. Not just because of immediate deaths, but from people finally having enough and turning against what seems to them to be the enemy. Living in constant fear of drone strikes and bombings must take its toll on the everyday person. 

Look how quick we are to be emotionally affected by something like 9/11 and now the attacks recently in France! Now imagine this being the everyday reality with a big western stamp on the cause of suffering and fear.

This is a bit of a rant and will probably get buried but I had to get it off my chest. 
MURICA
I like to believe it was a woman who killed him. ISIS believes that if you are killed by a woman you don't go to heaven and as a result are afraid of female soldiers.
[deleted]
after we kill ISIS, how do we kill the next group that inevitably takes its place, out of the carnage/instability we will leave in the middle-east

does anyone realize this cycle is stupid, and we need to detach engagement from the middle-east most of all

if only we can go back in time, to 9/11, and slap some sense into the people who just had to "liberate" the arabs, and save them from the other guy, the "extremist" guy who was the "REAL" problem (used to be al qaeda, now its ISIS)
'Murica
good riddance
This is meaningless. The only thing this horrible people have learnt is that there's a structure in place to nurture a replacement pretty much as soon as a head rises. 

To get rid of ISIS, we'd need to either get rid of the house of Saud and the Turk intel and training, or this is never going to end. 


Good riddance. Go 'Merica!
Kill 'em all, boys.  Kill 'em all.
Quick turnaround time. 
Conflict will always be unavoidable because of human desire. Its sad really. This is the way that people have always been...
You do know another dude will climb the ladder and man the ship...
How many leaders does ISIS have? 
I don't know why the media is so late with this. I heard about this yesterday as I heard about the attacks in Paris. Vice News I believe was the first to report it.
How many of these guys do we have to kill until the violence stops? Seems like senior leaders of the taliban, al queda, and isil have been getting killed nonstop the last 15 years, but we're still fighting. This is like a never ending game of whack-a-mole.
So they've list Al-Hawl, Sinjar, and several towns in the past 2 days and now this, I hope they realise thinks are just going to get worse for Daesh 
Thought at first this meant the leader of ISIS (entirely) was in Libya, and they killed him.

Still good news though.
FUCK YEAH
Awesome, was getting so tired of all this terrorism.
That was fast.
the fuck took so long
So what? These terrorist organizations are like hydras: you cut one head off, three more pop up in it's place.
One by one they'll fall, until there are none left at all!
Does this mean that they might plan another terrorist attack somewhere in Europe or anywhere else because of these killings? Seems scary that everything we do to destroy them might make them attack even more.
Now 2 more will fill his shoes. . . 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-uUZCgDMoxY
Good. Burn them from the earth, and nothing of value will be lost.
This is wonderful news but it's a shame that where one 'leader' dies, there's 50 more people to take his place. =(
This Rand Paul guy is such a dummy /s
WOOHOO we did it folks, let the good times begin
[FUCK YEAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhnUgAaea4M)
Okay, maybe this is just how I would operate an organization like this, but how do we know they're the real leaders? I have *no* idea how any of these raids and leadership takeouts work, but I know I would have a figurehead to take the fall as the leader keeping the real leader(s) in the shadows, and out of the crosshairs.

Which leader is this one? The 35th or the 56th?
Feel like we kill the leader of ISIS every week.  Also confusing title.
Good news, even if these leaders are probably easily replaced. I would imagine ISIS and other terrorist groups would take a bigger hit if the US went after the folks funding them.
The article says this attack has nothing to do with what happened in Paris. Bullshit...this just proves they know where the enemy is at all times. They just choose when it's the right time to eliminate them.
Well, that was quick. I wonder if the same would had happened if Bin Laden had attacked London or something.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkuHU0zsh6w

hrm...this was posted in March
Fuck em up boys!
Considering the recent attacks in France, possibly sparked by the killing of "Jihad John", I fear the repercussions of this.
Whether this is linked to what happened in Paris or not...sweet mother-fracking vengeance.
So was the leader of ISIS killed in Libya or was the leader of ISIS in Libya killed?
Let's go! Fuck the radical shitsacks. I say we go in 2002 style with France.

bout damn time, too bad there will be 3 more to take his place.
The group is full of such deranged fuckheads that I'd be wary of attributing "leadership" or any other status to the cunts we manage to kill. Nice kill, like any other animal pest.
I didn't know the US was still flying military planes over Libya...thought they stopped that after Gaddafi.
I guess it's okay.
We didnt but I mean even if we killed al-baghdadi it wouldn't do anything to stop them. They are an ideology and a standard government or military
lol great, fuck you, ya giant motherfucker! 
And I'm sure the leader has already been replaced 
This seems a bit too convinient...
Not related my ass 
It seems sort of irrelevant to specify that he's the leader as opposed to just an operative. They'll just replace him with a carbon copy, they've likely already done so, and it's as if nothing is changed but their defensive strategy. 
Can any one explain why there seems to be so many "senior officials" who are not allowed to speak publicly whom speaks to the press and requests anonymity?
meh next leader will come in
going after ISIS is important. its pointless though unless you can give sunni muslims in Iraq and Syria a state.

they are more or less shut out of the political process in both nations, which helps the radical factions gain popularity.

without giving the young people hope of a better life through civilian means, the darker path will have its appeal.

the reconstruction of Iraq was a failure, and ISIS genesis can be traced directly to it.
Can someone say "power vacuum?"
How are ISIS so bad at hiding their leaders?

If they killed a couple of our generals every week, questions would be asked about how our generals were so vulnerable!
Great news, but they just keep popping up.
That afterburner looks sexy as fuck.
Jihadi John wasn't the leader of ISIS, it's a guy called Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who as far as we know is still alive.
4chan would just say.. Mooooaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrr.........Or SumTing
again? didn't they kill him like 1 month ago?
Does this seem incredibly convenient in its timing to anyone else? 
ISIS in Libya? Isn't that a misnomer? (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria)

...I really wish everyone would stop using ISIS and refer to them in the more derogatory form, *Daesh*
Title fail: US kills leader of Libyan ISIS
Hopefully it doesn't grow back two heads.
How do we really know this is true.  Friday Obama dismisses ISIS, then Paris happens, Now we kill the leader of ISIS somewhere in Lybia.
convenient timing 
Again? Shit dude, this guy is reported dead every few months. He's like the Morgan Freeman of jihad.
TLDR:

Nestle self audit reveals EVERY company buying seafood from Thailand are complicit in slave labor. 
Nestlé has seafood?
Did literally no one here read the fucking article? This is a result of an internal investigation that they've published after reports of poor working conditions from NGOs and news outlets. They've since concluded the investigation and said that the working conditions of fishermen in Thailand is akin to that of slavery, and it's a problem that affects all businesses who distributes seafood from that area. They've since said that they're instituting new requirements for all suppliers and bringing in outside auditors to make sure those standards are met. Only time will tell what actually happens though.
To everyone who **seriously** wants to attempt to avoid larger brands that do things you don't like, here's the best Imgur picture ever taken!

http://i.imgur.com/k0pv0.jpg (I wonder how many views it has)
If you think cutting Nestle out of your or your pet's diet is enough:

&gt;(...) Some of the litigation cites the reports from the AP, which tracked slave-caught fish to the supply chains of giant food sellers, such as Wal-Mart, Sysco and Kroger, and popular brands of canned pet food, such as Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. It can turn up as calamari at fine restaurants, as imitation crab in a sushi roll or as packages of frozen snapper relabeled with store brands that land on dinner tables. 

The bigger problem is slave labor in Thailand
The comments in this thread are attacking Nestle, which is admittedly not an exemplar when it comes to corporate citizenship. But these attacks are missing a key point, I think: The culture of Thailand that has permitted these sorts of slavery practices for far too long. "The Land of Smiles" has long turned the other way while the poor from its own hinterland provinces have been tricked into slave labor, just like migrants from neighboring Cambodia and Myanmar are similarly exploited today. Thailand is also the home of piratical fishermen who robbed and murdered uncountable Vietnamese boat people in the 70s and 80s, and kidnapped the "prettiest" among the boat people for sex slavery in the brothels of Bangkok.

What can be done about it? Well, Thais revere their king and treat him like a god. Moral leadership from him cannot be underestimated. He and the royal family need to have an open dialogue with their subjects about the stain of slavery in their midst; rather than avert their eyes, Thais need to expose and attack slavery in all its dimensions whenever and wherever they see it. This should have been done decades ago when Thais preyed on Vietnamese boat people. It should be done now when Thais are preying on destitute migrants from neighboring countries.
The fact that industrialized fishing can barely contend with mass slavery under its nose does not portend well for the much larger problem of industrialized fishing as a whole.  Forget slave markets, we're fishing out the oceans.

http://endoftheline.com/
Most misleading title. Should say. "Any company that purchases seafood from Thailand is most likely using slavery and coercion to catch its food."
And they replaced the cocoa butter with vegetable oil and the Mr. Goodbar taste like shart.
The fucked up part is that they are using slave labor for fish used for cat food. I had no idea people are starving and dying so I can feed my two fat lazy asshole loveable fuzzballs. 

More than that, I have been increasingly thinking this about most conveniences many of us use everyday without a second thought. For everyone with a smartphone there is another poor shlub is barely living just to make the thing.
We live in an era where discretely assembled mega-corps owning other mega-corps have been allowed to reach such heights as to be incomprehensible. Now, we have a cookie and baked goods company confessing to using slavery to catch fish, and everyone's reacting like "well, yeah; this was to be expected." We look at that, we say *situation: normal*, and then we wonder how they get away with it.
What do you expect from the company that doesn't believe water is a human right.
&gt;Nestlé​ is not a major purchaser of seafood in Southeast Asia but does some business in Thailand, primarily for its Purina brand Fancy Feast cat food.

Slave labor for cat food what's next?
Why only Nestlé ? Lots of compagny are even more evil than them.
Why don't they sentence themselves to death for these crimes?


Misleading thread is misleading.
Delicious. 
I thought it tasted like coercion.     
Gotta catch that chocolate starfish some way.
TIL Nestle sell seafood also. 

Is there fish in my chocolate milk?
To everyone who **seriously** wants to attempt to avoid larger brands that do things you don't like, here's the best Imgur picture ever taken!

http://i.imgur.com/k0pv0.jpg (I wonder how many views it has)
Nestle sells seafood?
Nestle chocolate covered seafood?
The FLA is mostly funded by the companies which supply to them are treating their workers very badly.
This is actually a good thing. Nestle heard the rumor and did their own investigation. The article also states that Nestle intends to make changes for the better. 
Coercion? In muh free market? Never!
You can really taste the oppression
I sell Nestlé products at the store I work at and there's nothing I can do about it and it eats away at me every day. 

People will vote for politicians that align with their values once a year and vote for slavery every day with their wallets.
Nestle certainly likes playing the big bad company, don't they?
Good! I ain't buying their water.
So you're saying the fish I buy should be a lot cheaper? Great for Nestle, increasing profits in any way possible. However, they haven't been passing this savings on to the consumer. 

Same reason Nike's sweatshops are so upsetting. Why are they so expensive?
Tell us something  we DON'T know. Nestlé,  Danone,  Total, that Portuguese banana  corporation...they're all the same. They all also have very skilled lawyers to protect them and their crimes.
No shit, a Swiss company passing the buck on moral responsibility. These are the same guys who acted surprised when they found out their chocolate products contained slave labour a few years ago (and said they'd improve their standards). 
Nestle seafood together in a sentence makes me think chocolate fish

Ew!
TIL there are people in Thailand who are basically forced into slave labor and paid zero salary.. in order to feed the cats of Westerners.
HIGHLY RELEVANT: great article on this for anyone who wants further info. 

http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/07/27/world/outlaw-ocean-thailand-fishing-sea-slaves-pets.html?referer=
First they get caught having slaves in the Ivory Coast harvesting their cocoa beans... Now they get caught with slaves in Thailand. Seriously, fuck you Nestle. If I'm ever within 50 yards of Paul Bulcke, that jackass is going down. 
I swear these guys are Evil Corp. I try my best to avoid purchasing anything made by these assholes, but they have products everywhere.
Chocolate fish?
I stopped buying nestle products as soon as i heard what the ceo said on water as a commodity. Hershey chocolate chips are just as good!
TIL Hot Pockets, DiGiorno's, Wonka candies are all Nestle products. 
That's a nice misleading title there, OP. 
This is shitty. One thing I happen to like about Nestlé 's chocolate is that it doesn't have PGPR (a sketchy emulsifier)  like ALL of hersheys products 
Just par for the course I suppose. Nestle is a fucking enormous conglomerate.. they and other conglomerates are up to all sorts of no good for the sake of profits. It's sickening.
What actions could/should non politically inclined individuals do to help eliminate slavery in developing countries? 
...Nestle does seafood?
Am I the only one who saw this and thought, "Why the hell is there seafood in my chocolate?"
Hey guys. The free market regulates itself. 
I really don't understand the "Nestle is evil" constant mantra.  The reason why they are frequently in the news with issues in their system is that 1) they are so huge with so many brands and 2) they have a massive, sprawling supply chain with more levels than even they themselves can understand.

Even if you are auditing and re-auditing your suppliers and partners to ensure that they are 99% falling in line with your code of ethics that's still a large number of suppliers and partners that are not, and it just takes one issue to come to light to bring out the hate.  This is an example of that - they are trying to do the right thing here.

The idea that they are all just evil people baffles me.  This is tens of thousands of hard-working people that I have to believe are mostly good, and it's a business model that would be unsustainable if it were OK with making lackluster ethical decisions.
Don't worry! According the libertarians and conservatives, we just need to remove regulations and these corporations will once again start respecting their workers and the environment.
AMA request for a representative from Nestlé. *What's it like working for a company that is pure evil?*
The fact that this was ever a problem at all is mindboggling. The chain of scum that must've instituted this practice is long, starting with the people buying product at the market, and ending with boat captains purposely hiring indentured workers. Humanity is only as good as it treats its weakest members.  Just buying ethical food would choke this sort of behavior out, but the majority can't be arsed to think about it. Shame on me too, for not checking labels closely enough. This needs to stop. 
Nestle, please stop being evil. I can't boycott you more than I already have for your countless terrible actions over the years. 
If you or I own a slave we will definitely face legal action, if a global corporation owns slaves they get a sharp tut, tut!


I myself from now on will do my due diligence to ensure I never knowingly buy another nestle product, I have never bought a bottle of water, nestle or any other brand. Any sentient being should know unless it's an emergency and it's the only water available, bottled water is one of the biggest scams in history and only an imbecile would pay hard earned money for a bottle of water.
What an outrage *stuffs face with chocolate*
Nestle has always had a reputation for being one of the most nasty corporate moguls for as long as it's been around 
"...primarily in their Purina brand Fancy Feast cat food.."

Those uppity cats! I KNEW IT! Those feline 1%ers have had it out for humanity since day one! We adored them as they quietly schemed our final demise. 
and chocolate and sugar and...
They also buy from slave coco farms in Africa.

Not to mention, on a less intense note, their water rights issues.

I never buy nestle, its really easy to buy Mars or some other water brand, and I suggest everyone follow suit. Mars actually has programs in West Africa and are more morally stable
It’s amazing that in 2015, corporations like Nestle can essentially profit from slavery and Wall Street banks can gamble with the world’s economy, only to be slapped with lawsuits that yield negligible fines (in comparison to how much they make) or in some cases, be rewarded with bailouts. We need to punish corporations far more severely.
EDIT: Insert Bane image here
But hey, capitalism is pro-freedom isn't it?
I'm coming into this late..I thought Nestle was chocolate and water.  Are they run by by Dr.Evil now?
I'm not ready to use slaves, but I would like to hear more about using coercion next time I go fishing.
Fair trade ***NOT*** Free trade.

200% trade tariffs on all countries whose environmental and labor protections do not match or exceed our own.

A race to the top, not the bottom. If you have a problem with this you're on the wrong fucking side of history. 

If I'm wrong about where the future of humanity is going... I can't wait to make you and your family my slaves so you can experience first hand how awful things are elsewhere. See ya on the battlefield.
Well they were already on Donald Trump's shit list
I'm really sick of reading about people having to pay off a job broker and working in debt, or worse, getting their passport taken away form them when working in a different country.
Ships A'hoy?! Those be slave ships.
I expect them to self police and investigate reports of poor working conditions from NGOs and news outlets.
I'm always put off by that ad where that woman says "When you LOVE someone, you want them to have THE BEST. When I buy you a bottle of pure life, I'm buying a bottle of LOVE. Good food, good life."
There's seafood in my chocolate?

Fuck you
Something tells me that this won't last long on the front page.  Removal in 3...2....
Is this the same Nestlé​ that makes milkshake powder stuff?
Exploitation is what keeps prices low.  Nobody complains about low prices!
Hopefully they can find, even if it wasn't a pet.
Every human on this planet is complicit in slave labor. Lets just get to it. 
That's okay, let's just import all poor Thais to the EU and give them housing, welfare, and a residence permit. 
If they admit to slavery then all business with the USA, and wherever else slavery is abolished, should be immediately stopped.

If not then were know where the world stands on this subject.
Fucking clickbait title. You should be sold to a fishing company in Thailand.
throw secrecy in there too because I had no idea they did anything with seafood.
Wait... What?!? Nestle sells seafood?!
Fuck nestle 
Oh great. Now where will I buy my chocolate gefilte fish from with good conscience?
that's what you get when buying from large corporations, they have to make profit somewhow no matter what

As a native to New Orleans, Nestle catches seafood? TIL.
Nestle seafood?
In case anyone's interested in joining a [boycotting effort] (http://www.propcott.com/p/nestl-boycott-8) by a non-profit determined to take down Nestle
TIL Nestle sells seafood
So who's getting prosecuted?
They have dolphin slave labor camps. 
Will boycotting help remedy this situation or make it worse for the slaves?
There is fish in their slave juice?
oh wow, now we have to socially bring justice with boycotts- oh wait. no. no one will do that because they dont care when it severely causes them to change their life. thanks.
First Nestle steals water, and now they admit to slavery and coercion.

They are a real life SPECTRE organiziation...
Is there a way to get a list of the companies that get seafood out of Thailand? That way I know where not to go?

There's seafood in my chocolate?! But I'm allergic!! Why isn't on the label?!?!
&gt; Boat captains rarely checked ages of workers, and Verité found underage workers forced to fish. Workers said they labour without rest, their food and water are minimal, outside contact is cut off, and they are given fake identities to hide that they are working illegally.

You would think that they could keep their slave labor hydrated with all of the water they bottle in water-wealthy California. There's plenty for everyone! 
How much seafood is in Nestle chocolate candy ?
I believe other chocolate factories have no fish parts in their candy..
Rah
Nestle is stepping up their pr game. Give that man/woman a raise.
So are there any cat foods that don't use slave labor?  I have to feed my kitties but I guess I'll be avoiding Friskies and Purina.  I didn't even know they we're Nestle.
Money for nothing, and the chicks for free.
I wish this company wasn't so corrupted.  I loved their butter fingers, but is a turn off when the company uses slave labor. 
I wish this company wasn't so corrupted.  I loved their butter fingers, but is a turn off when the company uses slave labor. 
....and the CEO got a $10 million bonus for cost cutting. 
This upsets me so much that I will stop eating Nestle products for at least  few days
Hey, slavery is effective and both economical and ecologically great! I mean look at the pyramids!
The thing I learned today is that Nestlé sells seafood.
Nestle doesn't care all the management feels they are untouchable and will never see jail. They also know that any fines will be less than the money they saved and in the rare case it is not it will not be anything remotely able to threaten their buisness and will use it as an excuse for layoffs.   They are also right. 
Welp, there goes their stocks.
Who is going to jail then?
So that's where those jobs went....
I know this is serious, but I like to imagine them using coercion on the fish themselves, like, "Hey there buddy, how about you do your old pal Nestle a favor and jump into this net here."
I believe a useless slap on the wrist is in order?
Nestle is what would happen if Willy Wonka found the One Ring.
Can this help shutdown their water bottle operations?
You know... This isn't even the worst thing Nestle has done. Kind of middle of the road for them.
I would boycott Nestle, but I'm afraid I like Kit Kats too much.
Well, my kitty princess isn't exactly going to catch the fish for her fancy feast on her own is she?  IS SHE!?
Yea...
But its okay when Willy Wonka does it!!
WTF!!!
have they changed their stance on water not being a fundamental right to all people yet?
Nestle is evil. Fuck that company.
who cares
List of companies that uses slave labor?
This is impossible.  My history teacher says slavery ended in 1866.
Considering nestle massive profits no one actually gives a fuck enough to actually boycott them. 
Am I the only here that does not think of seafood when I think of Nestle?
How do I know this isn't sponsored content?
Is anyone actually surprised?
Now I know what John Oliver will discuss in the next episode of his show.
TIL Nestle makes more than chocolate products
didn't some nestle punk say that water shouldn't be a human right?
But the chocolate, the chocolate is union made by middle class laborers who have little white houses with picket fences and a S/O maybe even a few kids, right? 
And they replaced the cocoa butter with vegetable oil and the Mr. Goodbar taste like shart.
These are the same guys that believe clean water is not a human right so....
Oh Nestle, another one?
Am I the only one who knew nestle sold seafood products? 
Nestle is an American company are they not? They should be taken to court for 13th Amendment violations.
How do people still buy from this company.   They are the absolute worst 
But I love their sweet tarts chewy sours...

Nestle has everything. 
Is it entirely horrible that none of us are probably surprised Nestle is involved in this kind of story ? There is corporate greed, incompetence and malice, and then there is Nestle.
So fuck Nestlé right?
"Sometimes, the net is too heavy and workers get pulled into the water and just disappear. When someone dies, he gets thrown into the water,"

how did Nestle coerce the fish?

did they just hang out a net and have some guy go "Here fishy, fishy, fishy"?

The first step is admitting that you have a problem. 
Put the cunts in jail.
wtf... Nestle sells seafood?? How do you go from chocolate to seafood?

TIL Nestlé sells seafood
Pfft seafood. Who eat seafood anyway, especially daily? 
Shocker. An international company exploiting impoverished workers. Who would have guessed..
Y'all still eat fish?
The use of slaves in the Thai fishing industry has been common knowledge for fifteen years. That Verité played along with Nestlé in this research charade shows how serious both organizations are about the rights of workers.
Since the executive class is never *really* at risk of facing prison time for the flagrantly illegal actions they engage in as executives, there needs to be a death penalty for corporations themselves. 

That or just stop putting millionaires and billionaires above the law.

I favor the latter.
There 21 million people still in slavery today.
Somehow, I'm not even surprised.

Nestlé, a company that wanted/wants to privatize water.
Well how else am I able to buy a kilo of prawns for $10 at the supermarket? Of course thailand has dodgy means to produce all this.
This seems to be a problem in southeast asia. Nestle itself is not using slave labor, but the company that sells it to them is.
Oh. Ok. Thanks. Now lets go back to living our lives because i doubt anyone can do anything about it
N-e-s-t-l-e-s, Nestle makes the very best...uh, corporate creeps.
Leave Nestlé alone. Their chocolate is awesome and contains no seafood.
I don't wanna be that guy but is Thailand state of affairs so bad that they don't have any employment protection policies ?
TIL:  Nestle has seafood.
I don't why this is headlined. They have been using child slave labour for years in the chocolate industry. 
TIL Nestlé deals in more than just chocolate and water.
Nestle is a shitty company.  What is new?  Stop buying their stuff and they will go away
The title on this post is pretty misleading
wait.. so did nestle do something honorable and good but then is now getting scrutinized because people aren't understanding what they did?

"One medium slap on the wrist please."
I worked on fishing boats and at processing plants. Of course the companies pay as little as possible! Most workers at the processing plant were from Western Africa or Philippines. The workers paid for food and housing and had very little left after working. Terrible conditions (cold, wet, stinky) but they were happy to have the work and take money home at the end of the season.

Interesting... they clearly aren't the only ones doing this too, but at least they took actions themselves I suppose

Read "90 Percent of Everything" by Rose George for insight into the shipping industry and the atrocious standards.

http://www.npr.org/2013/08/14/211981786/shipping-the-invisible-industry-that-clothes-and-feeds-you 
This won't embarrass ministers at all. They don't care in the slightest as long as the party donations and other bungs from fossil fuel interests keep rolling in.
I feel this actually has more to do with pre-empting [this](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/utilities/11589712/New-government-faces-potential-energy-crisis-warns-expert.html) perceived energy crisis and preventing blackouts in the winter than anything else (I don't vote Tory, I'm a disgruntled Labour voter).

Natural energy simply isn't covering the immediate need as we didn't get enough wind recently apparently, not to mention energy drawn from wind would cost more than fossil fuels. That's not good for people already struggling with money over winter that don't want to see their power bill increase a great deal (prices will rise undoubtedly).

So I do believe this is a genuine attempt to safeguard our energy situation by our government, at least for the immediate future.... it's just that lowering taxes is the Tory way of doing that :/ Unfortunately though this is just a short-sighted attempt to fix an immediate problem that wouldn't exist if we had shown some foresight in the first place, but alas this is the predicament we are in. 
For those not familiar with Guardian speak: "handout" and "subsidy" mean "tax cut"

The taxes on North Sea oil production are huge and they were recently reduced. This will not increase fossil fuel use as the North Sea Oil production is already well past it's peak and on the decline.
A brief explanation:

Taxes get paid to the government.

Subsidies get paid by the government to someone else.

If taxes go up, that's called a tax increase.

If taxes go down, it's still a tax, not a subsidy.

If the increase in the tax rates is reduced, so it's still higher than before, it's still a tax, not a subsidy.

Allowing a company to claim expenses on equipment, manufacturing and production costs against taxes is not a subsidy.
Fuck Cameron and the Conservatives, why would anyone ever vote for them?
Objectively, it is getting much harder to have a fossil fuel industry in the UK. Part of my family live in Aberdeen and they've noticed a huge downturn since oil prices dropped. The UK simply isn't a cost-effective manufacturing (except for motor vehicles) centre any more.

Additionally, the government has continually relied on being perceived as the safer economic bet than Labour; if our fossil fuel industry went down the pan completely they couldn't claim that moral high ground.

Add in corporate interests, stir, and there's the recipe for why they can't afford not to subsidise. 
I'm going to be Devil's advocate here, because why the hell not?

Ok, the Saudi sandpeople-beheading-thundercunts are overproducing thousands of barrels A DAY. They do this, so smalltime oil producers (in countries like Venezuela), can't compete.

Thus, if Britain wants to stay competitive (and save hundreds, if not thousands of jobs), subsidizing these companies isn't irrational.

...or they're just greedy fuckers who like to be lubed with BP oil before being pounded in the ass by Shell's CEO...
I fucking hate the conservatives, it makes my blood boil that these pricks got elected with ~25% of the vote, and have a majority government.
It's not a handout but a tax cut for North Sea oil extraction, taxes for which were extremely high in the past decade. 

Where renewables are concerned, wind and solar was always an idiotic thing to do in UK. Should have gone with nukes. At least now government will throw a bit less money at this stupidity. 
Since we need energy it is only reasonable that the means to access said energy are facilitated. To call it "subsidizing" is daft; in that case everything the state undertakes for its citizens is a "subsidy". Renewables is a nice idea but the technology is still far from producing the necessary volume in terms of energy.

How American.
Who exactly is this surprising? They're basically mirroring the US' government at this point
UK government are controlled by banks and corporations. Take a look at the policies and results of the  past 25 years.

our current government sucks ass
What the hell.  Why.  
Thick bastards
Check out my wacky new policy!

Government employees (even the President or Prime Minister) are not allowed any donations, funding, or whatever you want to call it. Their bank account(s) will be monitored constantly to ensure the only money received is from their wages.

Also, members of significance must have a 24 hour live stream of themselves while holding their position. No secrets. No shade. No bribes. No evil. Open source government.

Also, I don't know what I'm talking about, but still, I would like to see something like the above.


Wow... I'm surprised you haven't used some of that stolen tech from Torchwood to power your nation yet. 
Why is it always the right wing parties who disregard environmental science? 
Australia (not a G7 country) has also done this. We voted in politicians who cannot see past the lure of donations from big polluters. Sorry world.
Why do people still listen to The Guardian?

Its a shit rag about as useful as The Daily Fail, but for lefties.

There were no 'handouts' or 'subsidies', it was a tax cut to try and keep North Sea Oil going so loads of people dont lose their jobs.

As others have said, a combination of an oil glut/overproduction, coupled with economic issues and high costs is meaning North Sea Oil is going the way of the British Coal Mine. They just arent profitable.

This will NOT mean an increase in fossil fuel usage.

Hell, the Tories are trying to get a whole new range of nuclear stations built to take over baseload power production, by far one of the best energy strategies. It is taking ime and Greenpeace and other idiots are blocking them at every turn......
Australia is holding its hand up for a high five 
Thanks, ~~Obama~~ Cameron.
Ah a headline with left leaning tonality. I guess it is the Guardian. I look at the link. I am correct. I dismiss the article for this reason alone. 

For verification, I also do the same with right leaning articles from the Telegraph.

My preference is for facts and non agenda news. Not much of that these days though.
I'm hearing the politics in the UK is becoming somewhat like in the US and I do not like that. 
it's both comforting and unsettling knowing that governments across the pond are also huge assholes who do really stupid things that are obviously only in the best interest of a very select few. I am starting to think greed is actually a mental disorder. 
It's cheap energy. We'll all pay the price in favor of temporary, quick profits.
Wait, weren't lefties mad when Tories shut down all those coal mines? So now that was ok then?
I know this might not be a super-popular opinion but even though this sounds really shitty at face value IMHO it may the the lesser of two evils:

- On one side there's the long-term benefit of investing in renewables, something everyone knows about.  Investment in renewables takes time to pay off but it gradually reduces the overall requirement and pays huge dividends over the lifespan of those renewable sources.  However, the UK's ability to exploit renewable resources is limited by their geography.  There's not a ton of land available compared to many other countries (limiting the land available for solar or wind production), they're quite far north (limiting the efficiency of solar), and they often have cloud cover (again, bad for solar).  Offshore wind production might still be a viable opportunity, I don't know enough about the subject to say.

- On the other side there's the *extremely urgent requirement* to increase Europe's energy independence.  While the UK itself doesn't import natural gas from Russia (they mostly get it from Norway IIRC), Russia's got many other European countries *by the balls*.  If the UK can reduce its natural gas imports, there will be more non-Russian natural gas available for other European countries, and likely at a more competitive price.

While the UK doesn't import natural gas from Russia, it still gets a lot of coal from them - around ~20 million tons annually.  Natural gas is a much cleaner energy source than coal, so while increasing their natural gas exploitation sounds like a bad thing by itself, increased natural gas production would likely mean a further shift away from coal.  People generally understand that coal-based power production creates a lot of pollution, but a little-known fact is [how dangerous it truly is to human health](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/).

Any steps that can be taken to rapidly increase Europe's fossil fuel independence in the short term need to be the highest priority right now.  The UK (and by extension the rest of Europe) are too reliant on Russia for fossil fuels, and Russia's demonstrated recently that they're willing to use that fact as an economic cudgel by threatening to cut off their supply if customers make them unhappy.  This has enormous repercussions for the political landscape of Europe.

To be clear, I'm Canadian and haven't got any direct stake in this. I'm just giving my assessment of the situation based on what little I know of European politics.  Most of this information came from my own memory but [this site](http://www.carbonbrief.org/gas-from-norway-coal-from-russia-eight-graphs-on-the-uk-energy-system) seems like a credible citation if anyone's interested in reading more.
Ironic, maybe Iran etc will make the UK a colony, once they are completely dependent on oil.



It's cheap energy. We'll all pay the price in favor of temporary, quick profits.
It's always heartwarming to hear that the US is not the only batshit insane country in the world.
It's especially sad as Scotland, where all the oil is, is also one of the best places in Europe to site renewable power. The renewables sector could easily grow to fill the gap left by the declining oil industry. 
I'm not English, so I don't quite get it...  
Are Tories Bond villains or a political party? Is there a difference?
G7?  Who got kicked out of the G8?
It may be the only one now, but I'm sure if this happened two months ago, we could see Canada and Australia(not G7, I know) following suit.
Is money really worth selling your soul and destroying the land our children will inherit? Apparently yes. 
Man I can't wait to club my neighbours to death for a bottle of water, while these fucks chill somewhere safe.

Sucks too, the UK has insane potential for renewables, especially wave/tidal power.

How do regular UK citizens feel? Did you guys vote for these arses?
This is honestly pathetic. Pure Corruption.
Subsidies for green or oil, I am getting burned in Ontario.

It's not always the subsidies of oil companies burdening everyone. Citizens pay for this one way or another. Subsidies can piss off.

We're fucking doomed. Everyone talks about how fucked the planet is, and how it should be fixed, and turns around and adds to the issues at the same time. Saying and doing two different things. My son is going to inherit a devastated planet full of garbage, smog, religious nut-jobs, and the memories of tens of thousands of extinct species, and the bones of millions of dead. We *need* to start saving ourselves and our home, and begin holding people accountable for their actions regarding our future.
And to think, I voted for them because I thought Ed Miliband would ruin the country... How wrong I was.
Did you guys get Stephen Harper?
Looks like he took a page from Tony Abott's book...
Never trust a redcoat
How do regular UK citizens feel? Did you guys vote for these arses?
They will represent whoever bribes them more...right now that's the oil/gas industry. 

The entire system broken and nothing will improve until it gets fixed. 
As an Australian, this sounds awfully familiar.
Cameron sounds a lot like Harper
Fucking torries. This on top of the hundreds of protests later just makes me believe that all the 'votes' they got were bullshit.
Conservative government in Australia has been doing similar. You can tell which companies are bankrolling the conservatives.
Oil will be kept around by the countries that sell themselves to it.
Sounds like the demon known as Harper has found a new host.
4 more years.
Guillotines, why did they go out of fashion again?
PUssies
Aside from supposedly lowering/maintaining the price of fuel, can anyone tell us why fossil fuel industries need subsidies? If they can't survive without hand-holding then maybe they should be allowed to go extinct? We are, after all, meant to be living under free-market capitalism.
I feel sorry for you UK, you became the next Australia. Our fuckwit politicians decided that increasing support for fossil fuels whilst decreasing funding for clean energy was a good idea.
Did Tony Abbott join the Tory's?
Like most Guardian articles, this one has an axe to grind. It references other Guardian articles, and cites dodgy statistics: that oil and gas investment rose from  this to that as a percent of total energy. As there has been a cutback in all energy projects, and as O&amp;G projects are generally extremely slow to halt, this is an expected outcome. However: 

&gt; [North Sea faces £12bn investment collapse from oil price slump. Offshore industry in the UK has lost 65,000 jobs but companies now adapting to lower oil price, says Oil and Gas UK](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/energy/oilandgas/11851219/North-Sea-faces-12bn-investment-collapse-from-oil-price-slump.html)

The Guardian seems to regard any variation on taxation as a subsidy. Thus, a depreciation allowance is a "subsidy". This is almost as bad as the IMF assessment, which took any sum less than the deemed overall environmental cost of using a particular energy as a "subsidy". 

In fact, the [House of Commons Energy Select Committee](http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/environmental-audit-committee/news/energy-subsidies-in-the-uk-inquiry/) is beginning to take evidence on the overall UK subsidy picture. This starts with an assessment of what in fact constitutes a "subsidy". Oxford Energy are advising. 
This is exactly what you fucking voted for.
Aah - it's a British thing - that explains Tony Abbott's stance in Australia! (We're only G20 I believe)
Devil's advocate: The country needs cheaper energy considering the winter climate we have every year. Renewable isn't yet meeting the country's needs and our old grannies ideally would like to survive to spring. 

Although saying that I highly doubt this will lead to any real price-drops. Greedy bastards. 
Its almost as if major infrastructure runs on oil still and not solar and wind and they want to be independent from Russia or something...
Going the oil and gas route is a shame. A shame to be laid at the door of the idiots who advocate clean energy. Clean energy simply does not cover our energy demands, and it's been proven multiple times that wind farms cost more to maintain than the energy they generate is worth. If it wasn't for all these green dipshits protesting it to death, and we'd invested in nuclear power, we'd be a lot better off and not facing brown/black-outs in the near future because clean energy can't provide us with the power we need, and our traditional sources of energy have been neglected in favour of this ridiculous bullshit.  

Adding more nuclear plants could've given us the wiggle room to actually invest in, and develop alternatives to nuclear/fossil fuels. Once again the country has been fucked over by the swivel eyed lunatics. 
what a surprise. cunts.
Aka Cameron's unmatched ability to deep throat corporate cock continues to impress other G7 leaders. 
Fuck Cameron and the Conservatives, why would anyone ever vote for them?
Fuck off Cameron you tory Lizard
That's because they are money grabbing pieces of shit - just like the fuckheads who voted for them. \*cough* England \*cough cough*

Down vote me - because you're a fucking Tory scumbag.
Jesus UK, sort your shit government out.  It's shit headline after another with you guys.
So this is what Australia felt like under that Abbott guy.
there is a simple solution the french thought up in 1789, i think its time we try it.
Systematic political corruption can only be stopped with heartless violence. Corruption is like a cancer, it wont stop because you say "cut it out" you must physically cut it out. Burn a few politicians alive, they'll change their tune rather quickly, a couple thousand bucks isn't worth being barbequed. Although I doubt anyone will be driven to such action until a huge recession hits, and it will when the US debt finally catches up with them. 
They are funding bribes for scotland so they don't go off in a huff.

If they didn't the oil industry would shut up shop and significantly hit scottish employment and economy. They said one of the reasons the scots were better off in the union was because they could make further, desperate, exploration viable, so that's what they are doing. 
The solar panels can power 2500 homes in the middle of the day in the middle of summer as long as it's not too cloudy. Come home to cook dinner in winter and it's salad all round by candlelight.

For the rest of the time it's wind turbines - unless it's too windy or not windy enough

Then there is gas and coal - but we can't use them because of all the nasty CO2

So what about hydro, 1GW, enough for 35 watts per household and very dependent on rainfall so limited run time at that power level. That's enough for a few low energy lamps but nowhere near enough for a kettle

Pumped storage, can't use that as it's got a limited run time and how do we get the water uphill in the first place when there is no surplus as it's dark and not windy enough or too windy

What's left, imported woodchips from the USA

Imported nuclear from France - except in winter they will have no surplus, their crackpot government deciding to 'go green' and reduce nuclear from 75% to 50% of demand and subsidise coal to reduce CO2 emissions

Imported hydro from Norway by around 2020, the interconnector limited to 2GW, enough for a few more low energy lamps, and they will be propping up Germany with any surplus.

Finally existing UK nuclear - being closed over the next 10 - 20 years
Of course they are. If they don't the SNP will bitch and moan that the Conservatives are sabotaging Scotland, and demand another referendum.
WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON
At least the molotovs and petrol bombs will be cheaper for protesters now.
Just when I start to think the US is getting too corrupt, I see this sort of thing happen across the Atlantic.
Maggie is smiling from heaven.
Good burning fossil fuels is a moral endeavor 
The Tories appear to be out to make everything worse for everyone except the very wealthy in this country.
the handouts are pure profit to the oil companies.

It makes me ashamed to be British.  
fish and chips m8
Yaayyyy it's not the US this time yaaayyyyy!
The community is subsidizing something that actually works. Sounds good.
I don't understand, why exactly whould they do that? Is not commonly agreed that it is better to switch to clean energy now?
Saudi Arabia won't last long other countries will come soon. We are on the peak of oil production. We will never produce this much oil again.

 It's real and its happening. 

People that don't focus on renewable energy basicly say fuck you to the future generations. It probably doesn't effect us that much but it will effect the next generation, well i hope there will be a solution.



aaaaaand what is the world gonna do about this?
^^^^probably ^^^^nothing
Really? Even Canada, a massive oil producer, invests tons in green energy! Why would the UK, with much more limited oil reserves than Canada, only invest in fossil fuels? I mean, sure, it is profitable, but as I have probably made clear, they are no Canada.

I wonder how much of that is going directly to BP to pay for Deepwater Horizon.
At the risk of ridicule, what is G7?
At least the molotovs and petrol bombs will be cheaper for protesters now.
Campaign contribution works in UK too. I am too novice to think it only works in US.
But they're [the Greenest Government Ever!!!](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pms-speech-at-decc) It MUST be true, our Prime Minister said it himself. 


The new Danish government has decided to lower the support for clean energy aswell. The reason being: "well.. now we've been number 1 country in this field for long enough.. Just being part of the best will still be ok!"
For those not familiar with Guardian speak: "handout" and "subsidy" mean "tax cut"

The taxes on North Sea oil production are huge and they were recently reduced. This will not increase fossil fuel use as the North Sea Oil production is already well past it's peak and on the decline.
Come on UK! You need to get with it, the world needs to come together on this issue before it's too late.
Why are conservatives evil?  I really would like some kind of answer to this question some day.
I hope in time fossil fuel companies will become like cable companies are now.

And yes I know we'll always need *some* amount of oil.
So is it the same in the UK as it is in America. The older folks keep voting in the conservatives while young people, who favor the more liberal party, just don't come out and vote?
I don't know how many times I find myself saying this but I still haven't seen a story that actually makes my country seem nice on /r/worldnews
Is this to ensure their oil producers remain viable during this sustained price drop? I mean right now the world is battling over high supply and low demand, the first producer to start shutting down production will not be able to maintain their market share, until world oil demand outweighs supply and they can get production back online.

If they're giving fuel subsidies to ensure that UK oil companies maintain production and don't have to layoff employees then isn't that a good thing?

As for the green subsidies... I don't see a point in having any green subsidies right now either. Commodities are so cheap right now that you would have to give massive green energy subsidies to make it cost effective vs oil, gas and coal energy production. 

Best bet right now may be to keep oil production subsidized and semi-profitable to maintain UK oil market share and employment. It also makes sense to decrease green energy subsidies as most methods are not close to being cost effective in this low cost commodity environment.

It'll be much better for the UK taxpayer and much more realistic to wait for commodities to go back up and then start increasing green subsidies. Otherwise you're just paying out the ass to keep green energy competitive vs other methods during a supposed short term (1-2 year) commodity price drop.
CREAM
I wonder if these gys wil ever be couped
Makes you think what that Scottish independence referendum's really about and was it genuinely a grass root movement or somehow influenced behind the scene by the oil company profiting from north sea oil fields.
This headline wouldn't have existed without Harper out. Yay Canada!
LOL G7 LOL
We would increase ours here in the US, but they are already maxed out. 
UK does have a little Scottish problem!
How are they defining "subsidies"?
Huh... Usually it's America doing something like this. It's nice not being in the spotlight for doing something bad for the environment! 
We need WWIII + major civilian revolution if we want the economical petrol system to change. Does anyone think it might happen :)?
However, the UK's ability to rule or loss in their ability to rule or loss in their self belief, or both.
I really like that way of becoming corrupt, and will probably continue to rebalance the system.
Renewable isn't yet meeting the country's needs and our old grannies ideally would like to see something like 75% of the British Coal Mine.
I'm hearing the politics in the Constitution as long as the upper class in shaping the world, for better or worse.
Who votes for these clowns?
Of course.



Good job electing these assbaskets, guys. Really spectacular stuff.
Ah the UK. How far you have fallen...
Seriously, George Osborne is a cunt.  
But the US is the bad guy, right guys? 
Most of the dipshits complaining here about the system don't show up to vote on all (if any) election cycles. Want change? Show up to vote. 
It is because they are horrible self-serving cunts. And as /u/nioki23 said:
 &gt; This won't embarrass ministers at all. They don't care in the slightest as long as the party donations and other bungs from fossil fuel interests keep rolling in
Jesus fucking christ, this is what we voted for. This shit makes me ashamed to live here.
The Tories would do anything for the money. Killing the environment, whoring out to human rights-breaching China or refusing to help Syrians displaced by war.

Their #1 policy is basically extorting the EU for policy advantages without seeing the hypocrisy regarding Scotland and their union...
This is disgusting. 
Oh, my.  I think we Americans can unite with Canadians in being smug towards dad.
Ugh the Tories are toxic cunts
That's what you get when you vote Conservative. Who needs a DeLorean when we can already travel backwards in time, hooray!
Tories really don't give a fuck...they'd rather win the short term than see see britain into the future....lmao..apparently not only dumb americans vote against their interest but so do the british as well.
Ha ha! Now you're the Tony Abbott! 
Fuck the 36% of our electorate that were ignorant enough to vote for these cunts.
As if the Conservatives give a fuck. As long as the cash keep flooding they don't care about the water flooding. 
Is that because BP got taken for everything they've got by Obama?
Why even subsidies exist for multi million dollar companies and corporations is beyond me. Looks like western world is not done yet with pay me up peasant ideology. 
ShAME! SHAME SHAME SHAME!!!
It may be in my best interest to move to UK.
They are funding bribes for scotland so they don't go off in a huff.

If they didn't the oil industry would shut up shop and significantly hit scottish employment and economy. They said one of the reasons the scots were better off in the union was because they could make further, desperate, exploration viable, so that's what they are doing. 
Those obscene profits aren't going to make themselves.

It's ever surprising to me that people don't understand that oil won't be going away until all of the fat cats have reaped their profits.

Governments don't run the world.  People don't run the world.  The corporations run the world and tell everyone else what to do.  We're all whores to the money.
Let's be honest here, the title should read "UK becomes the only G7 country to increase fossil fuel subsidies"...that we know of.
Remember when Cameron re-branded the tories "the green party". They even changed their logo!

After the crash it all changed and I haven't seen one major policy to deal with climate change or the environment and plenty that completely contradict the party's re-branding.

Why are people happy to vote for governments that completely against their promises? The electorate seem perfectly happy to be lied to over and over again.  
Carry on neglecting climate change like this and the corporate barad dur will crumble from the bottom up...There simply won't be the resources or labour to maintain the current infrastructure if crop yields drop by 40%, people die by the hundreds of millions and weather systems become disastrous.
What a bunch of dickheads
Thorium reactor? No? O.K bye. :(
Money + Politics should not mix, as soon as you introduce money into politics you no longer have a democracy but a leader available for the highest bidder.
Good. Who cares man fuck the planet I will be dead in less than 40 years so unless someone comes in with definitive proof of an after life rebirth or reincarnation then I don't really give a shit. 

Sounds selfish or whatever adjective you choose to use. I wouldn't disagree but I can't get myself to care when it's such a struggle to survive day to day. It strikes me all this bullshit is so much easier when you are well off.  
Ah I love democracy and first past the post elections. Really made UK the shit stain we deserve to be.
Can't we just agree that politics is filled with slimy fuck-heads handing out tax money to billionaires while screaming poverty and cutting social services for the people they represent and start this fucking revolution already! I've got all these picks and torches and nothing to pick and torch
This is ridiculous. Politicians selling out the populace. And Earth. Well, Earth can survive without us. Can we survive without it?
How depressing. 
I wish the world would push to make fossil fuel irrelevant.

Imagine where we would be if we spent all the money in war and handouts for these companies on alternative renewable energy?
Instead the world is less secure and they get showered with money while society pays all the risk for maintaining their short term profit business model to keep their fat cat major shareholders happy. As if their shareholders have no where else to invest. 

The world very much has the means.
All we need is the political will to move on, but that will is stiffed by continued corruption by these companies their institutional shareholders.

ELI5: Is it just blatantly obvious that those in charge of most major countries are bought and paid for by the oil companies? Why else would they choose to give taxpayer dollars to the companies polluting the earth instead of either   
1. Giving taxpayer dollars to no one because it's not the governments job to meddle in private industry.  
Or.   
2. At least invest it in a type of energy that will reduce electric/travel costs for the taxpayer who is paying for it. 
I'm so ashamed of our government lately. 
You know who needs more money?

Oil companies!
you mean fossil fuel industry is giving itself more money
Thanks Cameron
Corruption at its finest! 
a forebear of things to come if we elect republicans to our chief office.
Wow, America's not too shabby in the limelight right now.
this infuriates me. the UK government is so useless!
this is conservative doctrine. 
Always been my perspective. UK with Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair making US Blush these days in terms of showing the US how conservatism is done.
Tories are vile selfish self serving fucks and their world view needs to be stamped on. Which I think it will in the near future, as the unsustainable greed model they pout starts to crumble.
This is what evil looks like, I guess.
start burning Tories, problem solved. 
*"Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone circling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved."*


The hairs stood up on the back of my neck the first time I read the end of the book. Still do actually. Although I'd have to argue Principia Mathematica is a pretty important book as well.
Not to downplay the importance of Darwin's observations, but... I mean... 

My vote goes for Sir Isaac Newton's [Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophi%C3%A6_Naturalis_Principia_Mathematica). 

&gt; The Principia states Newton's laws of motion, forming the foundation of classical mechanics, also Newton's law of universal gravitation, and a derivation of Kepler's laws of planetary motion (which Kepler first obtained empirically).

In these books, Newton also invented Calculus. 

Edit: To make /u/NorthernIron and the ghost of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz happy, I should point out that Newton and Leibniz are [both credited](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus#Legacy) for independently inventing the basis of Calculus in the 17th century, and it's Leibniz's notation that is primarily used, today. 
I was reading On The Origin Of Species on the night I met my wife in the University bar (I was slacking, she had had a lecture cancelled due to a sick lecturer). She joined in the conversation I was having with the bar staff about Origin of Species, and I guess I made an impression on her. That night was 20 years and 17 days ago (25th October 1995). We've been married for 17 years and have two great kids and house in the suburbs etc. If it wasn't for On The Origin Of Species (or the fact her lecturer was sick that day) almost half my life would have been 100% different from what it has been..
Let's not forget [Alfred Russel Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Russel_Wallace).
Perfect choice, and not just because of the game-changing theory. The other aspect is that this book is the pinnacle example of science communication to the public. It's a little more difficult to read as a lay-person today (150 years can do a lot to a language), but it successfully showed how complex scientific ideas can be broken down and disseminated for non-scientists without significant loss of fidelity. Darwin was a tremendous communicator.
Free to read on Project Gutenburg, I feel I should follow through and read it.

Someone should show this to Ben Carson. 
Completely debunked by Ben Carson.  not worth the read imo
It's very unusual in that it's a highly influential academic book that's easily understandable by a non-expert.  Darwin writes in clear, non-technical language and does a fantastic job at explaining evolution and the evidence in favor of it.  Even if it wasn't the starting point for evolution, I'd recommend it just as a piece of amazing technical writing.
This thread is the very embodiment of /r/iamverysmart 
I'm not sure if it's more influential than Newton's Principia, but I wouldn't dispute this. It's absolutely shaped how we think about biology and life as a whole. 
Alfred Wallace did it too! 
Glad to see Wealth of Nations up there. Pretty eurocentric list, then again the world is pretty eurocentric.
What? No Dianetics?
The book is also up there with Newton's Principia as science's most unread classic.
He wrote a good book about earthworms , worked on it his whole life, last book he published.
The funny thing is that Darwin and his *Origin of the species* would be no more remarkable or well known than a hundred of similar works that advanced scientific progress if it weren't for the people who misunderstood and rallied against it.
Thank you all for the post and the comments. I really learned a lot in this thread.
[To the voters.](http://i.imgur.com/vB9B5.gif)
If it one of the most influential books, we should at least be promoting the full title of the book. On the Origin of Species by means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.
Everytime someone says something is THE MOST without giving explicit quantitative methods based in objective evidence in how one can get to that conclusion, absurd debates are going to start.

But, yeah. Darwin rocks.
That's because it is the most influential academic book of all time! The only other potential ones would be Sir Isaac Newton's *Principia*, Copernicus' *On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres*, and Einstein's *Relativity: The Special and General Theory*, but none of them are as influential as Darwin. Good for him!

Darwin's ideas have shaped modern biology, anthropology, genetics, and paleontology.
It does seem odd given that Wallace gave Darwin his book on evolution a year earlier.  As I understand it Darwin was pretty good about crediting Wallace.    
Euclid's Elements seems like a better pic.
When I was in my sophomore year of high school, we had this tournament type debate thing where we had to pick an historic figure and go head to head with a classmate in a fight to determine who was the most influential person in the group. I chose Darwin and lost in the first round to the girl who chose Alexander Fleming (inventor of penicillin) obviously also a hugely influential person. I just couldn't convince my class that Darwin was the grandfather of modern genetics and possibly without his work, Fleming wouldn't have discovered/invented penicillin at all. Stupid popularity contests. This makes me feel better though, thanks for posting. 
There was a religious group on campus giving away this book that had a preface by some religious person in the church, in which it denounced the writings in the book, saying something about god being the most important thing and that the book was a lie. It invited the reader to read through the book and see the "lies".

I think it backfired on them. I started reading the preface with an open mind but by the time I got to the end of the first chapter of Darwin's writings, the craziness of the religious preface was very VERY evident.

Tl;dr, religious group gives out free Origins of Species copies to get more believers, backfires on them looking like idiots.
Oh come on what about Sir Francis Bacon.
[mildly interesting](http://imgur.com/hyyW3KO)
I'll just carry a copy with me at all times in case someone asks if I've read it...
So... I should read it then?
[This guy stumbled upon a decent little collection...](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/201106A21.html)
Next to *Origin* my next favorite book regarding discovery is *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions* - both great reads.
Wait who voted this in, 

&gt; expert academic booksellers, librarians and publishers

Really? I'm sure they read way more books than the average person but is that really who gets to decide what the most influential academic book is?

Shouldn't it be more like a collection of the top scientists, professors, Nobel winners and highly respected leaders.
Satanic illuminati totally confirmed
I was just driving through Pennsylvania and there is an anti-evolution billboard up.  There was a picture or primates evolving into man with a giant "No" circle around it.

The only source that was sited was Genisis was 1:1 "God created MAN"

[Found a pic.](http://i.imgur.com/oua3jHL.jpg)
Amazing read. It seems like every page starts at the top with an observed fact then states fact after fact right down to the bottom of the page. To dispute his work in any serious way you would have to dispute thousands and thousands of separate, independently observed  facts. The funny thing is when various people actually do attempt to discredit him, it always seems to be based on some vague sophistry with no supporting evidence whatsoever. 
People think Darwin was far more controversial than he actually was.

He said things, yes. He did make assertions. 

None of those things were new, they were just finally couched in science, which I might add, at the time, was pretty much law. He was just another natural scientist (read that as "scientist") in an era that actually had a lot of them.

The idea of evolution was no more controversial than the idea of hot things making colder things hotter and themselves colder. But, hey. Us.
I see that the influence of Alexander Von Humbolt has been erroneously omitted from this conversation. Darwin himself credited Humbolt's fieldwork as inspiration for his own work on Origin. 
The great thing about it is, the vast majority of Christians wholeheartedly agree with it.**

** Just not Americans and some Middle Easterners

It's not a very controversial book anymore.***

*** Outside of America and the Middle East
And how many people have actually fucking read the entire book?

&gt;At some future period, not very distant as measured by centuries, the civilized races of man will almost certainly exterminate, and replace, the savage races throughout the world. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes ... will no doubt be exterminated. The break between man and his nearest allies will then be wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilized state, as we may hope, even than the Caucasian, and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as now between the Negro or Australian and the gorilla.

 (Darwin 1887:156).

It definitely is influential, but there are many more texts that are far more influential, such as principia mathematica, helping define modern physics. I'm thinking that On the Origin of Species was put as high as it was simply for the controversy that surrounds the evolution debate (not that I disagree with it).
And also a book that at least 40% of the USA chooses not to believe. 
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/10/on-the-origin-of-species-voted-most-influential-academic-book-charles-darwin) reduced by 81%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; Charles Darwin&amp;#039;s On the Origin of Species has been voted the most influential academic book ever written, hailed as &amp;quot;The supreme demonstration of why academic books matter&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;a book which has changed the way we think about everything&amp;quot;.

&gt; After a list of the top 20 academic books was pulled together by expert academic booksellers, librarians and publishers to mark the inaugural Academic Book Week, the public was asked to vote on what they believed to be the most influential.

And it is still offending people to this date. 
And banned in my skool
But what if it offends meeeee?
Check out the audiobook read by Richard Dawkins. It's super awesome.
Is it an easy read? Honest question because I pick up books and don't read any further than a quarter of it.
By who?
A lot of people here don't know what 'influential' means. You don't have to agree for it to have an influence on you.
It's always amusing seeing creationists attempt to debunk Darwin, as if it has any relevance to the modern understanding of evolution. 
But isn't the Earth only 6000 years old? Also, wasn't Darwin a Satanist who was sent only to thwart the will of Jesus Christ? Why would Darwin tell such lies?
Tell this to the South. 

A book that has changed the way MOST OF US think about everything...

Religious nuttology recognizes nothing outside of nuttology...
The book that killed god.
The 20th century just called, they want their brand new realization back. 
Just interested what scientologists think about this book? Do they aggressively dismiss it like some religions do? 
I'm in the group that thinks Newton probably deserved the nudge. *Principia* is immeasurably important and still authoritative, but Darwin is right up there next to it. It's 1A and 1B.
This is exactly the kind of bullshit that ruined soft sciences and that I think we should seek to avoid.

Science is incremental. All scientists are important, even those who fail. We don't remember their names, but even Darwin might not have put 2 and 2 together if not for his predecessors.

I think this is eerily close to a "cult of personality", which don't advance knowledge and can make whole fields of study stagnate (ask an anthropologist).
Newton's *Principia* is without a shadow of a doubt the most important and astonishing book ever written. 

The fact that it did not even make this top 20 list shows it was put together by the scientifically illiterate.
Watch religious nuts flip out over this... they can't even get over a Starbucks cup color change...
...and it makes dumb people mad, which is always fun to see.
...and they never taught us a thing about it at school.  Apparently it was more important to know the power of Jesus. 
Anyone have a couple close second or third place nominations? This is so cool.
Influential in terms of knowledge? Sure. But in terms of what changed the way the world operates, I'd have to go with Das Capital and Communist Manifesto.
How many original copies are there? 
Critique of Pure Reason is the only book that I've read in which I felt, at moments, completely dwarfed by Kant's ideas. Glad to see it gets a high rank.
I think the foreword by Pope Pius IX was a nice touch.
My reading list for the next couple months  
It increased our knowledge and understanding of *who we are* and *where we come from* more than any other book I can think of.
This is a nice little article about the book itself. http://communicatescience.com/zoonomian/2012/01/13/darwins-many-origins/
Duh
No love for the Corpus Hermeticum and the Emerald tablet?
My guess, considering the general public decided, is that the ranking corresponds to which books are the most known. 
darwin's work is built on adam smith's the wealth of nations, nowhere mentioned in this thread. darwin applied smith's ideas about economics to ecology.
Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life.
Do i need to read this book?
Obviously 4chan didn't participate in this vote...
[Ahem.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rerum_natura)
Fundamentally important to biology and destroying all credibility of religion in the meantime. That sounds about right.
What about the Bible? /s
All 20 are on the shelf across the room from my desk. Charles Lyell's 'Principals of Geology' gave Darwin the time frame for Evolution, which he acknowledges many times... My first edition is behind glass, copy on computer.
Religious people be like:

"I disagree, my book was much more scientific than Darwins."
This is why Darwin is the Father of Evolutionary Biology. Through his rigorous evidence gathering, methodological approach, and well defined parameters for experimentation, he took the study of life out of the philosphic realm into a scientific disciplinary.
Oooooo creationists finna be pissseddddd.
It can't be true the bible says otherwise. And we know the bible is true, cause it says it is. And the bible wouldn't lie. Cause it's the holy word of god. No not that god, the one TRUE god. 

Edit : ya I'm trolling, a little. I know some people who think this is perfectly logical. 
You can also add Obedience to authority, a book scarier than it intended to be.
Plus there is mention of a "poop cabin" a bunch of times in there. So theres that
I prefer Newton's "Principia" but what are you going to do?
Darwin and I come from the same town, which is pretty cool.
My grandfather would be so pissed off. Not religious, but he thinks the competitive interpretation of evolution is oversimplified and fails to explain a variety of natural phenomenon.

First experience was with the cichlids of lake malawi. It is one of the most species diverse concentrated areas, but much of the life there is symbiotic in extremely complicated fashions rather than competitive.

After studying that late and co-writing the text on the species and their unique interactions, he came to study and administer the Bay of Fundy herring fisheries. In his studies there, he found evidence of pheromone based school comnunication which allowed for response times and coordination to a level which is comparable/essentially the behaviour of a collective organism.

It seems to me like the pure competitive model was/is a first step in the door to understanding evolution. 
Principia Mathematica wan't even on their list to vote for. That is a Massive oversite and I think invalidates this. 
Principia mathematica was more influential 
If only Academia could also embrace the long view for research. I understand how hard that is so please don't get me wrong.Yet, Academics definitely distinguish between nations - let me interrupt myself and mention Paul Davies. Why did a distinguished Physicist go to a smallish middling Australian University?

The reasoning is inidcative of the problems Academics face. He didn't want to go to America at that point because the research cycle is so short, the need to publish so great that it compromised his research. European universities on the other hand apparently had such levels of bureaucracy that also interfered with his potential to undertake research. Australia was merely a mid-point. 
"Nature, if I may be allowed to personify the natural preservation or survival of the fittest, cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they are useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole  machinery of life".... Mr. Darwin, that was simply beautiful 
"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."

To give its full title. 
One of the rare instances I wish I could upvote and upvote and upvote...
Newton's book on calculus doesn't matter?  What about the theory of relativity? Afaik there were others before Darwin... 
I would have voted for Sein Und Zeit, by Heidegger. But On the origin of species is obviously an excellent choice.
Whoever made this judgement must not have seen the 1996 edition of Playboy
ITT: People comparing Darwin to Newton, because Newton is obviously more influential.
This is the "good book" we need, not some ancient nonsense from ignorant shit-peddlers :)
They mean "most influential other than Aristotle's works," right?
I can't wait for the sequel, *"The End of it All: From Pet Rocks to the Kardashian Sisters"*
Sad to think that if it were written today; it would be locked behind a paywall.  
While it is an important academic book and a big impact, it still is nowhere near the influence and impact that the Bible and Jesus's teachings have had on humankind. 
Excellent!  ... and of course the Bible would have to rate as the most popular book of fiction ever written too! :)
"a book which has changed the way we think about everything"

that's a stretch.  The Origin of Species did not invent the spirit of the Enlightenment (if that's what they mean by this)
Two words, Principia Mathematica.
Just reading the title makes me happy *beyond belief*.
[deleted]
Even in the US? Wow. I thought it would be "How to deep fry a twinkie 101".
Maybe not according to a republican front runner.    
What about the bible, huehuehuehuehue
&gt;the public was asked to vote

i stopped right about there
I'm real happy for you Charles and I'll let you finish, but Principia Mathematica had the best music video of all times
OF ALL TIMSE.

This shows the horrible lack of science education amongst the general public these days.  Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica is FAR more important to our daily lives.
What about "Of Pandas and People"?
Whether they want to admit it or not, Alfred Wallace is to Nikola Tesla as Charles Darwin is to Thomas Edison. And until they recognize that, people will never fully understand the importance of evolutionary discovery.
disrupting safe spaces since 1859
"a book which has changed the way which we make false assumptions about everything and naively base political ideologies off of for our own gain." 
this should be in /r/books, not /r/worldnews.
I was gonna write something lengthy about this..but then I actually went to the link (yeah, I know) and the public picked these out so of course On the Origin of Species is voted the most influential. They also have 1984 on the top 20 as well smh

The answer is De Rev. De Rev is the most influential academic book ever written since it was that first blow to humanity that hit really hard. On the Origin of Species is only as powerful because by the time it came out there weren't that many other things that could dent our egos. We already found out we weren't the center of the universe, and that earth wasn't that special and that our moon wasn't that special...and that there wasn't some kind of godlike matter out in the universe that held everything together. So all that was left to really send the point home was that we, as individuals, aren't nearly as special as we think we are. That's On the Origin of Species.

But the fact that De Rev isn't even on the top 20 list...it's a damn shame. The list in the link just seems like a high school list because 1984 should **not** be on there. But since no one can probably actually read De Rev (I know I sure as hell can't) I guess it makes sense why it's not there...but I know for a fact it's more influential than Origins.
No, it's the most influential academic book ever written because, as Richard Dawkins said, "Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist."
Ive read some starcraft fan fiction that was really good too, but I don't think it counts as a book.
But Darwin was associated with Hitler! Kirk Cameron told me so.
Unless you're a fundamental Christian 
Cool story, bro. 
I mean, Aristotle laid out the framework for the ideas 2,000 years ago. .. Give credit where credit is due, nah'm sayin?

Lol downvoted for no reason
Thank god

Darwin has a posse!
BUT WHAT ABOUT JESUS? :(
When are they going to recognize the Bible for being the most influential work of fiction, huh?
How exactly the fuck is this news?

Edit: Don't upset the circlejerk. It's sensitive.
John hurts scene from 'The Proposition' comes to mind.

Amen. 
&gt; a list of the top 20 academic books was pulled together by expert academic booksellers, librarians and publishers to mark the inaugural Academic Book Week, the public was asked to vote on what they believed to be the most influential.

Just glossing over this bit, are we.
this is gonna sound weird...but I think now that academia is more "mainstream", books are dying.  in the sense that new information is now published in academic journals.  then you have review articles that summarize journals.  and finally, you have books that end up being textbooks that summarize what is known already.
i checked out the list ive read 5/20 go me ^_^
As a pocketbook, Origin of Species is a remarkable text. Easily accessible, well reasoned &amp; while it postulates nothing new, it presents a lifetime of learning into a comprehensible text for those who may never travel or see the world for themselves.
im related to that guy, no shit.
Newton's book was more influential.  
Paradoxically votes about importance also highlight why academi is unforgivably wack.
Imagine if biology was shunned and banned just because of the most important ever written, Principia Mathematica offered many solutions to questions we have ever used.
Voted by who? Why is a centuries old book suddenly news because someone hailed it as something?
It certainly has changed a lot, but for the better? I wonder if it has done anything good. Perhaps the fact that it challenged the establishment makes it a good thing.
Just in: reddit considers a 140 year old book, news!
lol who takes the guardian seriously?
The Bible is clearly the most influencing book
I love studying science. I can pretty much jerk myself off to the title of this article alone.  

*Hnnng. Evolution.*
voted by who? The vote itself doesn't actually mean shit though. People act as if votes are these supreme truths that last eternally.

If you need to demonstrate why academic books matter then you are doing it wrong
this seems like a far better choice for that award. 

http://www.amazon.com/Kim-Kardashian-Selfish-West/dp/0789329204
BUT THE EARTH IS ONLY 4000 YEARS OLD!!!
ITT people respectfully disagree.
Wow sounds like a really good book. Is there a film adaptation?
But ... b ... but what about the bible? /s
Influencing western scientific thought imho:

1. The Bible.(We have an orderly God, so we probably have an orderly universe so scientific thought should work!)

2. Newton's Principia (physics and calculus please and thank you, also influenced by Bible as he was a Christian)

3. Works of Mendel(Christian monk so Bible again)

4. Pick a famous  Chemist

5. Maxwell (hurrah for his equations)

6. Einstien's work

7. Edison, Tesla

8. Salk and vaccines

N. Charlie D and his theory
I can't wait a dozen or so years in the future when ''Why my feelings matter more than reality'' by Stacy McBluehair gets voted too.
Its an important book, but saying it changed the way we think about everything is pretty pretentious.
thx op im uphoric now
too bad modern academic books are held ransom in universities and only made public to those who fork over tuition. who knows what amazing knowledge is stored in the depths of greedy north american universities.
And no doubt held up as a reason why academic publishers should be allowed to screw everyone 

Darwin was the first in a long line of proto-RINO's.
Every field has its "book" that drove the field forward. Its disingenuous to hail one as the most influential academic book ever. Hobbes Leviathan is directly responsible for much of the basis of modern political theory but you don't see it mentioned. I love the Prince but Leviathan is much more deserving. Personally I hate Kant so there's that too. 
I'd have guessed that this would have been a runner up for this category - my first guess would have been A Brief History of Time. Can someone explain why this won over that? Didn't Stephen Hawking's theories revolutionize our understanding of physics, the fundamental science that governs the entire universe? ELI5 anyone?? 
I would submit "Manufacturing Consent" by Noam Chomsky and "A Brief History of Time" by Stephen Hawking as comparably important works, *buuuut*.. okee.
He was the first one to knock the domino down for where we are today, but his actual theories are nothing of what conventional science and evolutionists generally agree on today.
Part of the reason for why it's so great of course is because it reveals God's wonder, His hand at work in the cosmos.
Oh, what's that title in it's entirety again? Something about favored races?
"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life."
Ironically Darwin also called Blacks a lesser species.   It's true.
I still prefer the "why" to the "how".
Seems kind of odd that Philosophae Naturalis Principia Mathematica by Isaac Newton was not mentioned by anyone. It's been my impression that Issaac Newton's theories have held up and been proven over time but Charles Darwin's ideas seem to lack as much credibility. 

And yet I see people everywhere everyday who think humans who evolved on different continents for tens of thousands of years, with all their different challenges, evolved equally intellectually.

I have found most people who believe in human evolution don't necessarily understand it.
The French were the first to call for them to be called Daesh. In particular:

&gt; “I do not recommend using the term Islamic State because it blurs the lines between Islam, Muslims and Islamists. The Arabs call it ‘Daesh’ and I will be calling them the ‘Daesh cutthroats’.”

That was said by the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius back in **September last year**.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-vs-islamic-state-vs-isil-vs-daesh-what-do-the-different-names-mean-9750629.html

Possibly a silly question but how is it pronounced?
A lot of news outlets are quoting an Arabic translator named Alice Guthrie on the origins and meaning behind 'Daesh'.  

[Here is a pretty comprehensive explanation.](https://www.freewordcentre.com/blog/2015/02/daesh-isis-media-alice-guthrie/) 
&gt; The Kurdish militants battling ISIS in Iraq already use the term regularly, though they risk **loosing** their tongues by uttering it.

This bothered me more than it should.

Buncha daeshbags if you ask me
*that'll show 'em*
Why can't we just call them The Shrimp Dicked Pig Fucking State? I guarantee you'd see their numbers drop.  And whenever we mention them we precede it with, after fucking their cousins. 
For example CNN right now says ISIS threatens DC.

"The Shrimp-Dicked Pig Fucking State, after fucking their cousins, threatens DC" 
more like Stan DARSH!!!
Good--the Egyptian goddess deserves to have her name removed from the mud.
#daesh nuts
Click to find out the one weird trick that isis members hate!
I would support this more if I knew how to pronounce it.
From the article Daesh can, in Arabic mean:

"a bigot who imposes his view on others.” 

Sounds pretty fucking accurate to me.
It's annoying to hear world leaders call them 'ISIL' when nobody else calls them that. It's ISIS or Daesh.
Was this not considered by Reddit just yesterday as "cringe"?
My guess is that ISIS finds it funny that their targets are arguing over what to call them.

Good news:  Everyone knows what you're talking about if you say "ISIS" so nobody needs to change anything.  
Kind of childish
Pigfuckers would be more effective, if you ask me.
I was thinking today about all the devilish games the Brits devised during WWII. I think the Western media should go on a propaganda blitz calling into question the manhood of men who can only gain the attention of a female via coercion. 

They could hold up a teeny tiny penis and say, mais oui, this is all that is left of the suicide bomber. Not much to the man to begin with. n'est pas?
great, our world leaders are in Kindergarden
Arab here. ISIS doesn't "hate" Daish. They just don't prefer it. They'd rather you called them Islamic State.

Daish is just an acronym for Dawlet Al-Islamiya (fi) Iraq (wa) SHam.

This literally translates to Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (or technically, Greater Syria, the Levant). 
How about we just call them CUNT and be done with it. Caliphate of Unhinged Neanderthal Twats. 

I apologize to the Neanderthals. I just couldn't think of anything else for N.
Wow the paid propagandists on reddit really want ISIS to be called daesh...

There is so much propaganda on reddit that it is laughable. Reddit is now a propaganda platform for the media/propaganda companies now. So sad...
This shit again? The media pushed this same fucking theory months ago. It wasn't true then and it isn't true now.

IS, I mean Daesh, doesn't care. 
Is it me, or are these cowards easily offended? 
Isn't this what they actually call themselves? 


EDIt: its what Arabs call them. 



"The Arabic for this, al-Dawla al-Islamiya fil ’Iraq wal-Sham, can be abbreviated to Daesh, just as the Palestinian group Hamas (which means "zeal") is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or Islamic Resistance Movement. Daesh is the name that has widely stuck among Arabs, although the group’s own members call it simply the State, al-Dawla, for short,"

Check out this one trick Islamists HATE!
The French government and media have been calling them Daesh since 2014: http://m.france24.com/en/20140917-france-switches-arabic-daesh-acronym-islamic-state
People that think this will have an effect on people that are happily raping and murdering people are just adorable..

You aren't making a difference, you are just finding excuses to do nothing.
Oh my God ! They really did that? That's crazy!! I'm sure Daesh is trembling in fear now. Good job western leaders!!
An Egyptian Goddess is happy for this development.
"Daesh" is simply just arabic for ISIS. They don't hate it, because it is there actual name. Its the same as calling Spain "España." 
Waiting for tomorrow's headline: "World leaders tricked into calling ISIS "Daesh" by asshole arabic translator"
This is fucking stupid, Daesh means exactly the same thing DAESH is the arab acronym for Doula Islamya al-Eraq wa al-Sham, which means Islamic State
Dear Infidels,

You may have heard of the recent rebranding campaign trying to turn our Islamic State Organization, which you know better as ISIS or ISIL, as "Daesh".


Please be assured, we have not changed our branding in any way and we are still very much in the business of terrorizing innocents of the free world under the guise of religion and revenge. 

However, We have begun expanding to new territories and we are looking forward to opening new franchises in a city near you. Allah willing, we will announce our arrival and Grand Opening in your city with a bang very soon!

In closing, when it comes to murder, corrupting the words of the Koran and targeting all non-Muslims and non-extremist Muslims for violent deaths intended to shock and exploit the news cycle - accept no substitutes. Ask for the Original Islamic State. Ask for ISIS or ISIL.

Remember, If it isn't ISIS, it isn't terror!

Allahu Akbar,

Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi


Caliph of ISIS


Assistant Manager, Aleppo Toyota






When I first read the Koran in Samsun Turkey at the Blue Mosque in 1959. I was told by the instructor that full beards were only allowed after you reached the age of 35. In that way, one could see who has the wisdom of age. ISIL is full of little boys with full beards pretending to be someone with wisdom and knowledge. A good spanking is in order, a word is not sufficient.
Stop trying to make Daesh a thing.  It's not going to happen.
Daesh is a weasel word to avoid using the term "islamic" so the intelligence services can maintain the dangerous fiction that pretending Islamist fascism has nothing to do with Islam will prevent bigotry and stop muslims turning to jihadism.

This is dangerous and wrong. It was wrong when they said it to george bush after 9/11 and they have not been able to climb down from this wrong position since despite its obvious failure.

To hell with saudi arabia. We should be standing together with secular muslims against islamist fascism. We should be banning sharia within our borders. We should declare war on the Caliphate - not islamic state the group but  the geographic entity of the Caliphate to which many groups have pledged allegiance.

We should prosecute for treason those who promote the caliphate within our borders.

We should also ban the sharia-promoting money that is rolling in to educational institutions, religious schools, mosques and think tanks from saudi arabia. The enemy is within.

And they are fundamentally Islamic. This is a religious failure. To pretend otherwise is a dangerous lie that prevents effective action.

Here is what the Caliphate is about -- excellent article from The Atlantic 

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/
which is funny because I always see it as ISIS in the media.

I think its too bad that they ruined the word "Isis". Isis was an ancient egyptian goddess.. It was such a cool name for the spy agency on Archer too. It would make a cool name for a giant solar power plant, or something in Las Vegas. Because of the connotations of something in the desert, per the egyptian reference.

But nope, its ruined now. Like the swastika, a symbol going back way before the nazis.
... and this means Jack Shit.
This seems like when we renamed french fries freedom fries
WE DID IT REDDIT!!!
Finally our world leaders are taking serious steps in order to fight off ISIS.

Wait, I mean Daesh. 
Daesh nuts!
They misspelled "douche".
Fucking finally. Now we can get a badass Egyptian goddess name back.
Daeshbags
This news is about 4 years old
Are they seriously using Harry Potter bollocks to fight terrorists?
"We're going to go after Daesh wherever they are" "Who?" "ISIS"
Thank God. I always liked the name Isis. :(
Non-story
Daeshbags is a better term.
Last time I used the term a bunch of pro-Daesh Redditors (yes, they exist) started sending me very angry comments about how "offensive" the word is to them.

So, I've been using the world liberally.  They can go screw themselves, and I'm glad to hear that they don't like the word.  Get fucked, **Daesh**.
*Dae-*

*Daesh?*

*Daeshman?*

*Daeshman!*  **(uhh-AAh-ahh)**
This will daesh their hopes of ever getting any respect if you ask me.
Daesh Nuts.....got 'em!
Now Archer can go back to working for ISIS
how about we call them المشتعلة المتسكعون (flaming assholes)
Politicians have been calling them ISIS, ISIL, and Daesh. The media has been a huge disappointment in explaining this idiocy. 

But did they change their  profile pictures on Facebook? 
What a load of crap - Daesh= al dawla al islamiya fi iraq wa sham. Which means "Islamic state in Iraq and levant" in Arabic. To be exact they called themselves dawlat al Islam all along while the west translated it to ISIS
Let's use some common sense here folks. The stated reason they hate the name Daesh is because it us an arabic acronym for the Arabic name of ISIS. ISIS is the same thing in English. Basically they are cutting people's tongues out for saying ISIS instead of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria.

This is such non-news and such an empty gesture.

It'd be the same as me saying I'll kill you for calling me Phil instead of Philip. Then you, thousands of miles away behind many layers of security saying Phil! Neeener neener!
So....lets confuse the public?

Just stick with something damn it. Call them the wandering desert pig fuckers or something. Just stick with something!
This is the diplomatic equivalent of changing your profile picture to a French flag. 
Daesh literally means ISIS in Arabic. I don't know who started this bullshit but it's completely false.
Daesh is the Arabic word - ISIS refers to itself by that. It predates ISIS even. 
They kill 130 people and we retaliate by changing our facebook pictures and calling them names.

I don't think we can win this guys.
THIS is exactly what I've always thought the first step should be. Stop calling any such group by the name they want you to call them by. Fuck them. ISIS is neither islamic nor a state nor do they represent Iraq or Syria. The Taliban should not be called the taliban (which means students). The same goes for pretty much all of these bastards. They use a name that has NOTHING to do with their ideology. 

I live in Pakistan and there are alot of different extremist groups. No one likes them. The only support they get is on the basis of thier name. People too illiterate to know better go do this shit. 

An analogy would be for an extremist organization such as the KKK or Neo-Nazi calling themselves The foundation of true american peace-keepers or something. If they were called that, alot people would go, wow that name suggests these guys are actually the good guys. 


Can't we just all agree to call them the massive cockwombles?
That's actually what they're called in Hebrew: da'ash
Ni! Ni! Ni! NI!!! NI NI! NI! NI! NIII NI NI!
I'd rather world leaders fight harder instead of resorting to calling them names. 
I always thought this was the PC way to distance the group known as the Islamic State from Islam.
Call them Alqeda (sp?) itll piss both of them off.
If ISIS hates Daesh/Daash so much then why did they name their official twitters Daaesh, DaaeshConnect, DaeshReloaded, DaaeshConnect1, etc.? Because they don't. People just want to say "Islam has nothing to do with the Islamic State!"

http://pastebin.com/d8ND4rvV


"Freedom Fries".
Does this mean I can wear Archer merchandise again?
This won't change until the 24 hour news outlets start using the term also

The BBC's mandated name for ISIS is: "so-called Islamic State", the emphasis being on the assumption that their actions have no basis in Islamic jurisprudence. 
I get that words can hurt but I'm pretty sure we should be using sticks and stones against those guys. 
Everyone knows them as ISIS. When I hear DOD peeps say 'ISIL' it drives me mad. 'Daesh' is just more confusing.
Ya know what they hate worse? Titan II missiles. 
Stan Darsh
Perhaps an unpopular view, but I hope news sources continue to refer to them as Islamic State (IS is an appropriate abbreviation), which is their correct and appropriate name.

I do not want my news sources to be bias.  I do not want them to choose a name just because the group hates it.  It's propaganda if you ask me.  They should not refer to the group as ISIS, ISIL or Daesh.  Islamic State is the name of the group and it's appropriately referred to as such by reputable news sources in the UK and in the Wall Street Journal.  The New York Times also seems to be coming around, but still, many US news sources are slow to catch on.  I hope other news sources follow suit.
Fuck. I was just getting used to saying ISIS instead of Al-Qaeda, and that one took months for me to get used to.
Google should pop up "Did you mean *daesh*?" whenever anyone searches for ISIS.
"...Risk __loosing__ their tongues..."    
"...__loosing__ their tongues..."    
"...__loosing__ their..."    
"...__loosing__..."    
__LOOSING__


What name in arabic do they prefer to be called? ISIS is english.
&gt;loosing
I don't know where they came under the impression that ISIS hates being called Daesh, but I've heard from many people it's not true at all... 

Either way, what kind of backwards attempt at mental warfare is this? We wanna hurt their feelings by calling them names? 

Piss then off huh? That seems like a smart idea.
Billions of dollars in military spending and they've resorted to name calling.
"loosing"
We called the bad guys in WWII "Krauts" and "Japs".  This isn't any different.  They should consider themselves lucky they aren't being called ragtops on TV.
reddit is daesh
Move Over, Islamic State Terrorists

M.O.I.S.T.

They all just shuddered to death. You're welcome!
Ummmm.... Isn't this old news?
"in other news, Poland has accidentally declared war on the sovereign state of Ireland. After the messup was revealed, the Polish Prime Minister gave an apology, saying "I'm sorry, I thought we were angry at Irish, not ISIS."'
Good, I liked it better when Isis was an Egyptian goddess.
This passive aggression WILL NOT STAND
But did they change their  profile pictures on Facebook? 
Huh, I would think ISIS should be extremely irritating to those monotheists as that acronym is also the name of a pagan Egyptian goddess. Should keep using that, too. ;3
Why don't they just call them "pig testicles" in Arabic?  Can't get any more insulting than that.
ISIS is a bunch of Daeshbags.
maybe world leaders should take to them being called "targets" instead.
So IsIs members are Daeshbags?
Can we start calling them Doush instead? 
Stopped reading after they misspelled "losing".
I personally would hate getting shot or bombed more.
Sounds like something America would've started.
[deleted]
I'm just gonna stick with fuck faces. Meaning one that likes to have his face fucked. Hopefully by a GBU of some sort
Except that it's untrue, Daesh (داعش) means the exact same thing as ISIS, but why let facts get in the way of doing nothing and declaring an easy victory?  
How about actually doing something that will matter?   How about arming the Kurds?  How about only allowing young Muslim men as refugees if they are with family?  How about changing the immigration policy that has left Europe entirely flooded with Islamists that are hiding in wait to slaughter their people?


No? That's racist?  Well I can't wait to hear what you think of Asians, because they don't even like immigrants who are of the *same* race.  But I can tell you that Asians are watching in horror as Europe commits suicide, watching as Europeans would rather condemn their people to slaughter than be called a bigot for daring to use reason.
So they're now taking the "na na na na naa naa" approach..
YOU P(in)C BRO!?
That'll teach them.
That'll work too. can we call them The Shrimp Dicked Pig Fucking State?
I'm all for this purely so I can feel safe wearing my Isis band shirt in public once again.
Perfect. Leave ISIS to Archer.
It stands for ISIL in arabic

**Da**wla - Nation or State

Islamiya - Islamic

Fil **I**raq - In Iraq

Wal **Sh**aam - and the Levant

Together the letters I highlighted would be pronounced Da'esh



How we fight terror: we call you mean names.
Yeah, because when you call somebody by a name they don't like that makes them give up. Just like each and every american is crippled by the fact that you are called "infidel".  I mean just reading the word "infidel" makes americans shrivel into a whimpering ball...right? Calling them by that name will make the northern half of Iraq no longer sunni muslims repressed by a Shia puppet regime. Therefore this will make them stop fighting for their own space to exist. Excellent plan World leaders!  This will make them willing to be the serfs of international banks and american corporations in no time. They make them give you all of their resources. Congratulations you have won!
Yes, because calling a group of people a name they hate is the best way to solve problems :/
That'll show 'em!
We did it, reddit!
Guess Obama saw the duck on here.
"You'll never guess what one trick is really pissing off ISIS"
Is the proper pronunciation "day-ash" or "deesh"? 
Obligatory "We did it, Reddit!"
It's important for the world to call them Islamic State to the United States so they can keep making their population against Muslims in general in order to perpetuate war.
Wasn't Daesh the name of Bourne's supposed counterpart in the Bourne Ultimatum movie? 
Don't waste your time reading thousands of comments! Daesh is an acronym for ISIS in Arabic! It has no other meaning, and is pronounced how you read it!
I have no idea how daesh is pronounced but I do know how ISIS is pronounced so I will most likely keep calling them ISIS. I guess I am a terrible person. 
I'm sure they don't care. They are not 13yrs old. They are a death cult. When someone doesn't agree with you, you expect them to call you a bigot.
Let the the international trolling commence.
Terrorist organization takes responsibility for killing hundreds of people so we call them mean names.... Am I missing something?
Wow, they murder innocent people and we call them mean names. That'll show them for sure. 
I feel like debating on what ISIS should or should not be called is vastly less important than actually dealing with the problem. And I'm not talking about the occasional airstrike here and there, I'm talking about an all out ground offensive. Crush these cowardly ants first and then the world can decide what to call them after the fact.
So is this a war of words? If the US ordered all domestic media to start calling Isis Daesh would that help? Ppl would still call it isil/isis
Beating ISIS with a different name is like beating cancer with Facebook likes.

They responded with " Call me what you want, just don't call me late for a jihad."  
A bit late in the game
That's how everybody says it here in israel... But that's probably becouse a fair amount of us speak arabic anyway
When you try to start a Caliphate and everyone with an iPhone leaves on foot.  #justdaeshthings
The Russians just admitted that "Daesh", also known as the Islamic State, took down their plane killing 224 Russian citizens. But no, you are right, South Sudan and Palestine are more of a country that IS..., time to grow up and accept reality.
Yeah let's call them names, that'll stop 'em.
Yeah, let's piss them off even more, cause that can only lead to good things /s
Chip their egos and call them Daesh

That's what ISIS really hates! 
Haha...daeshbags 
I would call them dogs instead, and use a picture of a chihuhua instead of the ISIS flag on TV. 
Why would they hate it if they refer to themselves as Daech. ISIS is just the literal translation, DA3ICH is just a short for Dawlate al islam fi lgharbi wa sham which means Islamic state in the East and Sham.
It does more to legitimize ISIS by calling them Daesh.
This is what the Kurds have been calling them for a while now. Probably because they hate it.
Every time I tried "Daesh" in a /r/worldnews title, it got ignored. If I used ISIS, it got up-voted, a quick look at today's /r/worldnews and its obvious no one is using Daesh.

and I know a hippy chick called Isis, who isnt happy about it either!
God, this is such bollocks haha.
Ah the ole "you can kill our people but we'll call you a bad name" play.
Daesh (داعش) is an Arabic acronym. It is exactly like ISIL, but in Arabic 
I actually really like this because:

a) It detaches them from regular muslims

b) It denies them the title of their own state

c) It denies them any claim to the lands of Syria and Iraq and their people

d) They don't like it
IS is Islamic State which implies they are a state which they must certainly are not.  Darshan is a much better description and as a benifit, they dislike the term. 
"a bigot who imposes his view on others." That seems about right
[Muslim reformer Maajid Nawaz on "Daesh vs ISIS"](https://twitter.com/MaajidNawaz/status/665667578132496385)
All this dancing around terminology, between ISIS, IS, ISIL and Daeish really doesn't do or accomplish anything. 

As others have mentioned, Daeish really means the exact same thing as the other names they have been called. Also, the entire ideal of ISIS is to instil hatred and fear in the west. Does changing our terminology to more potential offensive name stop this? No. This kind of reaction just furthers the fact that they are getting to us. 
Saying Daesh instead of ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, is just a way for Obama to avoid associating Islam with Islamic terrorism, which he is loathe to do as an apologist for the Muslim world, and to avoid bringing Iraq and Syria to the public's mind, as these are two of his greatest failures. 
Politically correct bullshit. Daesh is promoted as the new name, in order to blur the line between ISIS and Islam, even though ISIS is an Islamist organization based on a very literal understanding of Islamic texts. It's fucking nonsensical. 
That will TOTALLY show them.

Lets not be against, islam, lets just use a dumb word to meaninglessly piss off muslims that can't technically get any more pissed off than they already are.  If that group is already putting 100% effort into killing non-muslims and attacking the west, nothing you say means anything.  Talk about them or don't talk about them, words don't matter, they don't care.

You either start closing borders, deporting all non-citizens from that region, and closing mosques, or you sit back and watch them attack over and over again.
Except they don't hate it, that was all made up.
This is so dumb. smh
Doesn't seem that derogatory of a term, just way sensitive audience.
DAESHIT CRAZY!
Daesh is literally just the abbreviation of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria in Arabic. 
It's about time Western leaders have finally learned how to really combat ISIS. It has to be done on a theological level as much as it's done from a military level.
https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2014/10/09/words-matter-isis-war-use-daesh/V85GYEuasEEJgrUun0dMUP/story.html
This is so stupid honestly to use middle school level tactics on a terrorist group. 
Censorship be damned we should call them what John Oliver called them last night.  Fucking Assholes.
D.A.E.SH is a transliteration of the Arabic acronym formed of the same words that make up I.S.I.S in English: 'Islamic State in Iraq and Syria', or 'al-dowla al-islaamiyya fii-il-i'raaq wa-ash-shaam'.

Depending on how it is conjugated in Arabic, the word can mean "to trample down and crush." But it can also mean "an ignorant bigot." ISIS has reportedly threatened to cut out the tongues of anyone it hears using the term.

It's a derogatory term, like referring to Germans and Japanese as 'Krauts' and 'Japs'.
If you just say ‘Daesh’ — go on, try it out for yourself — you can’t hear the word ‘Islam’ in it at all. We could be talking about terrorists who were denominationally Methodists, or Rosicrucians. Perhaps we should also stop saying the word Islam when we refer to other manifestations of the religion which we do not like. Such as al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab and Boko Haram. Pretend they are not Muslim at all. Extend it to those Islamic countries which oppress women and put homosexuals to death. Because it’s not just Isis, is it? Stop referring to Saudi Arabia and Iran and Egypt and Pakistan and countless other countries as being Islamic — and pretty soon, problem solved! No more Islam anywhere, except here at home in Europe, of course.



I'am ok with the name Islamic State. It just sounds more genuine. Daesh sounds more like you want to hide something...
And then "nanananabooboo"

Good work, all.
I say we call them by what they really are, pedophile rapists.
For the love of fucking god, do we have fifth graders running the world? I mean, really.

You think ISIS/ISIL/Daesh actually give a rats ass what westerners or opponents are calling them? Calling them Daesh isn't going to anger them and have them ramp up beheadings, and calling them ISIS isn't going to appease them any single bit.

You could quite honestly start calling them "Hippity hoppity good times drunk monkey dancers" and they'd still be trying to kill everyone just the very fucking same amount as always.
Because the way we defeat the Islamic State is...calling them names? 

This whole "daesh" thing is stupid and cringy and I'm not going to participate in indulging the idiotic, self-aggrandizing fantasy that calling them names on the internet actually does anything. 
It's not a word they hate. It's the Islamic version of ISIS.

/u/idonotknowwhoiam is an idiot.
This is not newsworthy.
This should stamp them out

When drone strikes and ground offences don't work, we resort to the way of our ancestors. Sticks and stones.
I think they'd hate it even more if we're not talking about them at all. Hopefully, one day ... Sadly, I just can't see it right now.

Well that'll stop them right in their tracks! Pffft

Pretty damned depressing. The whole place has an abandoned, post-apocalyptic feel to it.  It almost looks like a set piece from a movie or video game.  If you move around you'll see more animals in decaying, concrete enclosures.
They should bring the elephant to: http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/ 

It's basically a resort for abused elephants and it's being run by a thai woman and supported by lots of volunteers. It's a beautiful location where elephants can actually be elephants.

Support that place if you care about the future of elephants in south east asia
That's how almost every elephant in Japan lives. Japanese zoos are depressing
This is depressing indeed. I was in [Kathmandu zoo](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g315764-d373467-Reviews-The_Central_Zoo-Patan_Lalitpur_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html) and even if they do not have a lot of money and resources they are doing great job in trying to keep the animals to as close to natural habitat as possible. This should really be a lesson for zoo administrator.
can't even finish the article :/ in Pittsburgh zoo there's a polar bear that is going back and forth and moves his head.. kids think it's dancing for them. so depressing.  
&gt;At 68 years old, Hanako is the oldest elephant in Japan. She's spent the past six decades at Tokyo's Inokashira Park Zoo, where she lives alone in a barren enclosure. There's no grass or trees — only concrete floors and walls. It's unclear when she last saw another elephant. 
Humans can sometimes be fucking dickheads
Man, growing up going to the San Diego Zoo made me think all zoos were up to that standard. It was soul crushing to find out the truth. 
I recently visited a zoo (my last visit was 3 decades ago) and it was very depressing to see animals in such small enclosures.  Lions, bears, monkeys, etc.  I know they are fed and cared for, but they still felt lonely and subject to slavery in their four walls.  Would love to see more open concept zoos (almost like a safari) without too many concrete.  
It breaks my heart when i saw that video
I've seen Hanako twice, a year apart. Both times she stood in the same place, swaying like that. Poor old thing. Her enclosure is TINY and at the edge of the park. You can actually see residential homes over the concrete walls of her pen. 
Unpopular opinion:  Put her down.

She's Old, violent, probably in pain, probably won't be able to rehabilitate her to ever socialize with other elephants.

These people are assholes for keeping an animal in conditions like this.
This is sick. I hope she is sent to an open space, probably a wildlife sanctuary in India, there are a lot of them with with lots of resources and space for elephants in India.
Ueno zoo is fucking horrible. I walked around for an hour before leaving the place, depressed and disgusted. That's the last time I'll ever visit a zoo
I saw this elephant over the summer and it ruined my day. It was the worse 400¥ I spent, being from Canada and assuming all westernized nations would run their zoos in a similar manner I thought it was way too cheap,  it clearly is because the "habitats" were like prison cells. The zoo had either way to many animals per cage or not enough for the animals.  3/10 wouldn't go again 
Signed the petition. It's not much but took 10 seconds, go do it
It can be done so much better with just a little effort.
[Prague zoo Elephant enclosure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Prague_Zoo_-_elephant_cage.jpg)

    And "with her increasing age she has become more temperamental," the outlet reported.    

No it's because you've kept her in a concrete cell for decades you morons.
Hey people saying this is how Japan treat animals, I live in Japan and recently went to Itozu no Mori, the elephants have a large enclosure with plenty of grass and attention - http://i.imgur.com/zZ4tzs6.png

So maybe don't general- ...oh wait it's Reddit.
Im sure by this time he is completely insane. You are not depressed for 61 years, you are fucking bonkers.
Elephants can't get a break, man.
And when *I* get depressed about living in a concrete cell, they tell me it's just a chemical imbalance.
I've only signed like 2 petitions in my entire 40 yrs of life.  This is one of them.
I'm spoiled by the Columbus zoo (as are the animals).  There is so much room.  I can't imagine...
They should lock the owners in a concrete cell for 61 years and see how they feel about it.
Japanese people treating animals inhumanely. Nothing new there.
fucking cunts
everyone that is outraged, please extend your consideration towards other less 'awe-inspiring' animals like chicken and cows. millions of them are right now trapped in cages and enclosures hardly be able to move destined to live their short life miserable and in pain all for our love for fried chickens and milks. (refer to Earthlings for more).

me, I would not stop eating KFC.
Please please get him into a better enclosure!

(Wildlife park)


Fuck Zoos man.

Standing ogling exotic animals should be a thing of the past with nature documentaries and the internet.

Wanna see an elephant? Satisfy yourself with videos till you can go on a responsible safari where they live.

Don't stick them in a little box for your fucking amusement.
Tragic!

:(
Imagine how futuristic everything will seem when she gets out.
I've seen a lot of shit on reddit, but this kind of thing pulls at the strings more than most of it.
This literally almost made me throw up.

jesus fucking christ get him out!
"She was there to replace the zoo's previous elephants, who had been starved to death during World War II under orders from the Tokyo governor."

What the f
If the concrete cell didn't cure his depression in the first couple years, I am not sure why they thought 61 years would do the trick. 
This is why I greatly dislike zoos. It must be a nightmare for large animals.
Japan treating animals like shit? What a shocker.
Well, this just ruined my otherwise good morning. Thanks. 
thanks for making me depressed!
There are no good zoos anywhere in the world for elephants (or other animals). They belong in the wild, in guarded sanctuaries, with their families.
Nobody show this article to the gay swan lady...
this is how we keep our severely depress people in america!

Signed petition.
Has anyone reached out to Bob Barker? 
What can I do??!?  I hate news like this because I feel so helpless.
Why has nobody in the past 61 years done anything? Why did this go unnoticed for so long? 
"Elephant released from prison after 61 years experiences what it is like to travel to the elephant future."
Great. Another post reaffirming my hate in the human species
Being able to see animals is neat, but fuck, Zoo's are inhumane.   Humans are supposed to be intelligent, yet we treat each other and animals like crap.   Go figure.
Holy shit this is depressing. No creature deserves this sort of punishment. 
This is fucking repulsive. 

There is no way I could not sign that petition.
This hurts my heart.

This is sad as fuck. What the fuck are we doing
Terrible.  I think if I were in her position and cognizant at all of the situation, I would want to be euthanized
Does anyone else here get tears in their eyes when they see stuff like this? Human beings are despicable.   
Good god, that is a truly awful and cruel.
I'm not usually one to get too emotional or anything over animals. But looking at that really pissed me the FUCK off... Why the fuck are we treating animals like that. The fact that we can make an elephant. One of the kindest and most reserved animals in the whole gotdamn world depressed really angers me inside man... I fucking love elephants and this hit a nerve..
This seriously makes me want to cry. I want to lock all those fuckers in a in a cage with a nothing but a little piece of rope for 61 years!!!!!

 
Lets break her out!
Lets so the same to the zookeepers.
We suck 
I fear that if the elephant gets released to a sanctuary, she will injure or kill more people - no matter how careful they are with her. 

Just because she is free doesn't mean 60+ years of devastating psychological effects will magically disappear.  
True but Japanese zoos are worse than most in the western world.
[The petition link should be on the top. Please sign!](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/pt-br/takeaction/743/826/456/)
I want to cry, just why...why....why? Fuck man whats wrong with us we've turned our back on a lot of things haven't we 
This...well now I am going to be angry and sad all day long.

Even when zoo's  try to make living conditions as enriched as they can, a prison is still a prison. This poor girl has been in solitary for 60 years.
Yeah I'm not clicking on this. 
I really dislike most zoos, as most animals are too sociable and intelligent to be kept in cages. I do like drive-through style zoos with big open fields, such as [this one near me](http://m.lionsafari.com). It just feels better when it is the people in cages, and the animals roam free, with acres and acres to themselves. 
This is just absolutely horrible. Even watching the video from 2013 was depressing. Just wrong. Fuck Japan zoos after reading comments here.

&gt; A 2011 article by national paper Asahi Shimbun says that Hanako had flipped a keeper, threw a veterinarian and chased a staffer in the previous five years.

I don't blame her.
This made me so fucking sad. This is the saddest thing I've seen on Reddit in a while. 
The one zoo I visited in Japan made me feel pretty crappy. Every creature there seemed miserable. The polar bear's coat was tinted greenish blue from the chemicals in it's little pool. Every animal seemed despondent and the whole zoo was mostly just concrete. 

It must have been a miserable place to work. In general, Japan seems to have less of a focus on ethical treatment of animals from what I saw the couple times I visited.
Jesus Christ, those photos are despair incarnate.  
Sign the petition please &gt; http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/743/826/456/
All zoos are obsolete. 
Fuck the petition.
Lets get a group together, bring sledgehammers and break the damn walls down.
This is disgusting.
I would much rather watch elephants on the discovery channel than like this 
Way to wait 60 years to give a fuck, SJWs
I think she should be put down. She's suffered enough, and just as a human would have readjustment issues in a similar situation, she would too. Maybe the most humane thing to do would be to finally give her the peace she needs.
I live literally 100 meters from this zoo in Inokashira park. Every year I buy the yearly pass and see Hanako about once a month. Next time I go there I'll tell the keeper about this petition. I do feel a little sad for Hanako but she is a symbol of Kichihoji and the people here love her. They tell me that nobody really knows how many more years she is expected to live.

Like nearly every building in Japan, it is horribly outdated and outstyled.
Wtf. I swear if I had iron man money, the brains to build a suit and the balls not to be drugged by the cia so they could steal said suit then they would be getting a visit from me...
A lot of zoos keep their elephants like this, unfortunately.
Cries. I signed the petition.
Fucking disgusting.
I couldn't finish reading the article. It just broke my heart. I've signed the petition.  Hopefully it works and gets this elephant sent somewhere nice where she can finally roam safe and free.
For those of you who are feeling a need to do a little bit more than signing the petition, I just wanted to pass this info along:
I just made a modest donation to the [Serengeti Foundation](http://www.serengetiusa.com/how-we-help-in-asia.html). A number of you mentioned the amazing work being done at [Elephant Nature Park](http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/), so I first looked at donating there. However, they [don't directly accept donations](http://www.elephantnaturepark.org/how-you-can-help/funding-policy/), and directed me to [Save Elephant Foundation](http://www.saveelephant.org/) which appears to be the fundraising side of ENP. They are a Thai based charity, and you can donate there, or like me, via their partner, the [Serengeti Foundation](http://www.serengetiusa.com/how-we-help-in-asia.html) which is a 501(c)(3) US tax deductible charitable organization, and states that "100 percent of your donation will go to the cause of your choice." 
I included links to the article and this comments section with my donation, but included the acknowledgement that the money would likely be best spent to support their ongoing efforts. 
Just wanted to pass it along in case anyone else finds themselves in the same gut-wrenching boat as me after that article. 
What the hell is wrong with Japan?
While I was in Japan I went to the Osaka Aquarium. Didn't feel that bad to me, but i honestly don't have any comparison to what other aquariums look like, or how much space certain types of fish need.

On the other hand what really saddened me were Pet Shops.

They cage cats and dogs in these rabbit cages with Plexiglass to look at them. It's horrible, that's not how you treat those animals. That's almost like caged Chickens.

Fucking disgusting
Poor elderphant 
Zoos are depressing as hell for visitors, let alone the poor bastard animals that live in them. 

I know lots of good work goes on in zoos, but this kind of thing is sickening.
People need to start realizing that zoos are animal prisons.

When you are a child, you won't think much about it, but just stop and think about what exactly a zoo is as an adult.

Animals trapped inside boxes


I used to have a very favorable opinion of Japan and her people, but after reading so many articles on their culture regarding the treatment of sentient animals, the annual killing of hundreds of dolphins, the continued whaling practice under the guise of "scientific research", their treatment of dogs and cats - it just breaks my heart they can be so callous and cruel in this respect. So little regard for lives of these beautiful creatures is inhumane at best and should be criminal.
Depressed human is now depressed
Please please get him into a better enclosure!

(Wildlife park)


Alright, Reddit. Let's get this poor creature out of there.
This is why I fucking hate zoos 
Zoos are prisons!
We really are cruel animals.
People are shit!

Too many elephants are forced to live like this. Elephants are social animals and this is just terrible cruelty. Just imagine what the reaction would be if a human being was being treated like this. 
As a dude from a city where this sort of thing was taken care of 30 years ago I have to wonder wtf Japan is thinking. This is pretty appalling. I would've thought Japanese zoos to be much more advanced. This is US zoos in the late 70s.
I'd get depressed too if all I had to look at was gawkers and concrete walls
Reading that made me depressed- I can't imagine paying money to see that it would leave me in tears.
zoos are just a business ... they exist because they make money. period.
Is it just me or does "The DoDo" sound like a Japanese version of the onion
I swear to God some aliens are gonna come down here and judge us on how we treated lower life forms and do the same to us 
How did we, as a species, determine that an individual of another species was depressed?
The skin on that elephant looks really unhealthy....what are they feeding it....
She's Old, violent, probably in pain, probably won't be able to have some freedom of movement.
That's terrible, this why animals should have large habitats that are safe guarded. Support World Wild Life Foundation. If you want to see an elephant face to face take a safari trip to it's native lands. 
Poor thing 
Also, they are locked in a barren enclosure.
save the elephants, cam a few in the wild, put up a screen so the one in the zoo can at least see another of it's kind.  They are so sensitive, also it helps me when I see family, while in I'm hiding from my abusers.  It might help the elephants.  
Oh we really need to not isolate them. 

where i live I avoid the elephant enclosers, they look restless and it looks miserable. There is no peace for zoo elephants, they are made to be out in the public. they need grass and open space.

Why doesn't the zoo get another elephant?! Additionally, [they really need to keep the animals in more natural living conditions.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/e1/23/dc/e123dcb7e5bcfbf1d3ac13c5f3bc916d.jpg)

Wait, what? Why did the Tokyo governor starve the last elephants that were in there to death??
I'm kind of surprised that many of these Redditors who have commented on witnessing the cruelty of zoos in Asia firsthand are expressing surprise at the conditions... I thought that, as an informed citizen in the 21st century, it was common knowledge that you should never fund zoos that have animals in inhumane conditions. STOP visiting these zoos.
Are you sure this is not the life of a typical American spinster? Overweight, lonely and in a concrete jungle (big city)
I can't comprehend what 61 years of "living" like that would feel like 
Uh, the zoo in my mid-sized Tennessee city is 10000% better than this. They have elephants but they have like three or four and a huge outdoor area to roam around with awesome water jets they can play with and ropes to pull and stuff. 

This just seems like literal prison except there's also no one you ever get to talk to. Anyway, there's a petition on that page. I signed it even though I usually don't do that sort of thing. 
Anyone have a working link to sign the petition?  The one on the site isn't working properly on chrome. thanks. 
"Depressed Redditor Has Been Living In A Mental Cage For Too Long"

Starting an armed coalition to free the captured animals across the world.
FUCK JAPAN
I wouldn't mind pairing with a sanctuary setting up a budget for purchase and transfer and trying to kickstart a campaign to buy the elephant from the zoo. 

It seems like a logical point.  How do we do this? Anyone ever do something like this?  What is the first step. Anyone work for a company that does this? Just curious for its feasible. 
First article I read in the morning on Reddit.  Sad :(
There is a petition to sign within the article to help this elephant. We should sign. This is when social media works. Forget the war machines for a day and help this elephant.
This is horrific 
I will never, never understand why some people think it's okay to treat animals like inanimate objects.
This made me angry and sad this morning. Sometimes reddit headlines suck!
I can see the need for animal sanctuaries / animal rehab centers. But zoos? We should just do away with them.
I didn't realize that elephants even lived to be 61.
The cages at Japanese zoos remind me of Mommy Fortuna's traveling show from The Last Unicorn.

A bunch of miserable creatures locked into tiny cages who wouldn't think twice about taking out their handlers if given the chance.

Humans are scum, things like this makes me so sad.
That is horrible. Getting emotional here... How do you do that to an animal? No words.... Just letters...
I'm not one of those hippies who think zoos and sea world are evil. However, I think this is bullshit and I want to give that elephant a hug for the shit she's been through. 
Signed.
The worst part is that they say the aggression wasn't an accident because elephants are intelligent beings and act cognitively. So if they can agree with that to demonize an elephant how can they not recognize the lack of cognitive stimulation they are providing. People are never ready to accept reality if it means they are at fault. Idiots
Jesus, how sad
Bostons primates are on Prozac their so depressed..
I have pictures and video somewhere of our trip there. It was like a glass encapsulated prison. I wouldnt have been suprised one bit to see an ape just banging its head against a wall repeatedly..
And the big cats were equally as depressed looking.
Shit, unrelated, but I can remember going to the Boston Aqurarium back in the late 70's, early 80's and there being a dead seal, jusy floating in the tepid sun, decaying in the tanks they had at the front doors.
Good times at Mass Zoos ;-D
Depressed elephant sounds like the name of a punk rock band
&gt;It's unclear when she last saw another elephant.

That's incredibly sad as they are intelligent and very social animals.  No friends for 60 years would make any animal feel depressed!

Elephants shouldn't be in zoos/circuses/etc., but for that matter we should just move on from zoos being a "thing" and let them fade away.  
On that note, I'm really hoping Sea World is going to die off.
This is so fucked up. I never liked going to zoos. Nothing should be locked up in a cage. I feel guilty even keeping my roomates cat in the house all day. I know all he wants to do is go outside and play in the grass. 
Why. Ugh, poor thing.
The Japanese dont have a rich history of actually caring about animal life.
I'm by no means any sort of crazy animal rights person, but damn.  This really gets me to read.  
South Korea has it's share of depressing zoos. Dalseong Park in Daegu is horrible. I highly suggest visiting if you're looking for a good cry. On one visit I witnessed people throwing trash into the monkey enclosure and a guy trying to spit on the depressed bear. The only interesting thing about the Zoo/park is it's a hangout for elderly Korean men looking for elderly Korean prostitutes....I'm not making this up. Here's a video a foreigner made of the zoo. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o1jQL3_kjU

Someone should call Bob Barker.
This is disturbing. Animals have feelings too and we underestimate that every day. I for one am against caging wild animals for our amusement.

It has taken me many years to realize how wrong it is.

Edit: It really is a form of slavery
I say we abolish zoos. Abolish animal testing while we're at it. We have enough research data from all of the animal testing we've done over the last 60 years. 
damn this is incredibly sad
I mean, the alternative is being ~~in the wild~~ dead, because of fucking poachers.

The only zoo/zoo-like places I don't find terribly depressing and that actually treat animals well are the San Diego zoo and wild animal park, now called the San Diego safari park. I was lucky and got to go for free to both with my zoology class last year, and my out of state teacher was impressed by most of the enclosures.

I personally do not like Zoo's. It does not seem right, because it is not right to capture human beings and hold them in captivity to look at. Oh welcome to Rome, by the way we have captured some Barbarians from the north, an interesting people lets have a look, do not get too close to the cage and do not feed them.

If they are doing research which and the end goal is to help improve the lives of the animal going forward, that is meaningful. But to keep a large animal like a polar bear in a studio apartment, like that sad ass bear in my home town, in Central Park, that's wrong. The last time I went there my eyes were stinging with tears, I don't know how people justify this. Its not natural.
Make no mistake about it. Humans are exceptionally good at mistreating other living creatures. The Japanese eat whales and dolphins. And while all this makes me sick, the reality is, none of it matters. The world is full of suffering and it will be until life ceases to exist here. So my advice? Do whatever you can to make yourself happy without increasing the suffering of others and move on. 
That makes me want to cry. :-(

That's the size of the Kruger Park in South Africa, guys please rather support giant conservation parks, you'll have a once in a lifetime experience, and all the wild animals are allowed to be WILD ANIMALS!
Lots of people have misconceptions about South Africa but I promise you 5 star stays, it's really fancy and with the exchange rate you're going to have an incredible experience at a REALLY good price.

I'm sorry if this sounds like advertising spam but I'd rather have people go to proper reserves than Zoos!!
I am very thankful that the Elephant enclosure looks like this at the nearest Zoo to me: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina_Zoo#/media/File:NCZooelephants.jpg
/r/rage 
This just kills me. Elephants have way too much intelligence to exist in this manner. Hopefully, this one gets out really soon
thats really fucking heart breaking.
Whatever left out of Egypt's tourism is now finished. Sharm was the light at the end of the tunnel for Egypt. Now that light is out. 
The Paris attacks were horrific enough. I think we all need to be reminded, however, that even more Russians died in this single plane crash than in Paris a few days ago. If there was ever a "casus belli" for Putin, this would be it.
&gt;Mr Putin vowed to "find and punish" those behind the attack over the Sinai peninsula. A branch of so-called Islamic State said it downed the plane. "We'll look for them everywhere, wherever they are hiding. We'll find them in any corner of the planet and punish them."

Cat and mouse game begins.
Attacking Russia? Looks like ISIS wants to play the establishing sovereignty game on hard mode. 
If it does emerge that Isis caused the crash we need to ask, first of all, how they came to this capability and secondly, why they have persistently withheld any real detail of how they did it.
All we need to do is rotate our Facebook pictures by 90 degrees. 
Waiting for CNN's font size 72 headline for this.
I followed this closely; partner is Russian, family are in Dahab. Quite clear early on (despite the reddit skepticism) that the most likely cause was a smuggled explosive. These chemical tests should have been finished a while ago. They sat on this. Now after Paris they are calculating it is better to reveal than conceal. I think the Russian public is being prepared for a military escalation.
This is the perfect time for Britain, Russia, USA, France etc to join forces and destroy ISIS. Hitler fucked up when he messed with the Russians and if we could fight alongside Stalin then I'm sure we can fight alongside Putin so that these fuckers don't see the light of day again.
The last time Russia had casualties in the multiple hundreds was the apartment bombings which led them into Chechnya. 
Russia now you have more reason to wipe those shits off the universe.
Say [night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v71eF8HdZb8) night ISIS.
If Russia go full throttle, the only one coming out of this whole mess will be Assad. He can just sit back and watch as Russia take care of ISIS and the rebels for him.
I really wish these wankers in here who only feel the need to complain about how Facebook won't do anything would just fuck off.

If you really worry about what Facebook will do you need to get your priorities sorted. 


How is this not bigger news? 
The timing of this has been a bit strange to me - you look at the RT home page for the last week or so there has been barely any mention of this, even though 224 people were killed. Paris on the other hand fills the entire page. What I don't understand is why the attack on the airliner seems to have been downplayed by the Russian government, when to me it appears to justify their actions in Syria. 

In any case if there is a thawing of respective positions between the US and Russia, it can't be a bad thing. Perhaps a strong UN peacekeeping mission to section the country into controlled safe zones would be a possibility that Russia will not veto now?
how did they manage to bring an explosive on board? I mean with the current security system i thought it was almost impossible to make it 
RIP to those lost.

I hope with all my heart we make the evil pieces of shit who did this suffer.
To Russian people, cozheleyu.
stop, my facebook profile pic can only handle so many flag overlays
I hope Russia takes brutal revenge.
Reddit: Secretly hoping Russia does the dirty work the US and the EU won't do.
A $50 million reward! - Wow. Bin Laden had a $25 million bounty. 
Last time it ended up with [leveled Grozny](http://assets.fightland.com/content-images/contentimage/53311/Grozny-Destruction.jpg), ISIS, are you sure?
Sooo, can I start publicly executing ISIS members now?
#PrayForRussia

Oh wait. For some reason Facebook will never do things like this, and nor will the western people.

EDIT: 90 points and controversial? Thats a record!

Anyways, I didnt mean to shit all over the West or something, its just that I dont think the response to a terror attack in Russia would be as ´loving´ as a French one. Still, Im not talking down any of the events, both are extremely horrible.
[deleted]
We feel your pain and wish to join you against this evil. Enough is enough. 
Where are the Russian flags on peoples profile pictures ?
Didn't they say that after the attack in Paris that Russia will be next "very soon"?
Egyptian have security system worth millions, but its the human factor which failed. Lazy security officers, bribery, broken cameras which didnt work for ages, they just didnt take it seriously and happened what it happened. 
Religion will unite the world.. against religion.
Or, Russians have terrible measures regarding maintenance and safety for the aircraft and are using ISIS as a scapegoat. 
I can't wait to see the famous buildings lit up in the colors of Russian flag.

Oh wait, that will never happen. Those 224 Russians aren't as important as 128 French.
Now things get interesting.
A terror act brought down a plane in Ukraine too.
I just want to say that my heart goes out to all those families affected by this tragedy. 
I wonder, after it turned out to be a terrorist attack, does French people feel any remorse for mocking the victims with cartoons ( https://i.imgur.com/OyP52Fv.jpg https://i.imgur.com/o97E4nm.jpg https://i.imgur.com/6mNWxkm.jpg ) or does this still remains a "laughing matter" for them?
Will setting my facebook profile pic to the Russian flag help?
Just appeared on my TV (Japan).

This is insane.
Russia is about to seriously fuck those dudes up
Why don't we see Russian flags flying around?
Solidarity time folks. Let's see them fb pics changed. Go go go!
&gt;129 people died in Paris

&gt;out pouring of support for France from reddit

&gt;224 died from Russia

&gt;reddit continues to attack Putin

I see for some of you idiots sympathy is politically motivated.
Things We Already Knew for $500 Alex
I swear Reddit dickrides the biggest story. Last week this site was saying it was a Egyptian cover-up. 
What the fuck? 228?

At some point we are going to have to accept that bad ideas and ideologies are part of the problem. One does not have to change the language of the Quran to commit atrocities and believe that they are supported by God.

Bad ideas create beliefs. Beliefs lead to action. Action leads to the incident in Paris and something like this.

Sure, it may not of been an Islamic extremist... what am I saying? Of course it was
Russia seems like one of those countries that you should probably not fuck with. Ever. 
in b4 nobody gives a shit cuz putin
Hopefully Russia takes this as an opportunity to do something good for the world this time.
If you could evacuate all your citizens on holiday in a Muslim country before you begin your airstrikes.





That would be great.
So the person responsible is still working somewhere on the Egyptian airport.

US vs Russia - Part III incoming 
Seriously just carpet bomb the place.  Come on Mr Putin are counting in you!   Get Some!
Drop a big egg on the middle east, fuck morals.
I can't even imagine how much you have to charge that thing.
but where is the #prayforrussia
This world is too fuck up :( I'm scared. :(
Those poor people. I can't imagine how horrible that must've been, especially survived the initial explosion and were injured and alive until they crashed.
Why aren't terrorists more clear on where they're from and why they're acting? Seems like it would work out better for everyone
If I was in Raqqa right now, I'd be packing my bags. 
Everything is a terror act these days, isn’t it.
I'm missing something. This happened 2 weeks ago. Why is this just now in the news? Did they just find it? 
And the rose goes to .... Isis!!
I care man, we are all just meat sacs at the end of the day.
Oh, well, if Russia says so, then maybe the rest of the world intelligence community Is on to something after all.
It's the end of the World as we know it.
I guess they want to start World War III
Go get 'em, Vlad.  We're all right behind you (and would be upfront, if our local governments had the courage to organise).
Edit:  I'm old, and 2 of my military friends are already 'terminal'.  Any website got some targets within a fun 50-mile night drive?
These ISIS guys obviously have a death with.  Picking fights with half the Middle East, the US, Russia, and basically the entire continent of Europe and especially of all nations France, *simultaneously*.  If there's any such thing as ISIS by this time next year, I'll be surprised.
ISIS apparently doesn't remember what happened the last time Russia and the US were on the same side. 
Been a very successful month for these cowards. Attack people traveling on a plane, attack people at a cafe, attack people at a concert...just skipping by the embassy of the nations they hate so much. Shit Benghazi was attacked by militants who were braver than ISIS, what a bunch of cowards. Right up there with our Sandy Hook coward. 
ISIS claims every terror attack as their own.

they want to appear larger than they are.
I believe the correct terminology is that it was an act committed as part of the ongoing war between ISIS and the rest of civilization.
Well fuck. Im getting on two planes today
So their plan is to piss off everyone and get wiped off the face of the earth. Seems like a good one. 
Russia should invade Afghanistan now.
Don't people know that you don't fuck with the Russians? 

Like ... Who the fuck would ever fuck with the Russians? 
What's scary is that this whole Daesh situation may just be a coy to bring the soldiers to the battlefield to start a fight
If it were a terror act, wouldn't a group have come forward by now and claim responsibility?

I'm not saying it wasn't, but don't they normally jump on the opportunity to say they did it? 
Can someone ELI5 if Putin is as "Russian gung-ho" as everyone likes to say he is?

Not just Putin, but Russia in general? Are these aged archetypes? Or actual behavior we can expect after happenings like this?
The world is suck a fucked up place... May they rest in peace
DAMN Putin is a gangster. 
"Terrorists behind the downing of the Russian tourist jet should be strapped to bombs and dropped on ISIS targets, a top lieutenant of Vladimir Putin says."

I would pay to see that 


Didn't this happen almost a month ago? Why now is it being blasted all over media?
&gt; President Sisi

&gt;Sisi

&gt;Isis

&gt;mindblown.gif
Wouldn't it be amazing if NATO and Russia work together to take down ISIS? Already, it's bringing Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia on to the same side, even if they don't like to openly admit it.

Who would have thought? Maybe ISIS is the ultimate evil that can eventually lead the rest of us towards conciliation. 
Yeah. How about that plane that "went down" in Ukraine. 
The Russians have never been known for their subtlety when dealing with matters like this. They tend to be a lot less concerned with "collateral damage", too. Getting the Russians pissed off at you is seldom a wise move.
"We are going to pursue terrorists everywhere. If they are in the airport, we will pursue them in the airport. And if we capture them in the toilet, then we will waste them in the outhouse. … The issue has been resolved once and for all,” he told Russian media."

Putin talking about the Moscow apartment bombings ~15 years ago. Granted, those bombings may have been arranged by the FSB, but details details.

Good quote. 
my thoughts and prayers go out to the people of russia
Are people from Paris France considered more valuable humans? Why is there such an imbalanced response for these things?
Smart to wait until after the attacks affected France to rush to the conclusion that they were indeed the target of a terrorist attack. 

Saves face for their domestic audience. Makes it appear to not only be just because they were involved in the Syria, it also draws the sympathy for the Russian people, And helps spin its involvement in Syria to a positive more seemingly altruistic light to its international audience. 
https://youtu.be/wQJshxuF9zA

I added it to my video log!
I forgot which article I read it from but right after the paris attack, ISIS claimed to hit a few other places with Russia being next. And looks like they followed through. Anyone else not read that? Surprised Russia Airlines didn't take maximum precautions. 

Edit: just found out the plane crash was in Oct. 30, so maybe they don't go in chronological order
I'm still trying to figure out how pissing off France, Russia and the US and becoming their common enemy is considered a good idea.
Just as I said for Lebanon, Kenya, and Paris my heart and prayers goes out Russia and those families aboard the plane.

We can't just sit by and allow the Middle East to stay in Chaos. The World needs to work together as a whole and bring peace to the region. 
Scary stuff.
Anyone remember what happened to the last guy who attacked Russia and France at the same time?   I seem to remember things not working out for him. 
I'm growing to hate Islam more and more 
Not like those totally fine acts where Russian funded "Ukrainians" shot down that passenger plane
&gt;Daesh enters the game on nightmare mode

  &gt;Declares war on: Russia, America, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, England, Poland, Belgium.

  &gt;Ends turn.
does it say by whom the terror act was orchestrated?
Can't wait for Putin to further intensify the attacks with FULL THROTTLE
Какой сюрприз, Русские должны показать всему миру как справиться с террористами
Funny how he dint care about the plane in Ukraine. Some should have a really bad taste in their mouth. I have... 
We knew that a while ago... 

Could you please now blame ISIS? and help us in our war against them?

- a Frenchman :P
Time to update my Facebook picture.
Funny how I did not see people with russian flags in theis facebook photos, or #prayforrussia rashtags. The world is too much selective deciding the "worst" disaster...
Nobody's changing their Facebook profile pics to the Russian flag because nobody likes Russia. Pretty obvious, why all the moaning?
Isis is bout to be is not is not
What's with the attitude of this headline? "Russia's security chief says ..." Do we not give any credit to Russian reports?
SO we take his word for it but still give him the benefit of the doubt that the commercial airliner shot down by his missles wasn't his fault?
Can your disgusting medias drop your double standard quotation marks?
What's up with the BBC's title and write-up on this? Seems a bit insensitive.
hate to be party runiner , but I belive more people were killed in palestine , Iraq , afghanistan , and much more .


so instead of #prayforparis

#prayfortheworld
Ukraine, Putin?
Are we supposed to be surprised by this?
Will this mean that Russia with join forces with the US and Nato to target positions?  
Hell of a turnaround time on that investigation when Russia isn't the one shooting passenger jets out of the sky. 
"Welcome to the party pal!"
Remember, No Russians
But, to suspend flights to protect their citizens while the investigation was going on, forget about it...Russians are lucky a couple other planes didn't blow up in the meantime while they were criticizing the West's response. 
Let's see how many Russian flags we see on Facebook...
Does that mean my Facebook picture is now going to be a Russian flag?
What brought down the plane in Ukraine? 
Seems pretty convenient for this info to surface in the wake of a terrorist incident. Perhaps it was an assassination that fits the terrorist narrative?
In Tomorrow's News: ISIS obliterated with the power of Atom.
something something 8th crusade is about to start
Repeat of the "Russian apartment bombings" incident in 1999. A tragedy is conveniently used to justify intervention. Suspicious? 
I am always interested in how titles are phrased. For example the use of quotations for "terror act". Even though intentions might have been otherwise, it makes the reader (to a degree) have some sort of suspicion that this might not have been a terror act at all. (Given Russia's bad history of regard for its people, etc)
The scale of brainwashing over there is insane! You've got a whole so called *state* of people thinking this is the right thing to do. 
[Unfortunate people died, but this gonna be good.  Russia won't apologize.](http://i.imgur.com/S6HAKVZ.gif)
So...The same thing the rest of the world said two weeks ago?
Karma, Rusia forget about the innocent people they killed in that certain passenger airliner over Ukraine? 
I remember how the Russians laughed and mocked when the UK and USA suggested that it might be terrorism.

The timing of this information coming to light seems oddly convinient given what happened in Paris last Friday.
It's. about to go. DOWN.
Didn't Putin just announce that he has proof that 40 countries have helped ISIS in some way?

Throw that in the mix and things look like they could get ugly
False flag to garner support for propping up Assad?
What about the one in Ukraine? 
How do you know putin didn't just blow up his own plane?
MH17. Eat a dick Putin.

I hope they release the evidence for this. I read that the plane was malfunctioning before takeoff.
Why does the article make me distrust the russians so much? Even from the headline "terror act" they want you do disbelieve the russian statements.
What if Russia destroyed the ane themselves as a push for attacking
So ISIS have murdered nearly 370 innocent people this month, not including the probably many innocent people murdered in Syria and Iraq by them. 

This is very right wing of me, but they need to be obliterated 
[Russian terrorist join  the fight against terrorism.](http://i.imgur.com/enOfhGT.jpg)
And very few people changed their avatars with France's flag and said "Pray for Russia". Here on Reddit too. Not a single day passed that Reddit put the flag of Russia on top.
Not only the lives of the people in Arab countries considers cheap, but also whoever doesn't apply to the Western norms of setting the agenda.
It's sickening. 
Today we heard 32 Nigerians lost their lives in bomb attack. Why no body cares?
ww3? 
If ISIS was responsible for this terrorist attack, why haven't they come forward about their "success"? I was under the impression that's how they work. Granted, it was actually ISIS in the first place...


Glad they figured out what the rest of the world already knew. 
lol nice try Russia...lol
As shitty as it is to say in the wake of death, I feel like Putin set this one up.... 

This is coming from someone who doesn't believe much of the inside job bullshit people say about this country. Lol 
Interesting how only after the events in paris, Russia comes out and declares this a terrorist attack. Suddenly it's become unifying and not a sign of weakness. 

edit:i meant paris.

Isn't it time for countries to start using bio weapons? Imagine an ebola outbreak in the ISIS. It would be catastrophic for them. I understand that a lot of collateral damage will occur, but they were going to die at the hands of terrorists anyway. 

I dont know about you guys but I would betray the fuck out of my squad for 50 million dollars. 
To put that in perspective the reward for info that led to the capture of Bin Laden was $25 million.
I am just imagining the gnarly Russian assassins this is going incentivize to go after the bombers. 
ISIS will turn them in for the money.
I need to reconsider my career choices. 
Bandar bin Sultan is the powerful member of house of Saud, the royal family which runs Saudi Arabia, overseeing and funding terrorist activities all over the world including Chechnya and Syria.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandar_bin_Sultan

Where do I collect the money?
It's probably not even government money he's offering. Just some cash he forgot he had in his attic. 
[Just make sure they end up with the right guy](http://media.moddb.com/images/groups/1/3/2933/rabbit.jpg)
Fifty Million Dollars???

Who they think they got, Chelsea Clinton?
Did Russia specifically put this in dollars when he announced it? That seems odd considering how they dont really get along with us. But also the idea of announcing it as 3.3 trillion rubles sounds odd. Does anyone know how this was originally released to the press?
Brb, training to be a mercenary. 
Something about Putin and Russia's tenacity is... both inspiring and scary.

Even with all the bad publicity he and the country gets, he seems to genuinely care. Even if it's in a weird, controlling dad kind of way.

EDIT: Punctuation is lost on me today.
Almost makes you wonder if it is worth it for ISIS to turn in their own people for the reward money.
Don't be surprised when Daesh cuts their heads off themselves to collect the funds.
I'm going to find those shits. I could really use that money
I'm picturing a dirty, bald, long-bearded brute clad in furs with a leather body harness and a rifle over his shoulder stomping into the Kremlin's lobby, swinging a couple of heads by their hair and tossing them lightly so they roll up to the receptionist's feet and speaks with a thick accent-

"fiftah million... I am here to collect that which was promised."
That seems like a small print deception amount.  *must bring in all suspects in handcuffs to this address between 8am and 9am..
US offers $5 million for IS leader. Russia responds by saying $50 million just for the airline bombers.

Kinda feels like the overall response to this crisis in a way. US supplies menial munitions to 'rebels', while Russia bombs the living hell out of ISIS.
Russia: $50 million for Egypt plane bomber

U.S: $5 million for leader of ISIS

*Obama, are you even trying?*

Me: "I'm here to collect my reward Mr. Putin"

(places head of Bandar on table)

Putin: "What reward... Nikola...please show this gentlemen out...the window"
So have we already forgotten that Russian backed rebels shot down a plane full of European civilians last year?
You ever watch The Hurt Locker? You know that one scene with the (Australian?) Bounty hunters? I think that would be an interesting job to have. Hunt terrorists for money? Fuck yeah.
The Lannisters send their regards.
It's a ton of money but would anyone trust Putin to pay out?
Chapo offered $100 millions for trump. 
Putin is literally Darth Vader. I love it. 

SOMEONE CALL BOBBA FETT!
It was probably a guy named Muhammed. I'll take that in cash please.
50 Million Dollars? Who did they blow up, Chelsea Clinton?
Yeah, I wouldn't count on it. He's probably talking more like 3 billion RUB.
I wonder if Putin would be willing to bring it down to 49.9m and use the other bit to pay off my loans.
Say what you want but I miss the KGB. They got shit done. 
Cotton Candy Lover Chopper only has a 50 berry bounty. 
Am I the only one that pictured Putin making it rain on a table full of heads at a press conference after reading that title?
I know where they are. They're in the last place you look!



^can^I^get^my^money^now? 
Whats your country's version of "this many football fields long"?
So someone within ISIS will turn them in and then have 50 million more dollars to spend on terrorism 
This wasn't a suicide bombing? So someone snuck a bomb in with a timer beforehand? Just haven't heard all of the details yet!
I bet there are a lot of terrorists out there who like $50 million a lot more than they like their terrorist buddies.
PUTIN MAD, TAKE THIS GRENADE AND PUT-IN ISIS ASS
I think their own mothers will turn them in for that much.  

Vader styled badassery 
Didn't Putin try to poison Ukrainian President Victor Yushchenko a few years ago?



The only man that can pull such job is John Wick.
Next week's headline: Putin catches metrojet bomber heads all by himself. Graciously accepts reward.
Putin knows how the world works..
And he means, JUST the heads.
Time to quit my job, put in my Boba Fett costume, and go to work.
Every time a press release or news article comes out about Putin, I like him more. Dude is such a friggin' bro. 
Putin is like Obama but with balls 
That's how you get shit done.
I feel like in a way, Putin is the communist version of Ronald Regan. Regarding his aggressive nature at least. 
Hey Blondie - you,  and angel eyes should  partner up with  me , your good friend tucco. We can go get that bounty.
Dog the bounty hunter and his boy Leland are on it 
Atta boy Vlad! I wish I could deliver them myself. 50 mil would be pretty sweet!
*Looking for the grave of Mohammed*
Is it weird for me to think better of Putin now that he's declared war on ISIS? 
Do they not get that these are the same folks that do suicide bombings? 

*  Setup: Get funding.
*  Step 1:  Get suicide bomber.
*  Step 2:  Have that person target a plane.
*  Step 3:  Turn in the person that blew up the plane.
*  Step 4:  That person is killed (like they are willing to do anyways)
*  Step 5:  Get 50mm in funding.
*  Step 6:  Goto step 1. 
Putin is a very shifty character. It seems like this reward is bogus, it's a way for them to pretend that they DON'T know who bombed the plane, so they can delay making a decision about whether they should escalate their actions against Isis.  I almost never take anything the Russians say at face value, they expect everyone not to trust them so they feel comfortable making bold faced lies to the public. They know who did it -- Isis -- they just don't want to deal with that reality right now.
Seriously, Daesh could just "martyr" one of their own to claim their reward. Then Russia would be directly funding terror.
So Russia and France are now gloves off. The USA has yet to fully commit but thinking about it. 
Putin; Making Obama look like a pussy since 2008.
I hope Russia gets involved.  For some reason we (the West) root for them when their Special Forces retaliate by kidnapping and killing the entire immediate families of these scumbags.  I mean don't get me wrong, I love the bloodbath of tearing apart the entire bloodline of a terrorist, I just wish the US didn't get chastised for doing so.
Putin and Russia will never pay it. Watch whoever gets it disappear on holiday in Belarus. 
While I'm sure to be down-voted. Id just like to say from Gloucester UK.. Go Putin!
[Memories sure are short.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17)
So, who is creating the task force? :P
It's not about the money it's about sending a message to those motherfuckers. 
These bombers are toast.  There isn't a safe haven in the middle east where someone won't turn on them for that money.
Anyone wanna form a squad and collect the money?
Putin is kind of like a Bond villain. 
Watch that Putin, he'll steal that as well.
Fuck that's a lot of money.  Why not "only" $10M instead?  You wouldn't get any credible clues for that much money?

Hell, for $50M I will admit right now that I did it.  I'm positive that my wife and kids will appreciate the $50M a lot more than they'll miss me ;)
Has any terror organization came out and claimed they did this? Don't they usually release a statement saying they are responsible? 
Hurry, someone call Dog the Bounty Hunter!
A part of me instantly thought... what does Putin want with some football players
Who wants to bet that money ends up funding terrorism no matter what?
Anyone want to start a bounty hunting business?
Calling /r/weekendgunnit. Time to put those dank room clearing skills and triple quad rail to use!
We are talking about a group that uses suicide bombers to kill 10 people... 

Why would they not turn in some random guy in the group take the 50mil and use that to kill even more people...
Wow, thats a headline you dont hear often. I didnt think governments put out bounties anymore.
Well now I know how I'm spending my day.
Can he afford that? More importantly, how does one *collect* the bounty?
Bet it's not going to take as long as it took for the US take out bin Laden. 
If i were a lower-level ISIS militant from the area, i'd be getting a little nervous if i had done anything recently to piss-off the higher-ups...
I knew I should have followed my dream of international bounty hunting.
It was some pissed off Muslim dudes. Make the check out to cash.
Give me $25 Million down and I'll have those heads outsourced to the Philippines to be shrunk for pesos on the dollar within the year. 
Once they discover the identity of the bombers or someone gets rated out I am pretty sure that entire persons family is going to be wiped from existence. 
But how the one who kill them will survive to get $50m. Just Asking. 
can Russia afford $50 Million? 
Dear mr Poutine, 

My upstairs neighbor did it. Now I know why he was blasting his music at all times of night. To encrypt his voice.

It only makes sense.

Signed,

One soon to be rich bastard.

Fall for Putin's game redditors
Say what you will about Putin and Russian. But i think that if ISIS isnt careful, they will meet and anger someone who will and can step up to their level of cruelty and go beyond it.

If these gets or anyone else get caught by Russia alive. You can be pretty sure it will involve torturing them
I like the idea behind offering money. Because its gonna seed fear and distrust between them. We often hear about people who wanna get out from ISIS. 50 million large ones sounds like a pretty good deal to me. 
I don't think he is good for it
it's obviously a political move that says: we know who's behind and it's not a bunch of little goat keepers with a can of gunpower but a powerful nationstate
So some weasel who mixes in the same circles, and possibly complicit in the metrojet bombing, will become a multimillionaire. No like.
*gets rucksack, calls friends, buys plane ticket*
How does a bounty of this size work? Can it be given to one person? Is it meant to go to a country if their govt/military captures them?
No disintegrations.
Wait, he didn't declare war on a country?
All well and good, but it wasn't the anti-al-Assad rebels that brought down the plane.  It would be great if Russia could clarify who their targeting on a daily basis.
Keep your money, it was the US to get Putin to take care of the mess. 
What if America's Navy Seals kill them? 


ELI5: do bounties like this really get paid?
Putin his money where his mouth is.
:o i'll get my hat..
Breaking News:  Putin single handedly captures Metrojet Bombers.  Collects $50 Million Bounty
But who will turn them in? ISIS members? $50m is worthless to them unless they can get cleared of all their charges and get a visa to some western nation, which is pretty much impossible.

I suppose his target audience is really mercenaries.
Man, we only ever put $25 mil on Bin Laden.
Deash went and stuck their dick in crazy...
I'll do it. Point me in the right direction and I will kill them.
ELI5: How is Saudi Arabia still an ally of the US when it's globally known that they fund terrorists. Why haven't countries called the US out on this?

Is everyone literally turning a blind eye for oil? Even with all the terrorist shit going on?
Its funny how people think they can just throw money out at a problem and fix it. The jihadist are trained from a very young age to hate infidels. It's all they know. They wouldn't have a clue what to do with the money, other than buy weapons to slaughter infidels. Some people just want to watch the world burn. 
He really is some next level James Bond Villisca stuff.

The kind that you secretly route for as long as his gun isn't pointed at James Bond. 
Can Russia even afford to give away 50 million.
Bin Laden's bounty was $25m. Pretty sure Putin can spend that money in a better way.
Didnt russia shoot down a civilian plane in eastern europe earlier this year?
facebook wont let me post this...anybody else?
So the assumption is the bombers weren't on the plane? Then how the fuck did they get the bomb onto the plane....Unless it was an inside job...
Nice!  Looks like there's a new sheriff in town.  Move over USA &lt;hip check&gt;

"You blew up an airplane filled with citizens of my country?  I destroy your oil stockpile, refineries, leaders, armed brainwashed fighters, and anyone who funded you."

Woo!  Take out the Sauds next!  Go Putin!
This proves my theory that nothing good has ever been inside a Schweppe's can. 
Does anyone actually think they would get the money?
What's to stop ISIS from turning in some patsy and using that 50 million for more attacks?
How hard is it for this group to, point someone else out, get the 50 mil and still support their group?
Putin is brilliant; 

Announce bounty, have ISIS jagoff behead own comrade, have him bring head, behead him on arrival. Dump corpse near ISIS lands, announce bounty for the beheader of the guy who beheaded the bombers.

ISIS can't fuckin' read so they're obviously dumb enough to fall for it.
What a bad ass 
For this kind of money I'd rat my own mother out. 
So if the US Feds catch the bombers, will Putin still pay up?
You could buy an island for that amount of money. I hope the pieces of shit are caught.
With that kind of money the terrorists who turn them in can recruit even more people!  
Fuck he's a scary guy. Both personally and powerfully.
I think the guy who bombed that plane died in the explosion. 
Maybe the world can chip in and offer a $50mil bounty for those who blew up MH17.
It's probably not even government money he's offering. Just some cash he forgot he had in his attic. 
I could see the bombers rationalize it as furthering the jihad by sacrificing themselves to get the $50M bounty. 

They find an unknown member of Daesh, cook up a story how he caught them, he collects the bounty and hands the profit over to Daesh.

Can someone tell me if Putin can "scam" and refuse to pay the people if they turn in the Heads of Metrojet bombers?

Similarly, is there enough incentive for these people to believe what Putin said?
Yes, and then instead of giving the reward to the one who betrays his jihadbros, he will murder the guy in the most horrible way imaginable.
This sounds like a plot for The Blacklist.
where's dog the bounty hunter when you need him?
Putin hasn't been playing lately, has he? He's out for blood. 
Sounds like Putin just fatwa'd some terrorist ass.
This is serious money.  The assholes responsible for this latest atrocity have got to be coming to the realization that this represents a jet setter lifestyle for anyone who sells them out.  Hell, it might even solve a funding problem or two for higher ups in ISIL.  
Oopsie!
No one is getting their money regardless of the outcome.  Whoever catches the bomber won't want to publicly announce that they were the ones that captured this terrorist for fear of reprisal from ISIS.  Putin has zero motive to pay you since crying about how Putin fucked you exposes you potential attack.  This is not limited to other terrorist turning him in, but smaller countries also.  
Who is this Putin guy? I think I like him.
3 kinds of people in this world
So is it 50 million of his own money or the taxpayers of Russia's money?
Theyd have to torture him for years to make it worth their 50million
This is the only thing I can think of whenever I hear about Russian retribution against Daesh. http://youtu.be/VuofaDxa6Oo

This news came out yesterday and I'm only just hearing about it on Reddit. I'm one of those terrible non-contributory users, but even I'm frightened about what's happening  to this place. 
Pro tip: you aren't getting paid from Putin but you will be killed
i picture his bounty hunters to be like the people darth vader hired 
Compare this to the puny 5 million bounty Obama put on someone yesterday.
(serious) do bounties actually pay????
i know USA has put bounties on people but i've never heard of anyone claiming them.If a group of ex-military found the metrojet bombers and captured them and asked for the $50million would they receive it and live long unless to spend it???
$50 mil will buy a LOT of soda can bombs...

Seems like a good move for ISIS to hand em over. 

"These guys. Yup JUST these guys. Assholes, amirite?"
Wait until they turn them in then, oh wait what's this it's a double-cross you turrurist asshole!  
Dave Chappelle's like o shit, here's my second chance.
They ain't got 50 mil
Oooh, someone's cyka'd putin's blyats.
I wonder how quickly this will bring them in, I would have thought that with that kind of incentive, a good few bounty hunters will be on the trail. 
Daesh get a couple of fall guys give them up cool $50 million clams ! thank you very much mr putin for the much needed cash injection !
Any Metrojet bombers want to use my place as a hideout? I promise I won't kill you, cut off your head, and take it to the Russian embassy for that sweet $50 million.
In rubles?  so like 700k USD
Someone should put a $500 million bounty on Putin's head. 
But what if the bombers were on the metrojet?
I don't like the idea of second in command of boko haram getting 50Million dollars.
When this campaign began Putin said something very interesting "we might decide to employ our better weaponry there"
They blew themselves up, you serious Putin? 
Wow, Putin is so badass, on his chair, using stolen quotes from movies, putting bounties on people's heads. I'd like him to see fight on the battlefield once, and I'm not talking these staged photos of him riding bears and what not.

Anyways, Putin is a coward. For some odd reason, reddit seems to glorify villains when facing other villains. Oh, ISIS threatened Russia?

"HAHAHAHAHAHA ISIS YOU DONE FUCKED UP NOW, HAHA ATTACK THEM DURING WINTER THEYRE THE MOST VULNERABLE."

Oh, ISIS threatened China?

"OH YEAH GOOD PLAN ISIS HAHAHAHA GO AHEAD AND ATTACK CHINA AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS ROFLMAO."

Seriously, fuck off.
tax payer bounty, lovely
Don't fuck with the Russian.
This story actually happened and don't ask me how I know.

Some Russian Diplomats were kidnapped in an African country.
The kidnappers, some gang with connections to local 'Rebels', demanded a quite high randsome. However, the Russians (in cooperation with the local authorities) silenced all communications of the hostage takers so no one outside the groups directly involved knew about this crisis.

At some point the Russians found out the identities of the hostage takers. Special forces tracked down family members of them, kidnapped them and killed a few, made photo's and send them to the hostage takers demanding immediately letting them free or the same would happen to their other family members.

Russian Diplomats were let go, the hostage takers were tracked down anyways and killed, but in Africa they already know to not fuck with Russia.
Why don't we have a bounty on the crew of the BUK missile launcher that shot down MH17? Payment in roubles of course.
What's the bounty for the guys who shot down MH-17?
A bounty probably isn't a meaningful measure to take.  It will lead to manufactured evidence.  It's kind of a mess, because a) people will hide evidence to retain "ownership", and b) 100 people will call with the same evidence they heard from each other and each claim entitlement to the info bounty.

We put out a $25M bounty on Bin Laden.  Nothing came of it.  No one turned him in.  In the end the US military took down Bin Laden but they're not entitled to any bounty.  We never paid out a dime of it so it might as well have been $100 billion.

http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2013/11/man_seeking_25_million_bounty.html

Guy claims he sourced the info for that raid.  He may be partially right, or completely wrong.  I'm guessing investigations/intel don't readily acknowledge the value or uselessness of info.  That is, if you write a letter detailing why he's in a particular place, they couldn't tip their hand by saying "yes we already know and this is redundant" or "no, because we're pretty sure the case for another location is stronger". 

There's no legal framework for a transaction involving intelligence.  You can't own anything once you share the tip.  The value is never provable and the payor will simply deny it was key.  

And, realistically, *most* of the tips will be useless.  In fact the wise man would write a different tip for every single one of 100 theoretical scenarios and claim ownership of all possibilities.  One will be true in itself, but it was not actually a usable tip.

Same sort of spam would happen even if multiple unconnected people respond.  10,000 "tips" claiming he's hiding in a neighbor's attic, each one being a DIFFERENT attic.  Yeah, whatever.  Maybe in the end the investigation triangulates a cellphone call and identifies a suspect house and does an IR camera surveillance and find the attic area is being heated as if occupied and finds him that way.  The one "a broken clock is still right twice a day" tip for that attic was 100% accurate, yet irrelevant.

In many ways it's similar to needing to own novel "ideas" via the patent system- but there's no way that framework could work for tips.  You couldn't readily acknowledge the existence of all the existing intel "ideas" to prove or disprove novelty.  And it's prone to spamming, and simply being correct does not actually prove it was useful at all, much less "key".   A subtle difference is a tip probably *can't* be a novel creation.  I mean if you made it up as a creative work, it's not a real tip.  You heard from your cousin that he's known to be part of this one group that meets at a certain place... well yeah maybe that's a valuable thing but ownership of the idea isn't necessarily yours.

In case you don't know, he is one of the most important journalists in Turkey(you can see this by checking Twitter's Worldwide trending list right now) and the head of one of the oldest Turkish newspaper.
Imprisoning reporters tends to give public opinon that they were on to something. Freedom of press is an important right for society. The press keeps the government and corporations honest. Because the press finds the skeletons in their closet.
When you cut out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you are only telling the world you fear what he has to say. 
For non-Turkish people: Can Dündar is one of the most famous journalists in Turkey. Maybe top 3. He is a secular guy.^please^help^us

FYI, American journalist Serena Shim was killed soon after reporting Turkey was using aid trucks to smuggle weapons etc for ISIS last year.

"What does it matter if these trucks were carrying weapons or not?"

Yeah...because there's no difference between a peaceful aid convoy and a military resupply mission.

Erdogan is a fuckhead who supports terrorism.
Turkey currently has more journalists in prison than any other country yet somehow it's allowed to be a member of NATO.
Nothing like having a nonsecular government and country leader that supports ISIS, being in NATO. 
It's ridiculous that these closed backwards societies don't allow simple press freedom.

Like we do with Manning and Snowden.

&gt; For the coverage of the MİT trucks, President Erdoğan has publicly targeted Dündar, saying: "The individual who has reported this as an exclusive story will pay a heavy price for this," in a television interview with state broadcaster TRT late in June.

&gt;"We are being charged with being spies, the president is saying that we are traitors to the state. We are not spies, we are not traitors, we are not heroes; we are journalists," Dündar added outside the courthouse.

&gt;After the publication of video stills as well as video footage, Erdoğan lashed out at Cumhuriyet and Dündar for publishing the evidence and publicly vowed that Dündar would "Pay a heavy price" for his report.
Interesting friends you have America.  Turkey... Saudi Arabia... Egypt... Israel... Not exactly beacons of human rights but American allies none the less. 
Because erdogan doesn't want people to know how much he is supporting ISIS. He secretly wants to be Caliph.

Can any Turk shed some light on when exactly did everything go downhill?
Edrogan is a back stabbing despot, first he kills Kurds by the thousands, then he funds ISIS and then he attempts to initiate WWIII. 
Turkey was so close to drag the NATO to a war against Russia, stupid scum, meanwhile Europe has done virtually nothing relevant to stop supplies, weapons and oil from crossing the syrian border. It is clear everyone has geopolitical interests on Syria.
and the west is supporting turkey, good job guys.

Erdogan has one goal which is to become President for Life. Turkey has two Aces to stay in NATO. One is it could block passage to and from the Black Sea and the Russian Navy.

Is there any way for opposition parties to unite and force early elections? I understand Erdogan won a few months ago, but did not have the necessary mps to change the constitution. Do all his mps toe the party line? Are there any potential defectors?

It's clear turkey is supporting ISIS.  They are right next door, why hasn't ISis attacked them?  Terror state.
We knew about turkey smuggling ISIS thru it's borders but this one just breaks the Camels back. Russia should bomb Turkey. Like a double tap on the forehead for them to wake up
And they're NATO allies because...?
Starting to sound like we need to take a much closer look at Turkey's "NATO Membership" status.

turkey has earned it's it's reputation historically, and every nation surrounding turkey despises them for a reason. The recent hate is because more people are becoming aware of the actual history of the turks, and the turkish propaganda and attempt to rewrite history in it's favor has hit a brick wall. The atrocities committed almost in every single generation of turks is appalling and horrendous, and their true colors are coming to light in the world view due to recent events. The only reason turkey tries to play nice in recent years is because it wanted in with EU, but that will never happen.

Turkey won't even admit to the Armenian Genocide.. They have been, and always will be animals. 
The allies we and Obama is supporting everyone.
It's the institute! Run!
I believe they are picking the wrong side.  Id hate to think what the loved ones of Turkey's decision makers are facing.  I smell extortion. 
Here is the huge twist, i'm not making anything up, it's a known fact in Turkey. I don't support arrests and i hate Erdoğan.

Few years ago, many people including journalists, soldiers got arrested in Turkey. Other than AKP supporters, everybody said they were arrested because they opposed to AKP. That was partly true because most of them were not that good with AKP. People who defending them blamed an organization called Hizmet. Hizmet is a religious organization and we knew they were always powerful in police and law structures. They were pretty good with AKP. While people getting arrested, they were blaming Hizmet and they were saying judges were listening Hizmet and creating fake evidences against them. Can Dündar and newspaper he's working was supporting them all the time and blaming Hizmet.

Fast forward few years, AKP and Hizmet had a huge fight. Reasons unknown but they became enemies. First attack came from Hizmet. We realized they were listening many members of AKP (even Erdoğan himself) and recording the calls. They released many tapes about corruption in AKP, again even recordings of Erdoğan. After that Erdoğan and AKP basically declared war on Hizmet. They shut down their business, TV stations, newspapers, arrested many of the supporters, changed judges and polices. They are still fighting and we still see some reports which we don't know its source.

Fast forward few years again, Hizmet supporters stopped a truck carrying weapons to Syria and released the info. Few years after the incident, Can Dündar somehow got the videos of that operation. Ofcourse only people joined that operation had the recordings and they were Hizmet supporters. They gave it to Can Dündar so he can publish the story, hurt Erdoğan and damage image of Turkey in international arena. Cumhuriyet, newspaper who published the story even tweeted English about the report before the publication.

So, Erdoğan is pissed because Can Dündar were working with his biggest enemy. Can Dündar done something weird because he was against Hizmet few years earlier.
its a mistake of turkish intelligence they couldn't keep a secret they should keep and now a journalist is getting arrested. but its not an unusual event in turkey... unfortunately!
Arresting journalists is exactly the kind of thing you *do not* want to do if you want people to accept your side of the story. But hey, Erdogan seems to be having some slow days lately, especially after openly admitting that he himself ordered the Russian plane to be shot.
So is all of this going on inside of my stomach right now?
Now that we have destroyed our turkey, it is time to destroy Turkey.
*Weapon-loaded 

Makes the title easier to read
tl;dr The journalists revealed state secrets. While lying about what they filmed. Which you can see for yourself.

Okay, got it.
As long as members due their part in this hellhole. i am sorry for you or anyone else in Turkey.
Any yahoo with an iPhone can be a serious problem, but because it's the United States Syria?

Erdogan has weaseled his way to become President.
&gt;Footage released by Cumhuriyet on May 29 reportedly showed gendarmerie and police officers opening crates on the back of trucks which contained what the daily described as weapons and ammunition sent to Syria by MİT in January 2014.

So Massachusetts is supplying terrorists with weapons?
Because the press is an invaluable asset.
CIA
Nice snack country.

Just add them to the list... /s

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arrested_journalists_in_Turkey


If donation is an invaluable asset.
Turkey is a piece of shit terrorist country. Why the fuck are they still part of NATO? Russia better Roast those fuckers. 
If Turkey is in NATO why are they helping Syria. And who are they helping?
Turkey's asking for war.
And evul Russians dare to bomb that humanitarian trucks :(
I'm sure we might care about this in America one the leftists are done polishing the Turkish knob. 
The Syrian regime, despite being an authoritarian asshole, who is quite uneducated and only cares about religion.
Didn't the exact same thing happen when Russia was sending "aid" trucks to Ukrainian rebels. 
afghanistan:pakistan == syria:turkey ?
I might have to play devils advocate for a second because the story won't load so I don't know the details. Just based off ops title, is it possible that they were arrested because military movements are often very guarded? Lose lips sink ships type stuff? Everybody knows that the west has been supplying assorted rebel groups, so that's not news at all. Writing a story saying who, what, when, where, and why is probably going to get somebody killed, maybe Turkey doesn't have the press protections other NATO countries have and that was enough. 
I mean, weren't we all arming Syrian rebels? 
Out of curiosity. Is there a procedure in place for kicking a country out of NATO? Has such a thing ever happened before?
The west is supporting ISIS.
Fkn Turkish gov is helping the damned terrorists and NATO still covering their ass...
Its so obvious  Turkey sponsors  and protects  terrorist  organization. The aim of Turkey is to prevent  a kurdish  state  in northern Syria  by supplying  drugs and weapons to ISIS. Looking  back, they have history  of savagery agains non Muslims  /Armenians.
As a NATO member it should be sanctions internationally. 
And watch America ignore it.

TL:DR Turkey, once again, can eat a bag of dicks.
So this is our ally in ww3?
Denying the Armenian genocide, shooting a fucking missile at a Russian jet that "violated" airspace for 10 seconds, and now this. 
Fuck you Ergodan.
I read this title three times asking myself, "Wait, WHAT IS THIS TITLE TRYING TO SAY ABOUT THANKSGIVING?!?!"
Well the stage is set... who will be the Franz Ferdinand of WW3?
Can we just remove them from NATO? Is that even a thing?
THERE IT IS!!! &lt;3  
 I was waiting for this I was freaking waiting for this.  
They take their cheep oil, in exchange for arms, and claim to be fighting them. It is the beauty of the shitstorm military industrial complex utopia now created. 
Putin invented those trucks
What kind of garbage title is this?  
[deleted]
Can we kick Turkey out of NATO yet?
I know that Turkey does this all the time for political reasons, but this is probably the one time where they are right to arrest journalists. They are at war; handing military secrets to the enemy is treason.

Edit: so the title is bs clickbait. The incident happened more than a year ago and in all likelyhood they published it after the fact, not during. If it was actually helping the enemy, they would have been arrested on the spot in any civilized country. So this too is probably politically motivated. The actual purpose of the trucks back then (as opposed to if it had happened now) is a whole other can of worms, which I won't open.
Turkey seem to have [a thing for journalists](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-29499683).
Arguing on the internet is pointless, do the work and look it up yourself.
Damn it Turkey you should disappear them not arrest them. Jesus get your shit together
Turkey should be kicked out of EU.
/r/titlegore
In case anyone didn't know, US, France, Russia, Israel, Turkey, China and all other countries around there all have something to gain from the instability.

If youre pissed off at Turkey, get mad at the rest too.
We all know Turkey has been funding rebels in Syria, but there's nothing to suggest those rebels are ISIS.  Hell, they've been specifically helping the Turkmen *against* ISIS.
 If there's one thing we can agree on, nobody should interfere with the arms' trade. 
Oh, is it secret that Turkey is backing the rebels in Syria who are attacking the Syrian gov't?  I thought that was common knowledge.

Why does reddit hate Erdogan so much?   He's no worse than Putin or many other leaders.
These so called "journalists" are treasonous traitors just as bad as Snowden, Assange, and Manning.
Hmm.
Great source. 

Stay classy r/worldnews. 
People are missing the point. The idea isn't too clone for meat production but instead clone to create the desired gene pool to THEN breed for meat. It saves 3-4 generations of breeding necessary to create herds of a specific  kind of cow. Want black Angus? Go to cloning facility and clone a starting herd rather than buy the sperm from a prize black Angus abroad, artificially inseminate your own cow, then in breed for 4 generations with that one bull until his offspring have the desired genes to start a herd. 
&gt;Building the world's largest  animal cloning factory.

Considering I'm sure there are no others, they could just have 1 moo cow in this factory. 
I can't see how this could be more cost effective then making cows the traditional way. But I am excited about the possibility of producing clones of wild harvested seafood that are currently overfished or highly demanded. Cloned bluefin tuna or vsrious species of lobster could have very positive outcomes for the protection of theses species natural populations.
Begun, the clone wars have.
"Our cows were naturally birthed" - future restaurant signs in Brooklyn 
i'd have no issues eating cloned meat.

not quite sure it really matters if 2 cows had a roll around in the hay or if my sirloin was custom made in a test tube.
Let them. People will follow but we will learn from their mistakes. Pioneering when someone else is doing it is a waste of resources. Once they have a good method and you feel safe consuming it and people realize it's value if any, just emulate until you have a better option. 


ELI5, How is this different from a regular animal farm?
The only thing I see is that there is little or no need for male breeder animals. But I can't think of a big economic effect on a production process because of it.
Serious question: will we ever get to the point where we could just grow a conglomeration of beef cells to the point where we could make ground beef in a dish? It would be pretty cool if we could just clone the cells, it could save time, money, and the ethical problems of growing animals whose only purpose is to die.

Edit: thanks for the great read folks! I can't believe I missed when that happened

Serious question - Why clone, when you can apparently [lab grow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro_meat) meat? If [Gizmodo says it](http://gizmodo.com/the-future-will-be-full-of-lab-grown-meat-1720874704), it has to be right! 
Initially I read this as animal clothing factory... not awake enough for reddit yet apparently.
China is accused of not innovating. Not pushing the boundaries. Only copying what the west does. Here they *are* pushing the boundaries and, as is typical of westerners, the criticism floods in.
Something that wasn't quite clear here to me;

Is this cloned meat as in the whole animal is cloned and then slaughtered? 

Or is this cloned meat as in they're growing/cloning stretches of muscle tissue into a steak like form? [\(like this\)](http://gizmodo.com/the-future-will-be-full-of-lab-grown-meat-1720874704)
We (The West) are going to look really fucking stupid to an outsider if we take up some bullshit moral objection to producing and cloning meat, with all the other insane shit we don't bat an eye at.
ITT: people who really don't understand cloning. 
wana hear a joke ? Vice news. 
China has actual leadership.  And a long and delightful custom of executing executives who f*ck up.  All in all a recipe for success.
Welp looks like it's time to learn Mandarin.  Not like the US will be around a lot longer the way the "Generation of Feeling Offended" is going.
Take the patty, clone it, then voila, a double cheeseburger. Then you have to clone the cheese. 
And it was on that day that Angus looked at his brothers and realized that it was him, they were all him, humans have decide he was their food, not just his species, but him, he had died a million deaths and he would die a million more and there was nothing he could ever do about it,..        

How is cloning more efficient than breeding?
It's not as if the livestock we breed now can survive nature without our assistance, so what is the long-term harm of cloning stubs like we do with seedless fruit? The unknown effects on other, higher-classed, species??

If any country cared about the general direction of genetics for any/all species then they'd put a stop to selecting for animals with the most useful market value.
Came to find out how I feel about this.
is this easier somehow?  you still have to implant the embryo?  Still have to gestate, give birth, and raise the animal to full size?

is cloning and implanting easier than the current way (which I assume involves a bull fluffer and a turkey baster)


If this goes horribly wrong it could solve the overpopulation problem.
I don't see what the problem is...
It's interesting how people seem to accept this, but when it comes to GMO vegetables they loose their minds.  
The article elaborates that they're mostly about cloning "great specimens" of whatever discipline: prized cows, provably capable rescue dogs, insanely expensive race-horses etc.
The title is stupid, while high quality meat will be a product of the factory, it is not to "feed the masses" and is not about quantity at all.
EDIT: And to the people in the comment chain below, it would really help if you actually read the article instead of throwing assumptions at each other and then arguing about them.
I'm not sure I understand how this is better than normal breeding. Cloned embryos still have to be raised normally, fed, etc. What's the huge upside? 

Added: worked on a medium sized pig farm many years ago, I can tell you that lack of genetic diversity causes Soooo many abnormalities. New strain sperm was purchased often. 
And creating herds of identically genetic animals won't result in devastating diseases because....?

I thought genetic diversity was the reason why it's hard for epidemics to form.
Can they clone rhinos and tigers for their ridiculous traditional medicine while they're at it?
i only eat animals that fucked each other
Begun, the clone wars have.
Factory farming accounts for 37% of methane (CH4) emissions, which has more than 20 times the global warming potential of CO2..How can anyone think this is a good idea?
Are animals subjects or objects?

We, as a society, should determine this before conducting such operations. 
Veganism would be a better option. I'm not trying to be annoying here. I am serious. It is far more viable 
China ends world hunger?
I'm very wary of this. Eating meat has tremendous negative impacts on the planet and greatly enlarges our species' carbon and ecological footprint. We need to be drastically reducing our meat consumption, not inventing new ways to eat more of it. To me this seems a huge step backward in terms of sustainability.
Incredibly, footage from the Chinese factory has already been leaked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt4ZvcUVz5s
How i read this title:

&gt;While everyone else is worried about archaic things like "ethics" and "safety," China is all, "Fuck that noise," and charges in head first, long dick style.
Wait, why would cloning be easier than breeding the animals? 

I mean cloning is currently nothing else than impregnating animals with an egg that has been filled with the DNA of an adult to create a genetic copy. At no point does it produce more animals with less food or anything like that.
Good.

edit: Wow, thanks for the gold!
Munchies.vice 

Lol
So in 10 years even our animal will be made in China....hmmmm
2016 is in a month. Fuck.
Well, we tried this with things like banana's, which are now all genetically clones of themselves. They're going to go extinct because of the lack of genetic diversity. We could fuck this up so it happens to cows too. Maybe.
Reminds me of a Katt Williams skit talking [about cloned meat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eTDxjATwGc)
Not surprising considering China holds around 1/5 of the worlds population.
Good for them. Luv me some cloned meat.
This is why they ended the one child policy.

Chinese food becomes very Chinese.
Now we can get steak that's made in China
"Xu is 'pretty' confident that comes animals are safe to eat."  I'd eat a slice of that kind of confidence. 
Cloning doesn't seem like it's all that helpful. Ok, so you clone animals that are particularly good at converting food to edible meat. That gets you what, a 15% improvement over the average of the breed? I can't imagine it's an enormous jump, you still have to feed them.

It seems like it would be far more effective to pour resources into "frankenmeat", i.e. growing meat from tissue cultures. There are still advancements to be made on flavor and productivity, but the endgame of more food with less waste, less antibiotic use, and less disease spread has a much higher upside.
GMOOOO
My clone is 10 years old right now. In 10 more years once the clone is more developed to the extent an adult brain can be transplanted I will go to China for the harvest and have my brain transplanted into the clone. The clone's brain will be preserved for future use in the event it is needed.
Well, for cattle, it seems like a waste, but for seafood, maybe there will be a good market. I think we need to reserve judgment until we see the results. Then we can applaud or bash the decision. 
It seems ethical but why can't they breed animals as humans have successfully done for thousands of years instead of going to the trouble of cloning?
My cousin clones animals for a living.. Mainly prize cattle and sheep, etc. over in Brazil. He has in fact though done pets for people here in the US. I Lived with him for about a month or so, It was kind of weird getting a dry ice package from ups, opening it and finding a cats ear.  
But anyways, I digress. He tried explaining to me how cloning beef and other foods is very, very advantageous to us as humans. It allows us to create a perfect food, free from any of the "bad stuff".. But what do I know, science talk makes my head hurt usually. I probably didn't even understand half what he was trying to explain to me.
So... Potato famine issues right? Won't they all be susceptible to exactly the same deseases?
Isn't monoculture a generally bad idea?  We should be going towards more genetic diversity in our food supply, not less.  Now we struggle to contain pandemics that attack entire food crops or animal breeds.
I think we in the West need to stop worrying so much about ethics since we do so, so selectively.
Won't infection, disease, and overall sickness of animals increase if you have clones living with other clones? Won't they all have similar immune systems that are susceptible to the same pathogens?
I don't care what they do, cloning has no cons only pros. 
When will china learn people can eat people ;)
Am I the only one that hates these repetitive titles?
Does this mean we get wagyu cattle that doesn't cost $400 bucks a serving?
We are at risk of not having any bananas because we clone them and they have no genetic diversity. Basically a single virus could wipe all stocks. Isn't there the same risk with cloning animals? How are they going to reduce or eliminate this risk? 
I have a ton of dialects to learn before our occupation.
how much for a clone of scarlett johansson?
They will clone rhinos and clobber the ivory market.
With TPP soon to be a reality, it's good to know where our food(s) is coming from thanks to China!
They need to be cloning air filters.  
Great. Lets destroy the planet even more...

Yes China is such a bastion of foresight, ingenuity and promise for the future. I expect catastrophy.
Anyone else think there was some redundancy in the title?
Breed them to be eaten or clone them to be eaten I don't see the difference.


Next up, Russia now has a clone Bear Cavalry army
Editorialized? 
Is like monsanto but with animals
this is horrible! god meant for us to starve within the confines of nature. Whats next they gonna use stem cells to make people walk again or create a non rejectable organ transplants? to hell with you all! /s
Just to be clear - is China building a large animal-cloning factory? I don't believe the title was clear.
Did anyone else read the headline as a factory for cloning giant animals?
When you put emotions into work it doesn't turn out well, but when you clinically strive to somehow circumvent a problem, it becomes the complete opposite, China understood this first.
Mmmm... Chinese Food...  Thanks!!!!
Headed up by the same scientist who faked all his cloning results… This is just a PR move.
If they just outsourced animal patrol, there's enough stray dogs and cats over here that they wouldn't have to do this shit.
Fuck yea! Go China!

If something horrific happens as a result, the mutant death cows are far, far away from me. If it goes great, we all get to share the benefits.
Uhhh what? How does cloning help? You've still got to grow the animal and nature does a pretty good job of that. Why does it help to clone? 
Go science!
there is no good or bad, there is only consequence
Beats eating radroaches 
You are what you eat, as long as its done correctly it should be ok once stabilized. One of the most important things will be the other possibilities it can open up like cheaper mass produced human organs grown inside hybridized pigs which although currently in use cannot meet all the demand. This would save many lives and companies using such methods will likely be a great investment opportunity in the long run too
Up next, China clones Godzilla to get revenge on Japan.....

..and thus, the zombie apocalypse began.
Wait, who the hell is sorting out their feelings about cloned meat?  Did the author just make that up to create a sense of dramatic tension in the article?  It's just meat.
And we'll all be eating it since our meats don't require country of origin labels anymore.
Inb4 the vegans show up and start selling beans.
Don't forget the common banana we have that many cows being cloned we are likely to fight a race of space-faring cows.
China is going to create a clone army, and possibly take over the world?
But PETA activist tamper with the cloning process and create super smart cows who rebel against their cloning overlords. The cows fight their way out of the centers and establish a colony of smart cows who eventually take terrorist action against Mega cow farming corporations.
I think when you have millions set to starve in the future ethics can take a seat in the back. People need food. 
They can clone all the sushi they want it still wont taste good

Breeding high quality cows to clone Garry Busey, we could take over the world.

I just want to say that this would be an issue whether we're talking about cloned animals in order to make silk and tea through espionage and deceit for their own benefit.
Can we get us a mammoth burger yet ?
I find it interesting that this perfectly coincides with 9 months after the date of which the 1 baby policy would have been lifted. :D
When Jesus actually does come back this easter, he's gonna be pissed.
Wouldn't lack of genetic diversity make whatever animals they're working with more susceptible to disease? And isn't China one of the largest abusers of antibiotics, which contributes to antibiotic resistance? Seems like they're setting themselves up for collapse.  
Good, that's what it's going to take for people to get over this kind of thing.  Someone just doing it.
I'm not seeing the long-term benefit here.

Cloned pets, yeah, those'll sell. You just need to create a clone that's good enough and wishful thinking will take care of the rest.

Cloned livestock, you're going to run into serious issues when it turns out your genetic material is susceptible to a particular disease. And are they planning on selling single breeding examples for farms to expand their herds with, or do you buy a cloned herd wholesale? If the former, there's little reason to pick the clone over a regular high-quality cow. If the latter, I don't see where the added value is going to come from.

Frankly this sounds more like grandstanding to sell boutique 'clone' pets than a business plan.
&gt;sorts out its feelings about the safety and ethics

so edgy, Vice. Just when we thought you'd gone vanilla, huh?
I'm reminded of that movie Cloud Atlas...
If our president tries to place an order of cloned soldiers, then we know what's about to go down
HAVE WE LEARNED NOTHING FROM THE MEWTWO INCIDENT???!??
As noble as this all sounds, I for some reason can't help but think this is going to cause some sort of super virus or something. Bird flu, mad cow, H1N1, inbred donkey balls disease etc...
I'm glad someone is doing this.

The West is paralyzed by stupid Luddites.
China was careful to acknowledge that human cloning is actually illegal.  And thank god for that.  If you think all Chinese people looked the same *before*. 

can we just let the world population drop back to 4 billion ish? we keep saying there's no jobs and food is becoming difficult to keep up producing since we eat so much animal protein. We don't need to maintain the replacement rate, we need to let the population drop. 1 generation just needs to take it easy with having kids. If we continue at this rate in 100 years we'll be eating bugs just to keep everyone fed.
I don't think cloning an animal is any more unethical than eating it. I eat meat all the time but let's be real, slaughtering a cow is straight up murdering a creature with a consciousness and a capacity for happiness and suffering. If dogs had the same quantity of meat we'd be eating them too. 
What could possibly go wrong?!
China is fucked up. We are approaching the ability to GROW MEAT DIRECTLY without animals, and China fucking just wants to clone animals so they can kill more. Unsustainable and stupid.
[deleted]
It is funny that the title references China now as a sophisticated nation as they "solve the hunger problem". Where the most simple solution would be not to eat animal products at all.
I haven't read the article, but I take issue with this from the post title (the first full paragraph in the article):

&gt; While the rest of the world sorts out its feelings about the safety and ethics of cloning animals for food production

For many people, this isn't a matter of "feelings", but of logic and ethics. For example, from what I've read we don't really understand the health implications. 
They are not the first to do this sort of thing. The Irish did so in the eighteenth century when they adopted the practice of cutting potatoes in half and replanting them. From this two new plants would sprout but they were genetically identical. This lack of genetic variation left them vulnerable to potato blight and, coupled with government mismanagement at all levels, the [Great Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_%28Ireland%29) was the result.

China's livestock will become similarly vulnerable and to counter this antibiotics will be used more than ever, resulting in broad antibiotic resistance in human transmissible diseases - a perfect storm of plague and famine. War and Death will ride hot on their heels.
Why is china always the ones who pioneer and invent amazing new technology?
I fail to see how this will work. Because as far as I know, you can't clone something and then let it grow into maturity before "harvesting"; it gets "born" and then needs to grow up, just like regular animals need to do. Or am I mistaken in this?
I wonder if it'll ever become ethically acceptable to consume meat from cloned humans
I don't know why but I read that headline and all I can think of is - "This is Rupture Farms. They say it's the biggest meat processing plant on Oddworld."
Can somebody ELI5 how this is a cheaper and/or more efficient food production method than farming?
Can tell I haven't had enough coffee yet.  I read that twice before I realized it wasn't "Animal Clothing Factory"
I dont know how much more efficient it is to clone cows as oppose to breeding them
We all know how dangerous monocultures can be. This is just begging for the next big virus to appear.
Clones = parasites = failure. 

Insufficient genetic diversity invites evolutionary backlash.  You cannot escape this fact no matter how much money you spend or how brilliant your scientists think they are.

In the near-immortal words of Laurence Fishburne "You think you can beat the system?  Well this is the system beating you back!"
You can't compromise safety and ethics; two wongs don't make a right!
Hopefully this will be just a stepping stone to where we can directly make meat without the animal raising and slaughtering.
Good for them, ahead of the curve.
Yeah, fuck safety and ethics.
Didn't Shanghai just have a public warning for their local air population levels. 

Yes, China please charge ahead and scale your agriculture like you have your emissions. Sounds like a fantastic idea. 
I always wonder if the true concern is really ethics or profit.

If you own some prize steers where you can sell the semen for millions, you're gonna be shitting yourself at the thought of Mr. China coming along and creating 50 prize bulls with near perfect reliability.
When you have no ethics, everything is possible.
Don't worry. China's Animal Rights groups will march in the streets to stop this. They'll call their elected representatives and complain, just like they do in North Korea.
Holy shit just stop eating meat, these cloned animals will still use up resources. God am I glad that I won't be alive anymore to see the real mess we'll be in. Or just barely.
[deleted]
wow, that's a title with an agenda if I've ever seen one.
Begun... the Clone Wars has.
After all of the accidents and mishaps we've seen from China, both minor and major, there is absolutely no way any of this can or will go wrong.  I can guarantee both people and animals will benefit from this, and there is absolutely nothing to worry about here.
Things you can accomplish when you ignore religious people's  ideology. Funny how everyone is trying to sustain their own nations while we become more dependant on others due to our desire for cheap goods and politicians who feed on this/sell us out 
Are people bitching about animal rights? Starving humans come first.
the rest of the world is not sorting out feelings about safety and ethics of factory farms..one doesn't have to look any further than beyond the US borders..nobody and the population doesn't care... a youtube video will pop up and there's OMG's..and then population munches on their $5 nuggets and $1 hamburgers 
china....fuck yeah we got this cloning shit going, lets solve world hunger and progress, its a wonderful future we have here.


rest of the world...mumble mumble god mumble mumble its not natural mumble mumble jesus jesus mumble.



Ridiculous.  In what universe is it more cost effective to *clone* animals than to simply *breed* them?

Something else is afoot here--this makes no sense.
Is this like all those other unbelievable projects China claims they're gonna accomplish? Like the high speed rail line running from Shanghai to Paris, or the mile high skyscraper built in a month, or the green city built next to Shanghai?
1) China's agricultural 'problems' are of their own creation. China could easily feed its own population using the agricultrual base it had before. The problem is that they essentially polluted and poisoned every square inch of farm land and water way they could find to power their industiral complex.  They are essentailly creating a very expensive way to create meat, because they destroyed the easy and more economical way of doing it, farming.

2) Note this is China. A country who's food safety protocols are so bad pharmacies in the Netherlands can't stock baby formula because the Chinese buy it in bulk and ship it back to China. Where people sell 'vegetable oil' made from sewage waste that's essentially been strained through some cheese cloth. A supply chain so bad even McDonalds cant source actual 'meat'.
I find it hilarious how moral mountaineers sitting in the comfort of their beautiful and incredible western homes have the spine to question the ethics of something like this. What are they supposed to do, let tens of millions of their people starve to death? Until you come up with a better alternative, climb down from your high horse and keep your mouth shut.
Why go to all that trouble when you can just eat plants instead? It's far cheaper, healthier and less cruel. 
Why is it that "Jews" have the stereotype of being cheapskates and not the Chinese?  I've always wondered.
So even Chinese animals are going to be cheap knockoffs?
From an ethical (and not an environmental) perspective are we not just shifting suffering of 'normal' animals onto the cloned ones? Shouldn't we be investing in lab grown meat instead, considering that its now within the realm of possibility?
I'm born Chinese and lived in China last year for a good six months. One great thing (and downside) of China is, when it wants something done, it just does it. No political gridlock. No argument of ethics. No care of "feelings hurt". No care of political correctness. No two parliaments arguing non-stop and ideology. 

Just get shit done.

I love it. 
How about cloning some of the White Rhinos you people have almost wiped out with your insane demand for voodoo doctor medicines. 
Clone elephants so you can stop killing the wild ones for your dong powder
Why don't they just use that people cloning factory they have?
[deleted]
They're going to fuck it completely up. 
I thought that said ant cloning facility for a minute.  

I mean, I know you got to eat but if your cloning you could pick something better than ants for the dinner table.
All the "ethical standards" we have in the west are derived from Western Christian standards. China is an atheist totalitarian state. They get shit done and who cares what the "ethical" effects are. The only ethics of true raw science is: "see what is possible, then do it."
China always gonna do China.
While the rest of the world is sorting out the safety and health issues of doing something like this, China has no choice because of the situation they have put themselves in.
I'm curious to know if the same technology can be used to help endangered animals. One comment pointed out the clone needs to be inserted in a mother. With that in mind, can we save species by cloning?
Have they seen no movie ever?! We all know there's going to be that one cow who refuses to accept his reality of being unoriginal and thus will convince and free all other cows...dramatically.

Duh China.
They've been cloning pets for awhile. I saw a documentary somewhere that China was making big bucks cloning peoples dead pets
It's got to be better than msg-flavored cardboard.
While I am undecided whether cloning is a good idea, edible insects are ready alternate cheap protein.
This will be food for the plebes. The rich will still eat the good meat and observe what happens to the plebes. 
This is just a cover for their plan to clone an army of Yao Mings.
This sounds like the plot of a B horror movie.

EDIT: I'd like to add that the movie would be rated L.
Thats an Amazing idea with a pretty quick start up time, Thats good though because 1 day starving is probably a long painful amount of time. I'd rather have cloned animals and all the issues and trouble there if it alleviate human starvation.
Immortal pets, anyone?
This is front page material.... I thought reddit was all anti GMO...

This goes way way way beyond GM Fruits and vegetables. 

Also considering a cloned animal still needs to be birthed what's the benefit over normal breeding? 
This title is so repetitive..
I didn't read the article, but are they cloning whole animals, like live animals?

Or is this like the whole growing meat from stem cells thing?

I'd absolutely eat a steak grown from stem cells, hell I'd eat a cloned animal too. Fuck it, if it once had a face, i'll eat it.
Still waiting for someone to crossbreed food animals with human DNA so we can create a race of self-sufficient food sources.
What's next?  Some sort of clone army?

&gt; After about five days in operation, Isdarat has largely stayed down, out, and inaccessible, no longer a working hub for ISIS media.

&gt; The Isdarat franchise has been a powerful propaganda tool for ISIS but also a constant target of attacks, hence the move to perceived safety of the Dark Net.

&gt; As part of a coordinated post-Paris media campaign, ISIS supporters are producing multiple videos, infographics, and audio recordings daily that are then broadcast out to the world through networks like Twitter and Telegraph, even as both networks attempt to squash ISIS accounts as rapidly as they pop up.

HACK THE PLANET
Oh man, they will never survive on the deep dark web...Tor is patrolled by the most savvy of freedom loving peeps
How can it be propaganda if it's hidden? 
ppl make fun of hackers and anon and shit but they are doing a lot more than most to try to prevent terrorism
Not gonna lie, first time I heard about Anonymous declaring "war" on ISIS I thought they couldn't do shit. Looks like some people are actually trying to help.

Relevant xkcd: https://xkcd.com/932/
This article claims the U.S government largely funds the Dark Net. Does anybody have a source or any more information on this? Because that is a very large claim to make without any supporting evidence. 
Can someone ELI5 the dark net please?
Wait, so Tor is funded by the US government?
See, this is what hackers should be doing.
Can not tell how much i am impressed by those hackers, i really hope they continue doing good work.
Pfft "hackers". Nothing 'hacky' about ddosing, at all- whatsoever.
Come back to me when they have server access
"ISIS's"...

*ISISIS?*
How do people even find shit on the dark net? All I've found is drugs and fake assassins. I want to find cool shit. 
Anon should be the direct replacement of the NSA as the NSA doesn't do anything worth a fuck to thwart danger. 
I wish hackers could fry the hard drives and completely destroy whatever devices are sharing this Pro Isis shit online. I'm no hacker, but I bet its possible 
If the CIA was smart, they'd hack the daylights out of Daesh and claim to be anonymous. People are weary of the US directly intervening and US hacking won't go over well. Meanwhile it'll make Anonymous look like a powerful branch of public opinion and control. It's the people of the world versus Daesh. It's also be demoralizing because Daesh views Anonymous as a bunch of nerdy losers who are all talk and no bite.
Buzzwords: Hackers, ISIS, Dark Net, propaganda
How did they compromise a TOR hidden site?
Article from Gizmodo taking issue with Anon's current activities.

I'll just leave this here for you guys to read and give your opinions on.

[Gizmodo's article](http://gizmodo.com/anonymous-is-really-screwing-up-its-stupid-war-on-isis-1744170852)
Do they really know what they are doing? I mean, it might be an obstacle for the survey isn't it? 
Unfortunately, I read just recently that these independent attacks on ISIS' social media &amp; other communication routes aren't helping.  

The reason is that intelligence agencies have been monitoring those accounts for intelligence.  Every time hackers shut one down, their "window" into ISIS moves and they have to find it again.  Eventually, ISIS will find a channel that the hackers can't find (e.g., chat session inside a game,) and the intelligence communities may not be able to find it either.

Maybe the real question is the crux of the claims so as to not let the offenders know you can obviously manipulate the enemy in interesting and effective ways.
That brings us to a definitive, de facto rebuttal of the deep web is not part of the main projects.
New people are walking into a very large claim to make without any supporting evidence.
There's more to it than that, but those are the same people who orchestrate the public announcement videos.
Mr The Plague and I was running out of air for a few of their media stuff.
The circumstances under which a period ends a sentence unless the previous word is the end of a sentence, unlike the rest of our silly language, are pretty consistent.
I would love to hack for the US but they put up too many barriers.
more good news
I can't decide if this is a good thing or a bad thing. I can see how it would be good for stemming their propaganda and recruitment, but wouldn't these hubs be extremely valuable sources of information for  government intelligence agencies that are surely already monitoring them?

Someone convince me one way or the other.
I wonder how much this is effecting our intelligence agencies data mining on all stuff that's getting taken out. 
why didnt the us government do this?
Are you supposed to say the least.
I totally agree with you but I honestly think that example is too one-sided to be the work of anonymous.
I thought ghost security was the group that was doing real hacking and providing the authorities with details to thwart attacks. "Anonymous" recently attacked the twitter accounts and ddos of sites, etc. This article seems to not quite have their facts straight. 
How did they compromise a TOR hidden site?
They can make another one, in 10 seconds.

You guys were championing how great the piratebay was at doing this, and you forget anyone can do this?
In reality, how long would the site really be down for? I imagine they have backups of the site content. Isn't this just really a minor inconvenience more than anything? If not, please explain, I'd love to know more.
As if this will do anything. 
Anonymous, Hackers, Al-Quaeda, everyone is doing something except the US. Why do all these other organizations seem to have a greater impact than our own country or president? It astonishes me how people can not see how terrible our president is at foreign policy/middle east.
You would think someone capable of accessing the darknet would know better than to join a terror group.
This reminds me of the takedown of Islam4UK when people got together, converted a url bar javascript refresh code and then posted it repeatedly on the 'soldiers are heroes' facebook groups till the hosted took the site down
Good job hackers

“Hackers knock out ISIS's Dark Net propaganda site”
Nice idea guys, but are you not overlooking an old but true saying? “It is better to remain silent and have others suspect that you are a fool, than it is to speak up and confirm that beyond all doubt”. So although posing these individuals simple queries, would not act to force-ably impose another equally erroneous ideology upon their consciousness. It could cause them to contradict their own understanding, using their very own words coming from their very own mouths. In short, a delusional mindset is much like a swelling. Lancing it is a lot more effective a treatment, than swaddling it in bandages like a mummy. Drawing the poison out more healing, than sealing up all the orifices in an attempt to keep it in. Because they interpret that approach as evidential proof that they are right in the head, although beset by the insane. Letting them show otherwise is the best way forward.

ISIS can't stay out of the news. Al Qaeda must be so jealous.
Tor is "*largely funded by the US government*"? Is it really secure then?

Another thing we should do, is stop writing about them except when they perform atrocities. 
Was this done by Anonymous? If so it is weird that they name is not mentioned at all in the article. If it wasn't them then who did?
that's nice and all but for all we know ISIS's "Dark Net propaganda site" was put together by 2 bored tweens in Hackensack

really wanna do some good?  join someone's army, go over there and shoot them.

This article says ISIS is "famously Internet savvy." 
"knock out" like its a machine gun nest or a bunker
I would have prefer to make it into a staining/watering-hole attack. Mark those who visit it and then hopefully CNE into them and so on. Taking it down just puts all the dumbass users on notice that they are being actively targeted.
Imagine being that person who was on the cusp of a major breakthrough of identifying the operators and their collaborators from the intelligence posted; Only to have it brought down by the misguided thinking they were helping. Just imagine their anger and the despair of not being able to say anything about it to anyone, ever.  

Does it happen? Sure. Did it happen here? We'll probably never know. I just can't in good conscience allow myself to take that risk.
Nice
now try infiltration 
Is anon even a thing anymore ? I thought the real dudes all got locked up or are working for the govt ??? 
Was it a hacker known as 4chan?
Can someone explain what/how the dark net works?
Haha, you can't kill isdarat.

IS combat/execution videos will never be successfully censored from the internet as long as collectors and gore addicts exist.
Worked great against Reddit It would be easier to monitor for the NSA or CIA contributing code in their web logs, and for security during sting operations.
They took out salon.com?
Team America fuck yea!

The most upvoted opinion the entire internet can give on this subject is a fucking TLDR bot. 
Let's hope Turkish government doesn't go after the Hackers for attacking ISIS, like they went after the Russian jet  attaching ISIS.  The jet violated their air space for 17 seconds (or some seconds) and even that is contested as the rockets fell in Syria airspace (confirmed). So basically Turkey will look for excuse to go after anyone supporting ISIS. World beware.
lets piss off pissed off people,what could go wrong.
Guys, what about freedom of speech? Hating what they say but defending their right to say it? GUYS?!
All you hackers out there need to focus on matters that do not involve ISIS. Or I will find you and make sure you never hack another fucking thing again.

*****
&gt; After poring over the treaty&amp;#039;s final text, the businessman who helped build Research In Motion into a $20-billion global player said the deal contains &amp;quot;Troubling&amp;quot; rules on intellectual property that threaten to make Canada a &amp;quot;Permanent underclass&amp;quot; in the economy of selling ideas.

&gt; Balsillie said parts of the deal will harm Canadian innovators by forcing them to play by rules set by the treaty&amp;#039;s most-dominant partner: the United States.

&gt; Balsillie&amp;#039;s concerns about the deal include how it would impose intellectual property standards set by the U.S., the biggest partner in the treaty.

What a terrible article. I was actually interested about the things they were saying, and it made no mention of any specifics. Oh so the TPP is going to cost Canada billions due to "ideas"? What? It would be nice if they tried to explain that, with examples or something, I mean they are just the media... 
Except that Harper didn't do it.  The new parliament will vote on it.  If it passes, you can blame the Liberals for it.
Bill C51 was the worst thing the Harper government has done.
Good thing that Trudeau will not let it pass.

Oh, wait, he supports it.

Shit.
How can this be the worst thing Harper has done?  It hasn't been ratified yet!

All Harper did was continue the negotiations and get the deal provisionally passed, as did the leader of every other country who is involved.  This is how trade deals of this magnitude work, necessarily.  If Canadians don't want it, then the current Liberal government will reject it on their behalf.  If that doesn't happen, it's *Trudeau* that's done this "worst thing for Canada."

And this:

&gt; It’s a treaty that structures everything forever — and we can’t get out of it.

Is palpably false.  We can get out of it easily, as the article explains a few sentences later:

&gt; It would require a parliamentary vote in Canada.

So if Canada doesn't want the trade deal, it can get out of it easily: **don't ratify it.**

When I see things like this--rampant misinformation, rank ignorance posing as sage wisdom, political bias pretending to standards of journalistic objectivity, and non-experts cloaking themselves in the garb of legal and international trade expertise--combined with the vast majority of people who uncritically swallow it whole... well, it makes me weep for the future prospects of Western democracy.
I find Balsillie's thoughts funny. His company is renowned for not being able to adapt to the changing demands on cellular devices. Yet, here he is trying to protect Canadian companies' ability to adapt *slower than they already do!*
I wanna ask reddit - **has anyone actually read the TPP**? Or did 99% of you just read scaremongering stories from media saying "yadda yadda TPP is the worst thing ever" "hurr durr your internet freedom is gone"

Here's a few links that go full depth into the TPP. **It does look very similar to EU mind you.**
https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3rnsnm/eli5_full_text_of_tpp_what_it_means_to_the_people/

https://www.reddit.com/comments/3nl4sz/

https://ustr.gov/tpp/outlines-of-TPP

https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text


A few highlights of the TPP: 1. Lower tariffs generally (good for consumers and export-oriented producers, bad for industries that compete heavily with imports)


Signatories agree to enforce intellectual property restrictions for a longer period of time (good for pharmaceutical industry, bad for consumers of generic drugs. Internet freedom activists have also criticized the TPP for its potential to entrench and expand US copyright law)


It weakens protectionism in the auto industry, like the North American content rules (bad for US auto industry, good for Japan)


It enhances labor mobility so it is easier to move within TPP countries


It includes labor rights clauses, restricting child labor, forced labor, etc. (this will prevent people from challenging labor laws as protectionist measures, and may raise the standards of some developing country signatories slightly)


Ends some forms of agricultural protectionism in Japan and Canada (bad for Canadian dairy farmers and some Japanese farmers, good for consumers and producers elsewhere).


It also contains an environmental chapter, which has received more criticism than the labor rights chapter as far as I've seen.


It will establish an investor-state dispute mechanism (some critics argue this will elevate corporations and enable them to undermine national sovereignty, while defenders point out that most trade agreements have such provisions, and the TPP has included an opt-out for tobacco regulations, after the Australian experience).


The TPP will likely boost GDP among the 12 prospective signatories (US, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Chile, Australia and New Zealand). But the gains range widely. Because the US is already a large diversified economy, its projected gains from trade are smaller - only about $78 billion. Vietnam, in contrast, is projected to see an 11% boost to GDP.


Of course, not everybody stands to gain equally. Consumers gain pretty unambiguously from having a greater access to cheaper goods. Workers in some industries stand to lose as they face greater competition abroad, while others stand to gain from access to new markets.


In some countries, however, there are provisions in place to help those displaced by trade treaties. The US has Trade Adjustment Assistance, for instance. And in the Canadian election, Stephen Harper pledged billions to the auto and dairy industry (though it is up to Trudeau as to whether he follows through).


Some of the other implications of the treaty are harder to sort out in a balance sheet type manner. There may be geopolitical implications, as the US strengthens trade ties with many ASEAN countries, plus Japan. The treaty may pose risks to the environment. And certainly for consumers of generic drugs, this is probably not a good treaty.




And nowhere does this person explain *why* they are so opposed to it.  
The entire article is just various ways to suggest its a bad deal with no examples to back that up. 
If you read the local news for every country involved in the TPP, it would appear that the TPP is the worst thing for every country involved.
I find it funny how so many people have such a strong opinion on something they don't even understand. Hell, even the experts can't tell exactly how this deal is going to change the current situation.
Maybe we should just exercise critical thinking instead of screaming for or against the TPP every time it is mentioned.
Stupid question, if 2 or 3 large nations back out, what happens to the deal?
They played us like a damn fiddle!
&gt; TPP deal ‘worst thing that Harper government has done ~~for~~ to Canada’: Balsillie

Fixed
Since everyone is demonstrating how screwed they are by TPP--who is the 'big winner' in this deal then??  Who is smiling all the way to the bank?
I swear I will lose faith in Trudeau really quickly if they let this pass.  Even more so if they try to pull a smoke and mirrors show and legalize pot at the same time.
confused...

'“I’m worried and I don’t know how we can get out of this,” said Balsillie'

and then there is...

"It would require a parliamentary vote in Canada"

so which is it?
https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific-partnership/tpp-full-text

A link to the document in question. I thought it may be useful since I didn't see any direct quotations from it here or in the article itself. 

I am still in the dark in terms of what in the document actually causes the damage let alone how. I want to find it, but I don't even know where to start looking.
I always feel like TPP topics should be upvoted to hell and back but they only get like 100.
I'd like to point out that this was said by the co-CEO of RIM (blackberry) who was booted out of the position in 2012 and was involved in a lot of controversial [shenangians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackBerry_Limited#Controversies) so personally, I'll take his word with a grain of salt.
And Justin Trudeau supported TPP just like he did with the keystone pipeline. 
TTP TLDR

It's not fair to say the TPP is a disaster or a magic bullet, it's a hazy mix of good and bad. Here are some highlights from the text.

Keep in mind, the TPP is between Australia, Brunei, Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, Vietnam, Japan, and the US and still must be ratified by all 12.

**The Good**

- You can hopefully expect **cheaper things**. That's at least the goal, things from cars from Japan to livestock from Canada will be cheaper. 

- The deal has a measure that **prevents currency manipulation**, so countries can't just devalue their currency and make our goods seem artificially expensive (this is one way China dominates our market). This should create a fairer trade landscape and make some American goods more competitive.
- It can **reduce our trade deficit**. Only products actually made in america (It think it has to be 60% American made?) qualify for TPP reduced trade barriers, hopefully encouraging domestic manufacturing.
- I'm putting **workers rights** here for now. The TPP has provisions against child labor and working discrimination, but it's vague and I'm not sure how good they actually are.

**The Bad**

- If you are a business owner, tariffs that protect the goods you make are probably going down, and they are on "schedules" that will be phased out over a 8-10 years or so. This will probably **destroy some American businesses**, especially those in niche markets that make a specific part that could be produced easier somewhere else. 
- In writing this deal, each country had it's main motivations. Japan wanted to sell us automobile parts, Canada wanted to export more livestock, and the US, well, wanted more control of **intellectual property**. The US demanded from participating countries that films, books, and trademarks like Micky Mouse live for the life of the author + 70 years. This is a long time, but keep in mind in most countries it's already life of the author + 50 years. For example, MLK's speeches won't be available until 2038.
- The TPP establishes outside enforcement **tribunals** which allow companies to sue governments for interfering with profits. It's not technically a court, and keep in mind the only real power of the tribunal is to expel a country from the TPP and the supposed benefits it provides. So for example, Phillip Morris (the cigarette company) already filed a suit against Uruguay for launching an anti-tobacco campaign. We'll see how this turns out, it's still going on.
- Big pharma gets a boost, **extending patent protection on life-saving drugs** for 8 years (which is more than the 5 that Canada has). This will make it harder to export generic brands, and is particularly bad for developing countries who will have less access to cheap medicine.

Keep in mind there are a lot of factors in this deal, and there's something for everyone to hate or like.
Do all countries involved in the treaty have to agree to it? If one country votes it down does the entire thing go up in flames or is that country just not involved in the deal? 
So I assume Harper is just gonna be the Canadian version of Thatcher/Bush II wherein the new government/media blames all of their failings on them for decades to come.
Never forget that from July-September Reddit blocked any TPP related articles from appearing on the front page. Corrupt media is corrupt
Lower down in this thread rich people support the TPP by saying what's good for the goose is good for the gander, AKA Trickle Down economics. You remember that, right, that's where the Rich piss on everyone below them and laugh about it.
How many of you actually know what TPP says?
It hasn't been voted on, so how's it Harper's fault? If it passes, it'll be Liberal's fault, not Harper's.
And we just elected a PM that fully supports the TPP.

Not that we had much choice, because they *all* supported the TPP.
Canada gets the worst of it when it comes to Intellectual Property, it basically forces US copyright law on them. For example, patents for film, books, and music will last the life of the author plus 70 years, and patents of potentially life-saving medicine will now last 8 years instead of Canada's previous 5.
One must realize that not the USA is going to benefit from this trade deal but the 1% of people that own half of the US economy. It is in their interest.
Trudeau is for it as well... and it wasn't passed in Harper's government. Let's not pass the buck on something that isn't final yet.
anyone who says we can't get out of this deal is a liar. Of course we can. 

*Trudeau now
just a reminder: I've got a dirty sock to eat if the libs don't pass this
Isn't the new government who everybody has been enthusiastically cheering as the second coming of christ responsible for signing off on it?
No facts or anything real in this article, just one man spouting his opinion and providing no real reason. How are the us's intellectual rights going to cost Canadian innovators? 
Never before have so many, watched so few, get away with so much !
"It’s such brilliantly systemic encirclement"

Someone needs to visit r/circlejerk
"We're dealing with a huge list here. Are you sure that's the worst thing he's done?" - Canada
According to the article, it's bad because it's too good for the Americans:

“It’s such brilliantly systemic encirclement. I’m just in awe at its powerful purity by the Americans…

“We’ve been outfoxed.”

Interesting that so many Americans (who'd never read the TPP) considered it to be the worst thing to ever happen.  Looks like they can relax now - we won.

So basically its a plan to make the rich even MUCH MORE richer than before, and completely fuck over the normal people. And if there are some actually good politicians who care about the people and vote against it, what stops multi billion companies to just bribe them behind the curtains? Like give them 100 Million $ to shut up and agree already, so they all can go and make even much more cash? I won't even be surprised if some politicians only vote against it to pressure the companies to get a piece of the cake in form of said payment. I don't know whats going on behind the curtain, but I'm not naive enough to believe that its anywhere near legal. Pretty sure that at this point, everyone involved laughs at the law, that "constitution" thing you guys are so proud of, and the human rights. This world is going to shit quicker and quicker. Don't let them get away with it.
And it will be the worst thing that Trudeau holds us to - other than C-51. Another Harper policy, funnily enough. 

It's almost as if there's no difference between the two leaders. 
So Reddit, will you hold Trudeau's feet to the fire when he goes along with it? 
So melodramatic.
Guy is just rattled the company he led into greatness has fallen into really really hard times and that he still doesn't own an NHL team

Nothing to see here folks
All the Conservative apologists that are saying the TPP is now the Liberals' fault are full of it. Harper engaged in the negotiations, he picked the team that would do so, he picked poorly according to Balsillie and he stuck us with the current situation. Its up to to Trudeau to decide if the government is in favour of it or not. I sincerely hope not.
US big corporations &amp; lobbyist wrote the TPP, government reps in their various departments in signatory countries simply signed us on without consult because of "secrecy" until just past days - what happens next will spell out trouble once it's ratified. This hasn't happened yet. 
my canadian friend tells me harper simply failed to connect with the canadian people, and wasn't so bad. but i do sense a lot of dissatisfaction with harper in environmental issues especially. or is this just a narrow p.o.v. if don't see the big picture?  
The proposed TPP agreement would be an antidemocratic encumberment limiting creativity in these times that call for adaptation because of increased threats (military, economic and climate). It shackles to rising corporate power and means the loss of people to organize in response to it. I would rather a world of nations than a world of monopolies.
And therefore the world 
Surely Jim is aware that Trudeau is the one who's signature will be on the final TPP and not Harper right?

No that's right he obviously isn't aware. Him, and all the other morons who Obama blame Harper for everything they don't agree with. 

And yet, they all have the same voting power as people who aren't complete morons. 

Who's gonna be the one to blame? The one who "thought of the dumb idea", or
the one "who approved the dumb idea"?
And Trudeau voted for it.
Yeah but WEED, dude.
It's already starting. I just got banned from r/philosophy for telling the idea that there is no free will to fuck off
Make a new Canada, transfer all the populace and such fromthe old Canada and leave the old with TPP, Harper and 1 square metre somewhere in the north.
Harper gave up Ontario's auto industry and Quebec ' s Dairy and passed the whole steaming turd to Trudeau. This is politics by suicide bomb. None of this is accidental. The conservatives will be campaigning on the salted fields they sowed with Trudeau weakened.

Just like c-51 the TPP was a poison pill designed to strategically hurt Canadians for Conservative gain. 
Every time I see TPP, I think its some toilet paper product or something
That's a pretty Balsillie thing to say. Get it, get it?

...but seriously, the TPP's a pretty sucky idea.
Holy shit can you give it a rest with the Harper hate..  Canada is in a better place then ever right now..  It's not like we have any choice whether we sign the tpp or not.  All the other countries are so if we didn't it would hurt us. If you want to blame someone for the tpp blame the US. For writing it and Trudeau for not stopping it
And Trudeau supports it.
Did people not read the text of this thing? Or was the language intentionally screwy? 
I'm not sure "for Canada" is the right phrasing.
But it's 2015! my canadian friend tells me harper simply failed to connect with the current Liberal government will reject it on their behalf.
No comment on the TPP, but Balsillie also destroyed a $20 billion company that was once the prime innovator in the smartphone market.

Not sure we should be listening to him as an expert on innovation after Blackberry became so stagnant.
I am fine with the TPP, it looks like it will benefit most of the Canadian industries, even dairy farmers have backed it after goverment fought to keep Canada's system of supply management in tact. 
Has it been ratified? If not, doesn't the Trudeau government have a chance to anally fuck it legislatively?
even worse than the Labour Market Impact Assessment, which has made it damn near impossible for even highly qualified immigrants to permanently settle in Canada? Really hope Trudeau can abolish that bullshit-his father understood that immigrants are the backbone of Canada
With this agreement in place it's going to be hard to sell any BlackBerrys in the US. 
"For" Canada? How about "To" Canada?
I'm glad I've never had to see a good thing about conservatives here on reddit. 
ball is life?

There was a good discussion on the TPP today, on  
[NPR's planet money.](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/)
I'm sorry but I'm going to need a better business man's opinion. Is Jim Treliving available for comment? That dude's cool as fuck.
Not the worst but one of the worst
I do agree on the problems this will cause to intellectual property but I guess people are also missing the other big point of this thing. Also, Harper is not the one who's gonna vote on it.
*done to canada 
Does anyone mind giving me a ELI5 down-low of what this TPP deal is exactly?
No one is smiling all the standing MPs and their parties, but it all started with the current situation.
Oh like they wouldn't have approved it with any establishment politician.
Not all of their stance on the issue precisely because they all supported the TPP.
Don't forget CKFTA which according to Harper props, will create thousands of jobs for Canadians....Like...Ones of thousands!
But Harper was against TPP, and if it passes it isn't the "Harper government's" fault.
one of many
We only need one country to not pass the TPP for it to not be implemented for any of the countries right? Please Canada, save us. You and useless Republican obstructionism are our only hopes!
You had to know that a story like this was going to come out. Every single trade agreement will almost certainly have almost as much con as there is pro. 

So with a little digging, any reporter could find someone pissed off about something.

Each country entering the TPP had to realize that they had to give a little in some areas, in order to get a little in others. So they each set their own goals for what they would like to be their country's strength coming out of the TPP.

It seems according to this article, Harper did not emphasize Canada's intellectual development as much as other things. This may or may not be a bad thing. I don't really know the details of the TPP, but maybe Harper focused on natural resources over intellectual property. And maybe this point of emphasis will have the best positive net impact for Canada in the long run.  

Then again, maybe he gambled wrong. I'm not for or against Harper in this regard. I think the whole thing is mind-blowingly complicated, and no issue within the TPP can be seen in isolation.
Or we'd be the assholes if we didn't sign on with it. Take your pick
As an European, can someone explain what all this TPP upset is about?
Done 

Greeting from Ontario 
So if Canada says no and everyone else says yes, it still passes, Canada is just left out, yes?

Or, to put it another way, Canada can only save themselves, not those of us living in the basement (USA)?

Dear Canada, please let me immigrate. :(
As an American I feel like I got the best out of this deal that was personally negotiated by our leaders. 
The most faulty thing the Harper government has done was the Bill C51.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUTnNKhF-EU

pretty much every country in the TPP right now.
What does this have to do with Metal Gear Solid?
Yeah, and Justin Trudeau's party have shown themselves to be of a very similar mindset. Why didn't people go NDP? At least they were different.
He would know, he was an expert in bad decision making.
Harper might have set the ground-work but wasn't Trudeau and Mulcair both on board for this? It was probably the only thing all three parties actually agreed on. Could be wrong though, my Google-Fu is weak this morning.
To be fair, Harper wasn't exactly the driving force on this one.  Not that he wouldn't excitedly sign any agreement that fucks poor Canadians over in favour of rich foreigners, but he didn't write the TPP personally.  
In other news today: The sun doesn't revolve around earth as was previously reported.
But Canada gets [the beef](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/11/06/455055023/episode-662-omg-tpp)?
First of all those 3 letters are banned on reddit...... 
Don't worry, we'll get shafted by this, too.
When as a politician ever done anything good for "the people" ? 
I just came into this thread to see how Canadians rage.  Politely, is the answer to that question.
Not one real specific in this article.  just saying.
Crying about free trade is silly.  Same sorta fear mongering happened with NAFTA.  So 2 percent of our dairy market will be opened to outsiders.  Big whoop.
What would happen if one of the TPP countrys, for example Canada, decided to ignore the treaty? 
Completely off topic, just a case of lysdexia here, but I had to re-read the headline twice.  I thought it said, "TPP deal 'worst thing that Harper government has done for Canada':  Ballistae
From:

I would like professional lawyers / people with reputable legal knowledge to annotate the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) on genius.com

&gt;I copied and pasted the chapters 0 to 30 of the TPP from http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Treaties-and-International-Law/01-Treaties-for-which-NZ-is-Depositary/0-Trans-Pacific-Partnership-Text.php to: http://genius.com/albums/Transpacific-partnership-tpp-negotiating-parties/Trans-pacific-partnership

&gt; I still have the annexes of chapter 2, 12, and 15 left to do         &gt; because I hit an album limit on genius.com (I used the "Contact Us" link on their website for help with that), but the rest is complete. I am about to start reformatting the text to be easier &gt; on the eyes since copying from a PDF into a text box strips out  &gt; all the formatting and blank lines.  Where should I go? r/lawyers is a private subreddit. Are there any lawyers reading on r/eli5? Many thanks
I am outraged. Let us all be outraged by this.
Trudeau is a fraud if he passes it, and I have a sneaking suspicion he will.
I read that as Ball Is Life
I'm glad you Canadians are actually having a debate about the TPP and the treaty became an election issue. Here in Australia we're going to pass it simply because big old buddy America told us to.
Come on reddit, I know for a fact 80% of you don't even know what the TPP deal is about, you just echo chamber that you heard someone else say it was bad.
[deleted]
The people aren't the ones doing the negotiating, but that doesn't mean their thoughts and opinions don't matter. They might not have a global perspective of all the issues, but they do have vested interests. 

And while not every citizen will be well-informed, what about those who are? Seemed to be that only the biggest political donors had a spot at the negotiating table (or at least access to the negotiators). If you ask me, granting corporations access to the negotiations while keeping it completely secret from the rest of the world until it's too late to change anything is wrong. 
How long will Trudeau examine TPP before grudgingly signing on?
Balsillie is also the one who drove RIM/Blackberry into the ground because he didn't innovate or plan for the future. 
Balsillie's worst thing was getting Hamilton to think they were getting an NHL team.
What does the agreement do? Invest everything in RIM?
Jim Balsillie is awesome.  I know a few small start-ups that reached out to him and he had no problems jumping on a call with them and giving them great advice.

Also, what he said is VERY important.  Intellectual Property is his core competency.
What about the second class citizen thing?
That guy knows business!
But hey, now Truedoh is in, you can now repeal it right?

Harper was only happy when he was parceling out Canada and selling it off to the highest bidder.  Like Mulroney.
Good thing it's being repealed 
Dear Diary,

Gosh, I'm super excited that the american political geniuses of /r/worldnews have decided to become interested in Canadian politics!

/s

How do you remove a sub from /r/all again?
Can we get a statement from someone who *didn't* run his company into the ground by completely failing to compete?

Yes, more protectionism might have saved RIM. But is that really the best outcome? Competition is what made the smartphone better, would you rather it just stayed with what RIM imagined forever?
Apparently none of you have any idea what the Asian counterfeit market is like. I worked in the semiconductor field for 10 years specifically combatting counterfeit components that could be used in medical devices etc.. And they don't give a fuck about a copyright or anything else for that matter, they just want a quick payment for fake non working parts. The us's system needs to be at the forefront of this deal because frankly other countries laws are a joke.
&gt; Globalnews.ca

The most renowned conspiracy theorist pseudo-science website on the internet?

wow, it must be true then.
This kind of alarmism is why we have an impossible time trusting our media.
&gt; has done ~~for~~ **to** Canada

FTFY.
Harper and his goons did many horrible things, including much about the TTP, but it's up to J-trude to actually man up to stopping it.

So far, he made a Minister of Science, renamed the M.of Environment to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and replaced a total jackoff old-white-guy-in-suit with a badass guy with real experience as Minister of Defense, he has a cabinet with almost exactly 50/50 men and women, and half of them didn't even use a religious oath while swearing in!

So far, he has done a lot more than I expected, but it's too early to tell.
Is it possible that the TPP is literally the worst thing for *every* country involved?
[deleted]
I'm Canadian and I absolutely cannot even begin to describe how relieved the majority of intelligent Canadians were once Harper lost our recent election. 

We were fucking TERRIFIED of the possibility of him being prime minister for another 4 years even though he was already in power for 10 years. Even the U.S.A. doesn't allow their presidents to remain in office for more than 10 years and we all know that our loveable, yet odd brother America is ALL kinds of fucked up in many ways.

Even progressive conservatives (the ones who actually used their fucking brains) realized how insanely evil and corrupt Stephen Harper was and still is.

Stephen Harper was far and away Canada's WORST prime minister. He proudly claimed that he was an economist and that that is the main reason we should keep him as our leader.

Well guess what? Our economy got so out of control and bad that when election time rolled around, our dollar was worth a pathetic 77 fucking cents. His much too heavy reliance on the oil industry and not diversifying our economy helped ruin things more and more. 

And he even muzzled all our scientists and destroyed historic scientific documents which was VERY scary. Did I also mention how much he fucked up our insanely beautiful environment?

He even tried to claim that marijuana was infinitely more dangerous than alcohol/tobacco which was completely laughable. Every single scientific study that wasn't bought off by big pharma companies 100% disproved this.

The funniest part of our recent election is when Harper became so scared and desperate that he partnered up with Rob Ford who is one of the most infamous crack smoking, rascist, alcoholic fucks to ever be mayor in Canada.

I laughed so hard the day I found out he partnered with Rob Ford because I knew right then and there that that cunt was finished.
[deleted]
The world is against the TPP, yet the governments roll on. Who are they representing anyway?
Write your MP and urge them to pull out of this corporate takeover! 
harper and the conservatives get a lot of flack but do you remember what party flat out lied on a major issue after being elected?

thats right, the liberal party.

remember "I wont raise taxes, but I wont lower them either" dalton mcguinty?  yeah.  lets hope justin isn't as eager to go back on election promises.

besides, if it does pass it's a failure on all parties, be it conservative, liberal, or ndp, for not being vocal against it.
Not one leader will lift a finger to stop it in any country..no matter what they say. Your hero that wanna be Stalin piece of Shit Bernie Sanders, yeah fuck you I said it, will talk all kinds of Shit against it and not do a single fucking thing about it. 
Crashing this country

WITH NO SURVIVORS
Is there anyone in the western hemisphere who is actually in favor of this?
Honestly we're screwed either way, we need to sign it to stay relevant and maintain our export based economy but, if we do sign it we may end up losing a lot anyways. 
that is a really naive summary of what harper did to canada
That wooden stump that replaced him wasn't the leader of every other country's leader, he has given.
fuckin' eh on that headline!

ball silly lol
This shouldn't be a big surprise, since when has any free trade agreement entered into by Canada done much good for it's citizens.
I liked the part where he actually explained what was wrong with it instead of repeating "American copyright laws". If you compare American and Canadian economies, their doesn't seem so dysfunctional, especially when you look at the culture of innovation there as compared to here, or anywhere else in the world.
All this hand-wringing is just costing us previous time. The best course of action is for all nations to sign the agreement, and we have can have a polite debate about it afterwards.
I'm 1000th comment here.
he said rather ballsilly
Is Balsillie his name or is it the way in which he called out the TTP?
This is why they elected the one true Lord to heal the oceans and stop world hunger. He is a progressive, thus, he is a God. 

This hero worship is sad. But, small minds are easily impressed upon.
Worst thing Obama can do for Americans. But hey, when has the US Govt ever had the American people's best interest to consider? It's always corporations first.  The people are simply the "workers."
In order to keep China in bay, US and Canada government will have to make some scarifies.
He must've gotten millions upon millions in bribes, seeing as how he knew that he didn't stand a chance of being re-elected, yet worked to pass this bullshit piece of legislation before leaving office, leaving it as his legacy.
This is the worst thing in Canada, and therefore the world. 
Yeah, Stephen Harper was almost as bad as Pierre Trudeau.
making Canada a vassal of israel in pursuit of neocon wars and spending Canada's blood and treasure for israel's regional superpower goals isn't worse?
Harper took 20 blue pills to throw those last few fucks into us

I see Metacanada is leaking again....  this is a conservative mess that has been handed to the Liberals, stop acting like cunts.
So Canadians don't want to play by the same rules like everybody else. Hmmmm
I hope the Liberals are listening!
I'm sorry but anyone associated with the failure that is RIM probably shouldn't be saying much about international trade as the lack of that is what killed RIM.
No offence but this article was super vague on why the TPP is bad and the majority of opinion didn't even come from an economist.

Its ridiculous this is even published as a news
Really, we are going to listen to the man who spent more time trying to bring a hockey team to Toronto instead of focusing on 'competition' that eventually killed off RIM?  
Also, what's the point of "Canadian Innovation" if there's no market for it in Canada.  My experience shows that most Canadian innovators end up taking their products to the US because it's a bigger market that supports innovation (it's less risk averse than Canada) so we're not getting any benefit anyways.  In fact we are losing our innovators and the revenue to the US already.
It makes sense to review the 'provisions' and make sure they are favorable for both countries, but from a negotiation standpoint tell me what leverage do we have against the US or the EU for that matter?  We are an economy of 33 million people that is dependent on commodities and manufacturing (as a result of FX); which if you have not noticed recently are nose diving (e.g. keystone).  If we want to shift from a cost economy to a differentiator we have no choice but to innovate; and anything we can do to boost innovation in this country is an improvement from where we currently are.  
who cares

so long as canada hugs america, and has the american army to protect them, and america to be their main trade partner, theyll be fine

even if some canadians wish they were france
Relax.  Tim Hortons will still be open.
My roommate said yesterday, "ISIS should ask the Nazis how it went the last time someone gave the US and Russia a reason to put aside their 10,000 differences."
The next couple weeks are going to be interesting.
Fighting terrorism needs to be a global effort. I sincerely hope a league of western nations wipes ISIS off the face of the earth.
""This tragedy has become another testimony of terrorism's barbarity, which poses a challenge to human civilisation," Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to French counterpart Francois Hollande, according to the Kremlin."

He said in a TELEGRAM? 
The west needs to stop the love making to the Saud dynasty and acknowledge a secular Syrian government. 
HAHA. Remember [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/qdCuOIk.jpg) ?   Let's pretend that everybody's out there to save the world from evil.   
NATO should definitely answer the call. An attack against one nation of NATO is an attack against us all. Every country under the treaty should do it's part to eradicate this disease from the earth not just France and not just the USA.
And we know that Russia does not fuck around...

"The incident began when four Soviet diplomats were kidnaped last September by Muslim extremists who demanded that Moscow pressure the Syrian government to stop pro-Syrian militiamen from shelling rival Muslim positions in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli.

The militiamen, the Jerusalem paper said, did not cease their attacks, and the body of one of the Soviet diplomats, Arkady Katkov, was found a few days later in a field in Beirut.

The KGB then apparently kidnaped and killed a relative of an unnamed leader of the Shias' Hezbollah (Party of God) group, a radical, pro-Iranian group that has been suspected of various terrorist activities against Western targets in Lebanon.

Parts of the man's body, the paper said, were then sent to the Hezbollah leader with a warning that he would lose other relatives in a similar fashion if the three remaining Soviet diplomats were not immediately released. They were quickly freed.

The newspaper quoted "observers in Jerusalem" as saying: "This is the way the Soviets operate. They do things--they don't talk. And this is the language Hezbollah understands.""

Real life rainbow six?
BRITAIN. USA. FRANCE. RUSSIA. THE ORIGINAL FAB FOUR. WINNERS OF WW2.

WE'RE GETTING THE BAND BACK TOGETHER BOYS!

EDIT: Listen, I get people are angry I left out a lot of the other countries who helped out during the war, and I'm sorry. In school, we were always taught that the biggest fighters in WW2 were BARF (Britain, America, Russia, France) vs JIG (Japan, Italy, Germany). That's the way I've always thought of it and I figured that was the easiest way to say it. I'm sorry if I pissed off anyone for excluding their country. I recognize and appreciate everything that everyone contributed to the war effort.
Why is terrorism in quotes?
ITT: people who were calling the US warmongers last week want the US to wage war.
Someone is arming them.  Go after that, even if it means the Saudis.
Your either going to need brutal regimes like Saadams Iraq to keep them in check or a constant presence of outside militaries plus some sort of rebuilding effort. That region is failed and the world needs to police and rebuild it. Bombs won't stop the problem.
I've been saying for a year or more that ISIS might be that "Alien Invasion" that unites the world. 
The civilized world needs to unite against this barbarism. Nothing can unite people as much as having a common enemy, and ISIS seems like just the ticket. 

We always hear how our actions serve as recruitment for terrorists.  Maybe it's time to reverse that.  Let their heinous acts serve to unite us, letting go of lesser quarrels (at least temporarily) in order to confront this threat and end it. 

I'm not sure that it is something that can be won, but surely it every nation on earth joins forces we can get fairly close. 
Look, ISIS is essentially a government and while it's bad that they have taken over such a big area, the good thing is you can wage traditional war against a government. Let's get Russia, and the U.S. and France and Germany and Britain and just wipe ISIS off the map.
*and rebuild the countries so that terrorism does not thrive. 
https://media.giphy.com/media/3o85xH3Se9dX6eZSb6/giphy.gif
&gt;Don't forget: fighting terrorism starts at home. Now, everyone give up those pesky freedoms so we can keep you safe.  
  
I sincerely hope it doesn't turn out that way, but we're creatures of habit.
Meanwhile in the Middle East... ISIS members spread their butt cheeks to prepare for Putin's arrival. 
If the US says no to this, I'm so fucking done. 
4 years and 7 months ago, the people of the west deemed Assad the epitome of evil, disregarding the pragmatic approach that one solution is not universal to every ambiance and historical circumstance.
The rule of the idiom "one thing leads to another" does not stop existing in the moment we initiate an action.
I would gladly help defeating ISIS and terrorism if i could, at any cost. It is time to set the limit, that in my opinion is way under where we are now! The world can't let this kind of actions happen time after time. Is the world bigger than ISIS, isn't it? May the world come together as one against terrorism and stop it!
There's this weird thing I feel about ISIS. Everyone hating them could seriously bring unity in the Middle East. 
I hope Obama stops this dick size contest with Putin over getting rid of Assad. We have done nothing meaningful to deal with ISIS because we can't agree with the Russians over the future of Syria. Give the Kurds the weapons they need, and screw Turkey if they don't like.
Justice League confirmed
When can we label the terrorists Nod and everyone else GDI?
Why are there quotation marks in the headline?
I find this heartening, we need to work with Russia on this, 100%.
I feel like this whole thing is a global ploy to erode rights
I wonder if people will ever realize that trying to wipe out ISIS isn't gonna work out like they think

Seems like fawning over some fantasy is looked up to in this thread
I hope young people in Europe and the United States understand that we are at war. 
When even Putin says calls out for anti-terrorism, you know its just THAT bad.
If the West can't eliminate ISIS, (at least) support Putin. 
Until and unless we identify the threat as fundamentalist, political Islam, this will only get worse.  Shows of unity mean nothing if you make no changes.  


ISIS isn't the only problem.  Most of the terrorists were European by nationality.  We had a massacre in Paris earlier this year where ISIS wasn't so involved.  Let's address that fact, shall we?
Guys, this is *Putin* calling for unity. Shit's real. We don't get to sit around anymore.

Someone tell them to start up that land war with Russia they were planning on last year. Winter is coming, after all.
Obama needs to grow a pair and actually send troops to attack Isis. The simple bombing is not containing them as he said yesterday. 
https://i.imgur.com/317e4xW.jpg
isis will now be waswas.
This deeply analytic article puts paid to a great deal of what is being said here:

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980

It's a long read but it is well worth it and something we all need to understand.  This event fits perfectly into the analysis and thesis of the article.  What's weird is that I read the article just a couple of hours before the Paris event began to unfold and saw the whole thing through that lens through which it was inevitable and reasonable (within a very warped but very tight causality system.)

The thing we all need to really understand is what they expect to come from it and such future efforts.
Do people really believe that you can stop terrorism by bombing the shit out of them? Each civilian accidentally killed in the fight against terrorism will encourage a gullible child or teenager in the area to join the terrorist. That area of the world needs education and opportunities for youth besides bombs dropping on their heads. Otherwise the cycle repeats over and over.
Putin is full of shit. When France uses the article in the NATO treaty to get all of us involved in Syria, they're going to drag feet because it means removing Assad from power. With a puppet government in office the US and Europe want to build a pipeline that'll allow Europe to not be dependant on Russian oil. Russia desperately needs oil revenue because its economy is pure shit. It's the sole reason why the west have been backing the rebels over Assad and ISIS.
He's used 'terrorist attacks' as an excuse to go to war before. There's evidence that he bombed apartment buildings and said the Chechens did it so he could go to war with Chechnya, in order to bypass his presidential term limits. The bombs were proven to be from the Russian military, which means Putin had to have known about them. The point I'm trying to make is that when Putin says he's fighting terrorism there is definitely an ulterior motive.
Like terrorism in Eastern Ukraine? 
He could start by ceasing to sponsor terrorists in Eastern Ukraine.
Good luck with that Russia- it worked awesome for the US.
I am not gonna lie, the thought of the US banding together with Russia to fight terrorism excites me. It almost feels like two rival superheroes banding together to destroy an evil. 

Then again, I am kind of a moron and am probably missing some big repercussions here.
More war... Yay
Putin should start, you know, bombing ISIS.

He's been too busy bombing Assad's opposition instead.
Stop bombing the rebels who oppose IS then you fucktard (Vlad) and show some unit maaaate!  
ITT: People that honestly believe that military intervention is anything other than a short-term solution to a long-term problem. How many times do we have to fuck the Middle East up before we realise that essentially all that does is encourage the extremism we set out to eradicate. 
The war against terrorism is stupid, we need to declare war on isis or heaven sake what is the rest of the middle east doing to crush isis other than squabbling.  It seems that the Kurds/Iranians are only ones doing something.
Do you want Rainbow Six? Because this is how you get Rainbow Six. 
Was there not unity in fighting terrorism before this?
I just watched spectre and this seems all too like it. 
Look, ISIS are evil and I agree that everyone on the planet should unite against them. But let's not be too quick to praise Russia (or any country except Switzerland) as the bastion of peace less than a year after they helped to commit multitudes of human rights violations and war crimes in the Ukraine...
Attacking ISIS is really a proxy war around Syria and Iran so don't take this without a grain of salt 
Doesn't Russia want some super-battle ships from France? I wonder if this will bridge the gap between the two nations and *'force'* France to hand them over.

I agree with Putin, the world should unite to crush Isis and all radical Islam. But Putin just strikes me as such a sinister dude that having his aid feels dirty or disguised. I know one cannot hold such sentiment in the wake of violence Isis creates but IDK, thinking long-term geopolitical relations here. It's not like we are going to forget about the invasion of Ukraine or internal fathoms Russia has.
I guess the problem here is in the definition of "terrorist".
So, whatever happened to the crashed russian airplane. was it related at all?
Isis is doing a bang up job of trying to destroy themselves.
I understand I may not be educated in the field and it would likely have massive repercussions for years to come, but nothing would satisfy my more than seeing the combined might of the allied forces and the red army leave Syria a smoldering husk of ash and dirt. 
We already dicked around in that region Russia do us a solid and take care of this for us.
did putin forget crimea?
So down to work with Russia to fuck over these scumbags. We may clash often, but when we fuse it's like Gogeta from DBZ. Take 2 juggernaughts and combine them... you're gonna get absolutely decimated.

Let's do this shit.
Putin loves Fallout 4
lol. Putin is a huge terrorist. What a dickhole. 
What if we "bombed" the middle east with mass amounts of marijuana smoke and then everyone there got so baked they put down their guns and shared meals with each other and pondered the question of why we're bothering with this mess? 

Voila. 
I trust Putin more to do something than our local sack of cowering corrupt shit called Obama. 
So .. France will now join Iran and Russia in supporting Assad in Syria? 
If everyone is against ISIS, who the fuck is arming the ISIS?
We're all basically starring in "Spectre" now. And "Spectre" sucked.
Putin knows. This is coming from a country that most likely suffered a terrorist attack just last week. 
Terrorism is the most broad fucking word and is quickly becoming meaningless, i really have no idea who he's talking about? Millions of citizens being scanned as terrorists? Specific organizations being labeled as terrorists? Individual actions and gunman blamed as terrorists? Which is it? Who are you fighting? Everyone?
Putin his foot down.  
This was a gift for Putin. He desperately needed something to distract the world from his imperial ambitions, so he decided to to get involved in Syria, which had the side benefit of protecting his only base on the Mediterranean. 

Then, this whole diversion blew up in a much, much bigger than he had planned. I'd say things are going swimmingly for him right now as the rest of the world is totally distracted from what he's really trying to accomplish behind the scenes. Bombed airliner be damned, if you have to crack a few eggs to conquer the world, so be it.
Putin is using this as an excuse to make it seem like "Russia is the savior of the world against those who try to destroy civilization." He is doing this just like with Georgia and Ukraine to try to make a name for himself and the Russian nation.
I am with Putin
Everyone in this thread is commenting like Putin is some hero... Man is a thug and a crook and is not to be trusted on any level whatsoever
Sadly, Putin is the leader we need
what the world really needs is unity against Islam. Stop trying to pretend that not all terrorists are Muslim. Islam is the main driving force behind modern terrorism. And while it used to be a decent religion, it has been corrupted beyond recovery. Islam needs to be abandoned and forgotten.
Don't believe anything that Putin says. Also, what happened to him "doing what Obama couldn't and destroying ISIS in two days?"
Dear Russia,

We're in.

Sincerely, the USA.
I'll believe Putin when the terrorists that shot down MH17 are brought to justice.
As if the likes of USA would stop funding 'rebel's' in the likes of Syria though. Unity won't happen unfortunately.

Instead, it's a proxy war vs Russia.
Putin can call for unity all he wants, but the truth is majority of the world leaders won't put aside their political agendas to unite against ISIS.
It's a strange day when Vladimir Putin says something I completely agree with.
""This tragedy has become another testimony of terrorism's barbarity, which poses a challenge to human civilisation," Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram to French counterpart Francois Hollande, according to the Kremlin."

He said in a TELEGRAM? 
Poking and proding at Putin is not advisable. The Russian people are itching for a fight, a real mass scale one, it's as if they have to get it out of their system. Putin is pressured heavily from his right to fuck up anything. Additionally unlike America the Russian military isn't as, well let's say well behaved. Russia will have no qualms about burning all of Syria and Iraq to the ground and salting all it's fields figuratively speaking. A Russian flag will rise over these lands and wont come down but unlike America Russia wont feel burdened by the self imposed task of rebuilding these places. Putin doesn't care - it's about influence and perception. He'd "burn the world down to be king of the ashes", Russians feel like they have unfinished business in the muslim world.
I have to agree with him. We should all just man up and unite to end this world wide parasite. Tell everyone else to deal, if we keep playing the politics game it just gives these groups the upper hand.
remember that time putin shot down an airliner full of innocent people?
The US is too sluggish and divided to do anything useful against ISIS. Russia however has a powerful conventional military and no qualms about using them in ethically ambiguous ways. I hope the Russians and French join up and wage total war against these hajis. Destroy everything. 
Say what you want about Putin, Russia knows first hand about Islamic terrorism.  I'd say the biggest difference between them and the west is culturally, they match the brutality in response.
It's sad when a guy like Putin is rallying people. 
Terrorism is an idea. You can't fight an idea with violence. That will only make it easier for the recruiters of the likes of ISIS to brainwash new recruits 'look at how bad they are they come in here and bomb us, they're godless and need to be wiped out' 

The only way to combat an idea is education. 
Too bad George Fucking W. Bush didn't say this, instead of starting two fucking stupid wars.

/We're going to pay for the stupidity of Bush/Cheney for the next 100 years.
That's great but what about you basically invading Ukraine?
As in destroy Islam, yeah I'm all for it.
Putin calling out for unity, that's just laughable
Putin is full of it. Most of his military attacks were against non-terrorist rebels who didn't want to be oppressed by Asad. He barely touched ISIS. 
Maybe Putin should GTFO of Ukraine first before he makes calls for unity.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but Putin and Russia are pretty much the only world leader we have at the moment that has an actual spine.  I mean Russia is by no means perfect, but you know Russia isn't afraid to get dirty and can tough it out.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toAEQTsidvg
How about they stop condemning them and do something about it. Given how moods are shifting i wouldn't be surprised to see muslim purges in a couple of years. Well not my problem, i'm not muslim if that happens i won't even be able to criticize people who will do those purges, rather i'll criticize incompetence of current governments who didn't do shit and muslim leaders who didn't care.
*and rebuild the countries so that terrorism does not thrive. 
Whether or not this is posturing I'm not sure, but it would be a monumental accomplishment if the Paris attacks helped turn what seems like a looming proxy war in Syria into a cooperative coalition.
Can we make race out of it like the race for Berlin? The winner can take the land it conquered during the raid
Can't throw him, but its good to hear Putin say this. 

Putin and France's far right have been in bed for a long time. Frances far right has the most to gain from these attacks. Coincidence? 
NWO 
Why is terrorism in quotes?
If I was ISIS I'd know my end is near.

A) I attack any other Western location and US, UK, China, Russia and France (if not more e.g. Germany, Italy...) will come after me

B) I no longer attack outside of Syria and see my power dwindle...
Yes lets start with getting every Syrian male of fighting age that has come to Europe fleeing Isis, trained and returned to fight alongside the troops that are willing to put there lives at risk for them.
Damn I never thought I see the day I agree with Putin on anything...
Yes! We're all in this together- we're all human. These people are not any longer. That's the difference between us and them. We all have to stand together, not as individual countries. As friends with a common goal.
By the way, let's also call for unity against obstruction of the press and corrupt government!
Why is 'terrorism' in quotes here?  This was, by definition, terrorism.
* welcome to 2001, earth
Believe in music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdQHZtEZAkE
Wait... Telegrams are still a thing?!
Why is terrorism in quotes?
The enemy of my enemy is my friend...  What's up Russia, you bestest buddy you? Time to rekindle our relationship.
Of course he does.  He wants to be able to clamp down on seperatist movements that attempt to break away from Rusia.  Add in the ability to rig a few key votes and no territory will ever be able to break away again.
Soooo WW3 is official then?
Welp, looks like its time for WWIII
"said in a telegram"

Huh, people still use these?
Yes, let's declare war against an idea.  That's a wonderful idea.  That has *never* failed before.

The US should stay the fuck out of this.  Let Russia deal with it, they're close enough that it would affect them.
Time to kick ass
There are a lot of people on here suggesting military action, which I don't disagree with. How many do you think would be willing to put their lives on the line when the rubber meets the road. 
The only long term answer to religious terrorism is influencing secular education reform in the Middle East and usuring in a new enlightenment, this time for Islam as opposed to the secular moral enlightenment Christianity went through in the 1700's
 "Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a telegram"
...but why?
Have to ask why they attacked...pretty easy to see for anyone with half a brain.
When Putin is calling for unity with the West over something you've done, you know you've fucked up. 

We should just all meet ISIS in their territory at that town they want to have the apocalypse at (sorry I can't remember the name) and fight them on the ground. 

With all the tech our nations have the civilian casualties caused by us would be limited. 

The follow up would have to be years of helping to essentially set up civilization in the Middle East, ousting any other radical elements and bring Islam as a whole into the 21st century. Which can't be done by alienating Islam as it just encourages an "us vs. them" mentality. 

 (Disclaimer: This is not to say that there aren't already Muslims who happily co-exist with us in Western society, because I'd be a liar if I were to say otherwise)  

 For a start we could stop funding the Saudi's who in turn fund these radical groups. I can't really see any other way of doing it. 

War won't fix the problem permanently. It'd be one of the greatest moments in human history. 

To begin with we could all stop arguing with ourselves, realise that there is a problem and just get the fuck on with it.  

If we were to somehow fix the most of the problems in Middle East so that the countries there were capable of providing a relatively safe environment for people to flourish I guarantee we wouldn't be facing as big a migrant crisis as we are now. Sending immigrants back won't change much. 

Some people might ask why it is on us to "fix" the Middle East, well because at the end of it all we are all affected by the problems out there, as the attacks on Paris and other Western countries have shown us. 

We just need to care more. 

Sorry for the rant but like everyone else I feel helpless right now as another civilian who doesn't have enough money or political clout to make much change on my own. 

I'm tired of all the hatred.

"And the armies of Rome shall unite" 


Starting to think the Quran may be prophecy 
You know, I've just had a funny thought...

ISIS is doing all of this because they want their safe space.
So, just like Watchmen?
Not so fast, Mr. Putin. Read what Sean's insightful analysis says first and allow time for the French to reflect on their doings against Muslim minorities before jumping into conclusion. 
[Sean R. Roberts, special to CNN: "Paris shooting: terrorism or cry of desperation?"](http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/opinion/china-tiananmen-uyghurs/)
I say yes. Let's Grozny the mideast together and put the Cold War behind us.  A Russia-NATO alliance would be an unstoppable juggernaut. 
Can the good people in this world put aside our political quarrels and stand united in the effort to rid this world from these kinds of people? Terrorism is not a religion and true followers of a true God are not terrorists. Radical Islam doesn't have a particular country it's a disease that's affecting many countries and is harming many good people. It's a disease that needs to be eradicated from the planet and everyone needs to unify against it, not just America or Russia, or France. Everyone. Including the citizens of the cities and towns where this evil rests and eats. Calling this an act of war is like calling water wet, of course it is. These people have declared war against us long ago, when will we respond with our own declaration? 
I'm not sure how to take this. Now there'll be a set label for terrorists, afterwards which may/not include perimeters for civilian suspects. Was it a bad thing that happened? Yes. Will things be set to "ensure" that this won't happen again? Very probably. Can those items be used as surveillance and gather information for persecution of those with "unfavorable thoughts"? Unknown, but the TPP is suppose to be a good thing for some.
Yeah we need to stop Putin' this off, and Obama the hell out of them. ...Puns.
So when does it count as a world war?
How about a new Olympic sport:

"Who can kill most terrorists?"

Except we start now and hope to erase all of them by the end of the week...
They communicate by telegram
This strategy of arming "moderate" rebels is bullshit. US should join Russia and bomb Nusra, ISIS and all the other factions. Al-Assad is the lesser evil. 
150 people are killed in Paris and we should unify but when he shoots down a passenger plane and the same amount of people are killed we should mind our own business. 
Is it a terrible idea to let the middle eats sort their shit out with no interference, not letting anyone in to avoid more terrorist attacks?  I think they were a bit better with dictators than so called democracy, I really don't know much about the subject and would love someone to tell me why this is wrong. 
Now you fucked up
This all feels so familiar...
This has a whole the "enemy of my enemy..." type of feeling. 
Ok Putin, but explain MH17.
LETS DO IT 

TIME TO THROW DOWN
Why does Putin use the telegram? I've heard him using it before for foreign correspondence as well.
why this mouse    so loud ?

http://imgur.com/JcUQLTx
In order to combat terrorism he immediately had an anti-corruption journalist killed.
Huh, I feel a sudden urge not to be united against terrorism.
I think that this extends across all nations most of all the islamic nations. 
I wonder if "unity" in the Russian sense means "get all those fuckers behind the French Attacks, unified in a grid coordinate, and Russia has the cure".....
Thanks everyone for showing support. I cant go anywhere online without seeing the american red, white, and blue. Thx world

That's rich coming from him, where do you think ISIS gets their weapons from?, on one hand he's selling arms to who ever is buying them and then he's trying to sympathize with the west, fuck Putin.
I like how Putin keeps a clear head even after such horrible events. He calls for unity against terrorism - not for WAR. He doesn't present a clear target for everyone to follow up on and leaves it open for people to start thinking. He offers close cooperation in the INVESTIGATION of the attacks - not dubious revenge operations. He knows that the problem is deeper than the IS, but he is clever enough to let the world draw it's on conclusions, merely hinting at things. Damn, this guy is such an intelligent man and brilliant strategist. If there is someone to sort out the mess that the world currently is - it's certainly Wladimir Putin.
Putin initiated a campaign in Syria in order to distract the world from his failed misadventures in Ukraine and rally his own population into patriotic fervor so they would pay less attention to the collapsing economy. He never intended to fight ISIS; his goal is and will be the support of his long-standing ally, the Assad regime, and so the Russian attacks have been primarily concentrated on rebel groups opposed to both Assad and the Islamic State. This was met with significant criticism, so in order to demonstrate good will, his forces had to make a few heavily publicized strikes against ISIS. Unfortunately, ISIS was quick to retaliate.

Putin is rapidly getting dragged into a Shiite-Sunni war of biblical (Quranic?) proportions while also having to deal with failing economy and rising opposition back home. No wonder, really: Russians not yet brainwashed by the infamous state media are getting fed up with rampant corruption, crackdowns on businesses refusing to play by the rules of The Kremlin Family, jailings and murders of prominent opposition activists, and the economy's complete and utter dependence on oil exports, a commodity whose age is about to end.

This isn't like supporting Stalin against Hitler. Stalin was a genocidal tyrant with a vision. He sought to establish a new prosperous order. Putin is a crook with no aspirations besides seizing wealth and holding it. He is not terribly good at this either, and his televised "104% supporters" would drop the act in an instant as soon as someone actually manages to stand up against the system. As long as Putin is in charge, Russia will never be the embodiment of the classical fantasy trope - the "Familiar friendly enemy" with which the West could unite against a greater threat.
Good guy Isis 

Uniting the world 
Leave French,Saudi,Turkish and US governments out of it.They cannot fight the same terrorists who supported themselves not long ago.
Next up: Kim Jong-Un calls for unity against Lettuce.
The U.S, Russia and China are all down to wipe out ISIS now. ISIS done fucked up 
Unity against Russian terrorism? It's no nice he wants us to unite against him. But we already are, no?
Now here's someone who can talk about actually doing something against Isis unlike the US that just bombs hospitals..
Great idea. Let's start with Ukraine. #Endtheterrorists &lt;/sarcasim&gt;  
its amazing that 15 years after 9/11 and all we been through mulder says it best from the new xfiles trailer (though nothing to do with aliens of course but..) "they police us, and spy on us, telling us it wil make us safer, you've never been in more danger" :-(.
What a strange world it is; just a few weeks and months ago, we were fighting with Russia over taking the Crimea and sending troops into eastern Ukraine.  Now we're considering joining forces against another foe which threatens everybody.  It's not the right thing to say, but I wish all the strength and violence and the well-founded fear of Russia on ISIS right now.  Vader syndrome at its best.
  I'm always feeling bad for the Kurds through all this. I feel like they are the most tolerant group over there, and the Turks just keep shitting on them. It seems like Turkey would even try Genocide on them if the U.N would allow it. Definitely seems like the U.S would allow it, seeing as though we need Turkey. And would rather send weapons to so called "moderate" rebels instead of them.
Screw you putin go back to russia and quit annexing territory like hitler. 
Hey Putin, remember when your dudes blew up a plane full of civilians as part of your campaign to take over bits of Ukraine?

I mean, nice sentiment, but damn.
Time to go to work.  US, Russia, and France team up again to rid the world of scum.
putins always got such good advice
I can see like all the countries discussing strategy. Then you just have russia go LEROOOOY JEEEENKINS all in there. Like a political cartoon 
How do you fight something that can blend in with civilians easily?

It is sad that to act as humanity, to fight for Earth, we need a common enemy.


My allegiance already belongs to Earth and all her future colonies, and this article gives me hope that eventually humanity will grow up, set aside borders and categories, and understand that the incredibly rare, small and beautiful part of the universe we live in deserves better.
Could they retract the comment about Kerry by saying "he does *not* have the mental abilities of a 12-year-old"?

edit: smelling mistake
Just nominate Mel Gibson as ambassador to Israel and call it even.
Lol. and yet, somehow, they asked for an extra 5 billion this year, we need to stop sending these people tax dollars, we need to fix American infrastructure not Israel's.


I don't get it - has the Israeli leadership just decided to be as bananas as possible? I get that they're under a lot of pressure, all the time, but... still.
I dont understand why the Israelis are trying to isolate themselves so much on the world stage. the US was one of the last backers of the country, as Europe and most of the western world had already said they had gone too far in many aspects.

Seems Netanyahu's plan is to back the Republican party 100%, and hope they get back into power, otherwise they are just going to marginalize themselves further
"As head of public diplomacy and media, Baratz, a 42-year-old philosophy lecturer, will be tasked with improving Israel's reputation in the world."

Off to a GREAT start...
Last year the US gave Netanyahu's government **3 billion dollars** in foreign aid. Israel has universal health care and cheap university tuition. How about we cut them off the gravy train?
I love how the Israeli governments definition of anti-Semitism is "you disagreed with something we said or did"...
[Israel receives more foreign aid than any other country. Would be a pitty if they'd lose the support of USA.](http://chrisblattman.com/files/2015/10/USaidmoneyHowMuch.jpg)
Its like "fuck you; now give me more military aid pls"
Time to take our toys and go home. They don't want to play with us anymore.
As an American citizen, I do not understand why America gives a crap about Israel.  Someone, ELI5 please.
Fuck em. Can we have our money back now?
This is actually a pretty deft move by Netanyahu.

He's basically telling the Arabs: "Look, try and understand something, even when we shit all over these idiots, we still get them to give us whatever we want afterwards."
Israel responds by saying you insult us by your offense at our insults, now give us five billion dollars a year for the next ten years instead of  instead of three
Biting the hand that feeds.
Kerry was overheard remarking "This is why nobody in the middle east likes you, you should kill yourself"
Bibi also recently blamed Palestine for the holocaust . He has a rather ... unique (detached from reality) perspective  
Why are we allied with Israel?

They are a constant problem.



I'd love to hear his evidence for Obama's anti-semitism. 
Israel have been losing touch with proper diplomacy and the nuances of global politics recently. They seem to have allowed themselves to become too reliant on The US for support and now The US is backing off somewhat they're panicking and thus have been emitting a kind of air of desperation.
Could we just stop supporting Israel? 
Man, they can just fuck right off.  If US wasn't playing big daddy,  they wouldn't be around to say this. 
That cool...so can we cut our funding to them? They seem fine just on their own.
For Netanyahu, anyone opposed to his views his anti-semitic. 
This accusation gets throwed so fucking much, it starts to get annoying...
AIPAC is too strong. The second most amount of lobbying funds in Washington
Kerry has at least a mental age of 14, maybe even 15.
Remember the USS Liberty. 
Israel could literally shit on us and you would hear our government defending them.  
We're literally their only friend in the entire world.   Yet they continually spit in our face and kick our shins.   I really don't get it. 
HAHAHA and we are still giving them billions of our money. 
Don't worry. The Israelis also claimed Iceland was Anti-Semitism when Reykjavík boycotted Israeli products in support of Palestinian independence. 
Israel to the US: Jump / US: How high?
Dear Israel,
Go Fuck yourself. My taxes shouldn't support you assholes. 
Sincerely, Taxpayer. 
it's time to cut Israel's aid budget. They can't go on biting the hand that feeds them like this. 
We should stop funding their shit war regardless of what that guy said. Israel is an awful oppressive country, but even if it wasn't, our tax money is going towards this garbage that has nothing to do with us. The government can overspend on things like this when we aren't billions and billions in debt.
Please stop giving them money. Period.

John Kerry got medals like 3 purple hearts and shit.

Dude is a patriot and Benny Hill here can go fuck himself.
Why do we even entertain the idea of Israel as an ally of the USA? What does America get out of this? These guys are serious dicks.

This is in reference to the far rightwing Israeli government, not the general population of the nation.
hahaha oh well

So... I guess "The United States" is composed entirely of Obama and Kerry?

Because I'm not the least bit offended.
"I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country's military industrial complex" - Said Dick Cheney in his resignation letter to Haliburton.

Seems to me the Israelis are spot on with their comments. 
Why was he Insulting 12 year olds?
Fuck Israeli leaders. Worthless pricks.
Seriously, fuck Israel already with their constant arrogance. How is an alliance with them of any benefit to the United States? We really need to consider shopping for a new strategic partner in that region.

And how much longer are they going to be able to play the anti-Semitism card whenever things don't go their way? World War II ended 70 years ago, and most people below the age of 50 are not going to be swayed by guilt tripping anymore. 

You know how you create anti-Semitism? By doing a lot of the shit that Israel does. The stuff that Orthodox Jews pull in places like Lakewood NJ doesn't help, either.
Israel is like our abusive girlfriend: useless, talks shit behind our back, and always takes our generous gifts with a smile because once in a while she might suck our dick.
...okay, I'll be the first to say this... why can't we just end this alliance with them? Exactly what benefit do we get out of them being allies? Mossad and that's about it?
Can't all of us Americans agree to a collective fuck you Israel? Let's spend that money at home. 
They ought to be nicer to people funding their violence. Why don't we also remember that the US is literally giving away money to Israel for no good reason, money that would be much more helpful in America, than being used to kill palestinians. 
They like to do that a lot don't they? Accusing everyone of antisemitism.

Hey I'm boycotting Israeli products to show my support for Palestine and I don't want my money used to help shell Arab civilians = anti-semite 
Israelis and their extreme overuse of accusing people of being anti-semites is making me into an anti-semite.

Funny how that works.
Okay. So maybe the US government should stopping giving them my taxes. 
Netanyahu has turned Israel into a disgrace. Don't give them the 5 billion dollar aid. Israel is not our ally. Ungrateful pigs. 
Motherfuckers, respect who you're talking to. Without our aid you'd be just as fucked as the rest of the Middle East. 
Hey Netanyahu, connect the dots-

Israel has a lot of nerve, without the US they'd be a big crater.
so an Israeli claiming someone is anti-Semitic is now news?
Netanyahu and his posse are batshit crazy war criminals, what else is there to talk about?

"Hey Obama U SUCK!

"Hey OBAMA USuck but We need another 5 Billion for Panzers pwease!
Israel is being a cunt again? Sacks of shit. 
Is it just me, or is everyone tired of Israel's shit?
jeez....why are they giving Kerry so much credit. 
Please stop voting for democrats and republicans who give money to Israel.  I'm sure there are many good people in that country, but they are grown adults and don't need us anymore.
A little child punching their 6' 5" 225 lb. dad.
You're either pro-Israel all the way or an anti-Semite. 

No middle ground. 
Can we cut the allowance we send to these children?
This is proof that the US should not give in to supporting Israel blindly. Having someone hold  "anti-semite" over your head is just blackmail. I don't have anything against Israel, but they shouldn't just expect the support of the US for no reason.
Just remember where your money goes every paycheck. 
I fucking hate the Israeli government. Fucking. Hate.
Most people seem to forget that the United States are not doing this for charity. It is vital for their agenda to destabilize that region and Israel-Palestina mutual hatred is a tool to achieve that. 
I'm so sick of Netanyahu's racism and ableism.
The US literally sucks his dick every day, and then he talks shit.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you, you moronic PM. 
Ok, so lets stop sending them money then...
Meanwhile, Hillary just wrote the biggest ass lick lover letter to Israel.
Let's stop giving things to Israel and cut off all ties.  If they're going to be this way, we shouldn't hold their hand.
ITT:people making good points and Zionist pieces of shit calling us anti-Semites. What a time to be alive. I love my Jewish brothers and sisters, but Israel needs to Chill the fuck out.
Our allies ladies and gentlemen. Any time you criticize Israel, that's anti Semitism. Fuck Israel. We need to stop giving them money and focus on our own problems.
Haha, fuck Netanyahu and his cabinet.  Fucking Revisionist scum like him have no place in this world.
Says Israel - the country that literally embodies the spirit of a big baby... Why do we even still give them an allowance? They were old enough to move out of the house, yet we still are paying for their rent! We just throw money at them while they laugh and talk shit about us behind our backs, and we expect them to respect us?
Hey, I have an idea. Fuck Israel. Let them live without the US' money for a year or five and see how it goes.
Fuck that warmongering asshole.
Farting on a Friday is anti-semetic according to the Likud party.
Israel is angry that getting the US to baby feed them isn't as easy as when Bush was in office even though they are getting breast fed by the US every day regardless.
With friends like Isael who needs enemies 


C'mon politicians.    END THE AID NOW. 

If Israel retaliates,  start buddying up with Egypt, Palestine &amp; Assad.


Its so ironical  - every time we see an Israeli leader abuse Obama, and then ask for Billions of dollars of weapons assistance at the same time. 
Can we stop kissing Israel's ass now, please. Israel's problems are not the US's problems.
About time we stop kissing Israeli ass.
So they want more money to imprison the Palestinians eh? Netanyahu must be anti-Palestinian, with the mental capacities of Hitler.
Republicans to spin this as Obama insulting Israel in 3...2...1...
Fuck Netanyahu. He is about as much of a scumbag as Putin.
How many insults does it take for America to just say "fuck you" to Israel? There is no need for us to give them any aid.


Free Palestine.
I mean the John Kerry statement  is pretty true 
Why do we continue to give this country foreign aid?
Talk about hitting a home run!

Maybe turn off the iron curtain for a few weeks
Yeah but they don't want an apology for that guy saying, on camera, that he controls America. 

And then he has the balls to wonder where the anti Semitism comes from
And we keep supporting Netanyahoo why?
Black people get blamed for pulling the race card even despite many times it is completely warranted yet Jewish people can accuse people of anti-semitism if you do not kiss their ass. Fuck Israel...getting really tired of their shit. 
Israel is a threat to world peace. They are not a peaceful country.
Fun fact (or not so fun): Israel attacked the USS Liberty in 1967 during the Six Day War and killed 34 American sailors and wounded almost 200 more. According to many reports and eyewitnesses who were there, this was intentional and possibly even a false-flag attack to pin the blame on the Egyptians and draw America into the war. Ever since then, the American government has been covering it up to protect this "strategic" relationship with Israel and the survivors were told to hush up about it.

Just thought I'd mention since, ya know, billions of our tax dollars are going towards those "God's chosen" people. Billions that could be spent at home.

Man fuck Israel. They provide us nothing but headaches. They keep electing a genocidal maniac for prime minister yet we keep giving them money. There's no oil, no resources, just religious nutjobs killing each other
Why you continue you support these slimy pieces of shit is absolutely beyond me.
Fuckin' Israel from a political standpoint is like a bitchy little sibling. They go to school every day and act like douches to everyone around them and they get away with it because they have a big brother (U.S.) looking over them. Then when they don't get what they want, they start calling names and shit.

This mother fucker is 66 years old and he's pulling the "Woe is poor little Jew-y me!" and "John Kerry's as dumb as a 7th grade kid!"

Grow the fuck up.
Fuck off Israel.
Great way to jump into the international limelight as a communications director lol 
Yeah. Obama should call up Bibi and tell him to fire his ass or you get no money.
Yeesh you'd think a communications director would be more on top of something like this. Delete your damn facebook 
The real question is if this is an insult to 12 year olds.
Are we offended enough to stop giving them $3B/yr?  No?  Then why is this news?
The COMMUNICATIONS director? REALLY?
And the tax payer money continues to flow.......
&gt;suggesting that Secretary of State John Kerry had the mental abilities of a 12-year-old

To be fair, he *did* have the mental abilities of a 12-year-old...when he was 12 years old.
Yeah like they really give a fuck...
well here's the reality: you put a republican in the white house, they will continue to receive significant funding regardless of comments like these. you put a democrat in and our ties will them will start to diminish which could either be good or bad and to be frank, them as our only 'ally' in the middle east is becoming less and less untrue.
https://mobile.twitter.com/YoSoyDalia/status/312642967993217024/photo/1
And in response, the United States will *only* be giving $2.75 billion next year instead of the $3 billion it would have given.

*(joking.. there's nothing Israel can do to make the US give less than it does.)*
To be fair, be also said some fairly disparaging things about Israel's president
Wouldn't it be smarter to just ignore those comments? 
I do not take offense, &amp; I am one American, therefore I represent all of us.
Well hes not wrong about John Kerry, the dude never got a single A in college.
In an angry show of force the USA decided to increase military aid to israel by another 10 billion dollars in retaliation.


United States takes offense? All of them?
Never bite the hand. 
Then do something about you little bitch. 'Aww my feels are hurt'... Wtf. 
Politicians are childish. Really... Someone called me a bad name, waa.  Now apologize to your sister. 
Haha, they're mad that we won't go along with their greater Israel plans
that was very unfair to a lot of twelve-
year olds...
I have heard John Kerry speak and there is no way he is that smart. 
No I don't. I don't remember voting to confirm that I feel offended.
Maybe a few individuals in the administration are offended, but most definitely, the entire country is not offended.  
One day we will stop thinking of them as an ally. Wtf will they do then?
Bernie Sanders was the first senator to announce that he would boycott the speech Netanyahu made to the U.S. Congress.

Bernie stands up to the tough guys.  He is a leader.
Never bite the hand that feeds you.
Two offenses in two years? Last year they called Brazil a diplomatic dwarf, now Israel is offending the US, what are they trying to accomplish with that?
If Sanders wins, it would be hilarious to hear Netanyahu try to call him and anti-semite.
So uh, cut off the money pipe?

Israel is a racist apartheid state and the U.S. should completely cut off all financial and military aid to them.
Good grief, why are we still their ally?
Israel biting the hand that feeds them again... 

"What do you mean your missile shield is offline? I'm sure we had been financing it... whoops, guess I am just stupid!"
Fuck the Israeli government 
Well he's not wrong about Kerry...
Netanyahu is due in Washington on November 9 to renew the military agreement, he will demand to have the military aid increased to 4.3 billion a year, and this is what they are saying about you behind your backs and facebook? You are suckers America you need to dump this  girlfriend, she is bad news.
Did our checks bounce?
Meanwhile the U.S. continue to fund their ethnic cleansing campaign.   So disgusting. 
Great friends you've got there America...
Sweeping generalization: in my experience, 100% of people from Israel are dicks. 
Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.
Netanyahu is really loosing his mind. He's causing more trouble than he's worth. 
Why does the US even give a rat's ass about Israel?
Well they might not be too far off.
Why do we spend ANY money on the middle east?  Why?  Seriously.

We can make our own oil.  Let them all kill each other.
well, he's not wrong
Isreal sucks 
I can't wait until Israel realizes that the unconditional U.S support it's been receiving for 70 years isn't going to last forever. Eventually the American masses are going to realize what's going on over there is nothing short of apartheid, and AIPAC won't be able to bully politicians with accusations of antisemitism for not supporting that apartheid. Give it a couple decades.
Lol so true. Can't wait for trump 2016 babayyyyyyy
[deleted]
The anti-semite card is getting old now. 
Who cares what that racist warmonger says. We should just ignore Israel from now on.

Obama has spent billions of dollars on Israel. He is no more anti-Israel than Bush or Clinton or Bush or Reagan or Carter. Also, you can be anti-Israel without being anti-Semitic (Obama and Kerry are neither). As a Jew, I find it incredibly annoying when people (including other Jews) think that I have to support Israel 100% of the time because I am Jewish. Catholics apparently don't have to support the Pope. Muslims don't have to support Saudi Arabia. So why are Jews expected to support Israel?
Got no problem with israel or it's people but I got a major problem with Bibi and his bitches. 
So when I see in a headline that "country is offended," what's that even mean? Because I don't remember seeing that one on the ballot on Tuesday to determine if we are, in fact, offended as a nation. 
Why not just stop funding Israel and their terrorizing of the Palestinians.
Fuck everything about Israel.
Netanyahu is the poster boy for anti-semitism.
If this isn't biting the hand that feeds them. Good luck, Israel.
WTF? Seriously? I mean, what in fuck possessed that idiot to say something like that? Has the Israeli government kicked him out of the job yet? Was there any signs that he was that fucking nuts before he was assigned to the position? If there were, who decided that it would be a good idea to give him the job?

So many questions...
Well its a good thing we'll keep giving them money and selling them weapons 
Would you bite the hand that feeds?
"Don't mistake our generosity for weakness"
You guys are having the biggest young liberal circlejerk in the world right now. You're all so smug too! If you'd even bothered to read, you'd know that the comments were made by someone who *wasn't even part of Netanyahu's "cabinet" yet.* Bibi has decided to leave him off the group now that these comments have been exposed.

Clearly, this cute Obama administration debacle has just conveniently slipped your minds. Nobody got fired over these unbelievably inappropriate comments:

&gt;Over the years, Obama administration officials have described Netanyahu to me as recalcitrant, myopic, reactionary, obtuse, blustering, pompous, and “Aspergery.” (These are verbatim descriptions; I keep a running list.)  But [until now] I had not heard Netanyahu described as a “chickenshit.”

But one random Israeli calls someone antisemitic and you guys flip over in hysteria. 

Get a fucking grip on reality. 
I'm not offended in the slightest.
Boy does he have their number! Too funny.
[deleted]
Another one from Israhell....

And they dont care...
So Netanyahu goes behind Obama's back to attack and disrespect him in front of Congress, and this man accuses Obama of antisemitism for having an issue with it
can we please stop having a "special relationship" with these asshats?
Probably not a good idea to trash talk the leaders of a country who've been giving yours 3 billion dollars a year.
Fuck the Israeli government. They long for the bush years when someone was on their "level." 
Zionism reminds me of Scientology. They believe in their cult and anyone who doesn't grovel at their feet is viciously attacked.
Fuck that lying, warmongering piece of shit. His hypocracy includes, but is not limited to, allowing his barbaric settlers to commit atrocities against palestinian refugees.
Seriously, fuck Israel biting the hand that feeds. Its ridiculous that American tax payers have to foot the bills of such a shit regime. The US should cut all aide and let the "chosen" people deal with things on their own. 
Fuck these guys, let them rot. We need to stop funding these assholes. 
[deleted]
I've asked this before on reddit and received no acceptable answers, so I'll try again:  why do we continue to believe that Israel is our ally?  What do they provide for us, from a realist perspective?  I don't want to hear any bullshit about how it's "their" land or historical claims or anything like that.  I'm asking only "what does the U.S. get in exchange for its support of Israel?"  I'm sick of this Netanyahu cunt looking down his nose at the U.S. billions.  If you've got this Bibi, go on with your bad self.  We're out.  
Well they aren't exactly wrong about Kerry.
At least when they speak the truth it gets attention.
Go ahead, keep pissing off your only ally. 
You know what? I'm tired of the Isrealis, fuck 'em and stop sending them $ billions every year. That's is so fuckin insane when we have so many infrastructure needs here. Fuck 'em and all their anti-Semitism whining.
Perhaps it's time to stop sending them money. 
Cut them off. Let them defend that little sand patch on their own. It's time we quit letting a 2000 year old book of fiction dictate our foreign policy.  
Fuck em, the ungrateful little welps. Get our troops out of the middle east and start spending those tax dollar here at home. Let Israel deal with the Arab world on their own.
I don't understand why the US are still allies with these fools. It still baffles me.
That is pretty funny. Israel would not exist at all and could not sustain itself without handouts from the United States. 

The American public supports Israel less and less every day. It is only a matter of time until the United States drops Israel off the welfare list.
Huh, I didn't realize people were protesting in the streets against ISIS in ISIS held areas,

"In the meantime, dozens of people took to the street in Manbij to protest against ISIS atrocities. However, the group opened fire on the protesters, killing at least two and wounding several others. The rest of the protesters were arrested, said activists in Manbij. 

This is the third protest organized by the people of Manbij in two months, calling for the departure of the terror group from their city and denouncing its violations against civilians."
It's sad he had to take his own life, but I'm glad he put down some ISIS scum before he did. Wish more people were able to do so without putting themselves at risk.
Source ABNA24.con aka Ahlul Bayt News Agency, a Shia "news" site with zero credibility. 

some great "news" from the site:

Israel is blame for Paris attack - says Dutch politician! 

Imam Khomeini's philosophical character introduced in Senegal!

Over 200 Syrian children shot killed just in one minute by ISIS militants!
Good. 

I'm only saddened that he didn't take more ISIS douchebags with him. I'm also saddened to hear that the little protest they had against ISIS rule in that town was immediately squashed. That's how ISIS rolls, unfortunately. However, that'll come back to the bite them in the ass, hopefully with a lot more incidents like this.
Brave people.  I can't imagine the pain of my family being killed, let alone so violently.  Horrible.
Good. This is how ISIS will be beaten. Not by us denouncing them, not by bombing the place, but by the locals getting tired of their shit and slitting their throats in their sleep.
The biggest victims are those people, they don't have anyone or anything to protect their self. 
Not just his brother, but two MORE of his family members as well. I'd probably do the same to be honest.
I always wonder with this type of news...

Who was the judge? (no name)
Who was the Syrian man? (no name)
Any sort of evidence? pictures of the protest? something?

I believe things are like shit in ISIS controled zoned, but this smells hard to propaganda everybody is eating with the mouth wide open.
The towns people have had it
   I will ask any doubters, Americans in particular, to read this please: First of all, I am a veteran, and served my country in the early 70's. Now, I am retired. My retirement home includes a small 'graveyard' on the property, which includes 9 gravestones. In the middle, is a stone for a man named Paul Braman, who was born in 1744, and who served in the American Revolutionary Army for 13 years. In his time, he fought for freedom against the English monarchy (with the help of the French, by the way), against all odds. Long story short, they kinda won, despite the odds. Thus, we have America. And my wife and I have chosen to honor not only him, but the family that supported him, without much consideration for their own safety or lives. They are true heroes to me in every sense of the word.
   Having said that, I will say this about ISIS and the Muslim community in general. I know many who practice the Islamic faith, and it is rare that I have felt 'put off' by their views. In fact, I would say that most seek to find a peaceful relationship with most, if not all other religions of the world. They understand that all of the 'fundamentals' are connected/intertwined. I refuse to believe that they, or even our government (American) are casting a dark view on Islam, or on being a 'Muslim.' In fact, I believe that, against all odds, there are many Muslims who qualify as true heroes of today, much like Paul Braman, who choose not to stand idly by, when there is clearly an injustice. They are on the front line, sacrificing their lives against a future they may never get to enjoy. As far as I'm concerned, THAT is the definition of bravery. And I truly believe there are many Muslim heroes who will die, at the hands of ISIS, without being named.

TL;DR: Let the downvotes begin.
What is the crime that the ISIS judge was passing judgement on, that led to the sentence involving 3 beheadings?
You know, sharia's not so bad, it's just a civil system that Musl....

oh, hell, i can't say that with a straight face.
this are the kind of news our newstation should report that those people in europe who want to join ISIS see that nobody likes them even at their own territory
Remember a while back when that father shot 8 ISIS soldiers because they killed his son since he was western educated?

Stuff like this is only going to increase in frequency.
It's shameful on his neighbors he felt he had to off himself to avoid retribution.
ISIS's Islam is the same as the one preached in Saudi Arabia and in many mosques founded with SA's money all over the world, including in Western Europe.
Stopping this extreme state sponsored propaganda and allowing only religious teachings which complies with the existing democratic laws will help much more than the continuing the mantra "the root of the problem is neither immigration nor Islam."
Jesus they're gonna need a second memorial just for his gigantic balls.
what? Daesh actually has a court system? 
If it was my brother I may do the same thing. I don't blame the guy, I respect him. 
These people who want to fight ISIS should be infiltrating ISIS.  They killed those who you love?  Join their organization, earn their trust, and when they least expect it, blow their plans to pieces by destroying them and their infrastructure which allows them to fight.
WTF?  It seems like less that 1.5 yrs ago we were all like who is ISIS and now they have courts and judges?
this website link is cancer
This can't be true, all comments lately told me every Syrian man is a terrorist.
That's why we can't glass them.
A little late to the party, but hey, here's my story.

I keep on hearing from a number of people why our governments are not doing more to bomb ISIS held areas. People don't seem to understand that not all the people that are living in ISIS controlled areas are their supporters. I have family members, and family friends who were unlucky enough to be in Mosul when ISIS rolled into town and declared it as part of their territory. 

I had a family member who managed to escape Mosul by walking all the way through the desert to Turkey to escape. I've still got family friends living there now unable to leave. 
I don't think protesting is going to do them any good,  unless they're protesting with loaded guns.  
So Courageous, may he rest in peace 
Rip hero
Good.
Good KDR.
Looks like there is trouble in terrorist town.
Karma is a bitch
ISIS are a bunch of jerks aren't they 
I wish there were a way for this to be peacefully resolved, but you cannot reason with ISIS. 
Part of me thinks this belongs in uplifting news.
I believe according to Sith law he now becomes the master. 
My mental image of what happens in a [Daesh courtroom](https://youtu.be/qXbXFJxltyo)
It just goes to show that the people living under their farcical rule need even more help than we do. Every now and then, we face a tragedy. They *live* the tragedy.

We really ought to start thinking up of a long-term plan to help the Middle East develop. Bombing ISIS is all well and good, but bombs won't stop another group from rising up after ISIS is dead.
I remember the story of the man who lost both his sons to terrorist attacks who then took his AK and opened fire on a group of terrorists to avenge his sons, killing seven, before getting shot dead himself. 

If someone finds the source for that, I'd highly appreciate it. 
/r/JusticePorn 
Someone give this man his well deserved Medal of Bravery.
Make this man a hero reddit!  This is what needs to happen.
I only wish he didn't commit suicide and took more with him.
I didn't realize people were protesting in the streets against ISIS in ISIS held areas
"Judge"

"Court"

Angry me says "Yes!"

Sad me says "But, the violence will continue."

Resolute me asks "How can it end?"



I am flummoxed that we DON'T hear more about the anti-Daesh protests in these affected cities.  It completely stands to reason that you wouldn't want to be living under their terrorist rule...and no wonder you'd be terrified to try and stop them.  Fucking monsters.
hero.
.....Daesh Sharia court........
This story is strangely poetic...to take your own life just to avenge your brother! 
I am all for peaceful protest, but when the people you are protesting would rather kill you than listen, it may be in your best interest to start fighting back. 
What is ISIS? Did you mean DAESH?
Geez!…Life over there is like a Quentin Tarantino movie.
Hats off to the bravery of Syrian Man. I wish if he had a bomb and destroyed the whole ISIS terrorist presented there along with that bastard judge.
OK so the site is down as expected, can someone post the summary please
This is why we shouldn't bomb blindly.
If we bomb a city to kill 100 terrorist and end up killing 1000 person (90% innocent) we are doing more harm than good.

RIP to this man he is a hero in his own way. He didn't  make a big difference by killing 3 out of thousands of terrorists but he sure proved that as a muslim he is against their atrocities and displqyed that by acting (unlike many other people including myself who do nothing but talk) 
Everyone seems to be shitting their pants over ISIS, but you should hate them for helping to strip away civil liberties. It is because of them that your children will have barcodes on their necks. They are tools that authoritarians will use to clamp down on free society.
I want to open up an honest debate about this liberal mindset that has seemingly taken over much of the world. You always seem to know what the solution is not, and ridicule others for mentioning what their opinion is, but I have not once yet heard a good solution for how to solve the ISIS problem from a liberal. The sense I get from most of you is, run, you shouldn't have to fight, no one should have to. On that note, I absolutely agree, no one should be forced to fight. I am against war entirely. But how do you stop war without war? Do you simply think you can negotiate with ISIS and turn these guys into good people? Do you think taking in all the people of the Middle East as refugees and letting ISIS control it is the solution? I really want to know, because all I hear from you is bashing others, calling them racist, cowards, but still no solutions. This seems to be a common theme with liberals on many fronts, and it's scary because they are probably the overwhelming majority. You can apply this idea to more than just the ongoing war, things like our economy, minimum wage, pretty much anything. You have ideas but no idea how to actually put that idea in motion, or if it would even work. I understand you want to make the world a better place, as do I, but you seemingly have no sense of how things actually work in the world. Can you imagine if this  mindset existed for more than just the past 10 years or so? Please, I would like to have an actual discussion with people that are open to exploring ideas, and not just shutting down others because they don't agree. 
why are there not drones floating around above there waiting to kill them?
Good to see that Kickstarter campaign "Abdul wants to avenge his brother by killing an ISIS judge... $200" paid-off.
if your law is going to be dictated by violence, imo, fair enough. Guy beheads your bro, behead him back.

Backwards and barbaric as fuck, but by that logic, fair enough.

Lesson to be learnt is: don't fight violence with violence if you want a society that can scale up.
Kinda wish he lived, but it took balls to do this instead of running to Europe to complain about Sweden being cold.

For all of you asking, why don't Muslims stand up against ISIS?

So is this a new kind of counterterrorism?
this sounds completely made up
I salute the Syrian man.. RIP... All countries come together to finish ISIS and such organization.. Humanity is being lost.
The revolution is eating its own
Allah bless that man!

edit: typo
Why is that building still intact?
It is getting pretty depressing that the only news that comes out of Iraq and Syria at this point that gets attention from anyone online are the most violent stories.
 
Let's not forgot that ISIS was originally supported by the populations (until they started doing the same things to them) of northern Iraq and Syria (North Syria, especially with Turkish borders) and it played a major role in them taking over large swathes of land, in addition to the Iraqi military incompetence, support by Turkey, Saudi Arabia and a few other small gulf states escalated their rise. I think they only turn against them when ISIS starts doing same thing to them.


What a bullshit news source.
Boogeyman down, boys.
This is a great story! 
Nobody likes a bully. 
So a group comes into existence because there was a regime that was killing protestors, takes over some of the areas, then promptly starts killing protestors - a complete horrible circle.
mmmmmm I love the taste of revenge.
Next Quentin Tarantino movie confirmed.
I feel terrible for this guy but at least he got revenge on that son of a bitch.
Justice at its best
Why don't we support these kinds of people took to the insult.
Eye for an eye mentality.  
Its really too bad he didnt get to kill more. 
Did it disturb anyone else that the [adjective hierarchy](http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adjectives/order-of-adjectives/) was off?  I reread that "a Syrian young man" sentence 4 times.  
I want to know if Assad is in the guy's side or the judge's side.
if someone did this to my brother, I would hope I would react the same. brave, noble man. rest in peace.
&gt;  In the meantime, dozens of people took to the street in Manbij to protest against ISIS atrocities. However, the group opened fire on the protesters, killing at least two and wounding several others. The rest of the protesters were arrested, said activists in Manbij

Remember folks when people say bombing Raqqa it's a necessity.  
There are innocent people living there, some can't leave the city. 
We shouldn't even mention the title of judge concerning this criminal.
I hope he said something cool as he did it.
I wonder who would have found him in contempt of court if he hadn't killed himself after the murder.
Eye for an eye, I guess
I would have tried to take more of those asshats with me on my way out as a last fuck you, but at least he achieved some sort of closure before he went
The problem with building a thrown with bayonets is you can't sit on it for long.

Justice
And the cycle continues.
Good, let them fight for their country instead of expecting everyone else to either fight for them or take them in...
Boom!  Now things are getting good!
These refugees cant be trusted 
Why arent those images of Raqqa everywhere.   Everybody needs to see and know this.  How do people lose their humanity enough to do this?
"Nice shooting son, what's your... Oh. Never mind" 
It's sad because these people are trying their best to leave this horror, nightmare, living hell. The place they are trying to get to is a place where most of the people will hate them due to the fact that they came from areas such as this.First world Muslims will talk about how their religion is peaceful, and some will the join the army to even help defend their citizens. But when people say they do nothing to stop other Muslims (Who are not even true Muslims). Those people tend to be the people who do not care about the news, or use click-bait articles as their reference point. Those also tend to be the same people who do not welcome the refugees.  It is sad, and I wish these people the best of Luck. Fuck anything that was like ISIS, Fuck anything that is ISIS, and Fuck anything that will become like ISIS... Fuck ISIS
What is the crime that the ISIS judge was passing judgement on, that led to the sentence involving 3 beheadings?
Holy shit. These people have some fucking balls.
May he finally find peace in his world...
This is GREAT news!

That's awesome that he smoke the asshole, but I wish he wouldn't have killed himself.
best thing about this story is people finally standing up and saying fuck no not in my town. I hope they prevail. As for old mate that killed himself, I guess he was a realist and had seen or heard about the guys getting burnt alive, I would think that a gun shot to the head would be preferable.
God be with you, brother.
What that guy did was alpha as fuck. Respect
STOP KILLING EACHOTHER
I thought Muslims were peaceful
Good for him, only mistake was killing himself, he should have kept killing medina muslims until killed. 
In the end of the day, it's not bombs and troops that will fully bring down ISIS, but it's the people within ISIS that can fully bring down ISIS - people fed up with the atrocities of ISIS and its short-minded and violent vision. In the end, humans just want peace and prosperity and ISIS will never be able to ensure that. 
Sharia Law is a joke as is the morons that follow it..

Talk about losing your head...ba dum tiss
So why is the west not supposed to attack ISIS again?.

It seems to me you will only be helping people like him...
Oh i forget you will make Muslims mad for attacking the dude beheading Syrians.
So even the Syrian civilians don't want ISIS and they do their best to get rid of them by protesting and they get killed by ISIS...they do nothing and WE Kill them with bombs :/
all syrian men should go in syria and FIGHT ISIS in syria
If we executed every judge in every Sharia court in the world, would the Earth be a better planet?
Remembah, it's DAESH (not *ISIS*). Shukran.

You should always respect the law. Even if you don't agree with it. Otherwise we have anarchy.
And US calls themselves a super power.
Lets pretend the entire Muslim and no Muslim world is shocked and outraged by ISIS and that they don't have hundreds of millions cheering from the sidelines 
The law is the law. The man now will face the consequences. Wow it is so easy to be a statist!
And this is why I'm so against immigration. This is 100% the best way to get rid of ISIS.
I can`t stand any of these backward people. but at least they have to guts to get into the streets for something besides making college presidents quit. There is finally going to be a toll for the dems aligning themselves with terrorists and other scum.
Good. Now kill the rest of Islam so we don't have to deal with this shit again.
Those Syrians love Sharia law. Expect to see some of this in Europe now.
So, still want those refugees, anyone?
Realistically, will they see any backlash for doing so?
You can't really say the world is 'stunned'. Many people should have seen this coming. 
&gt; Japan stuns no-one by continuing to not give a shit

Would be a more appropriate title.
Man they really like whaling
I'm sure they are only doing it to prevent sea levels from rising.
By removing those big whales the sea levels will drop.

It is basic science 
Their scientific research is not yet complete, nor will it be until they successfully science the fuck out of those whales.
Don't worry, China will make more.

I'm sure as usual people will bring up the fact that mink whales are not endangered, which might be true, but that's not even the biggest problem with whaling. The biggest problem is that there is no way to humanely kill an animal that large. Most suffer for several minutes, some up to half an hour or even longer while they are continuously blasted with harpoons. It's atrocious.
No one is stunned by this. Quite honestly more people would have been stunned if they were told Japan ever stopped at all. 
I think most people disgusted by this aren't mad because of whales are perceived as endangered - because the whale species being hunted are most certainly not close to being endangered.

I think it has more to do with the fact that these are highly intelligent animals who understand levels of pain and loss and are put through prolonged periods of agonizing pain and suffering while being killed to "preserve the meat".

Most whales aren't even killed by the harpoons or even by bleeding out; most drown. So imagine being scared / lured to the surface by sonar only to be harpooned in the tail and then just being dragged along this boat while you slowly drown (while still harpooned and attached to this boat).

That is why I think most people take issue with this. Not to mention the fact that the meat is nearly all wasted since it's not even a demanded commodity and hardly anyone over there even eats it.

The world needs more stun resistance. 
I don't get it and as a Japanese I'm ashamed my country keeps hunting for them.  Never ate them either in my life as they cannot be bled properly which means you're eating quite a bit of blood (as much as I love meat in general).
If they are carrying out illegal fishing then the navy impounds the ship and jails the caption until the penalty is paid.

Misleading title. Literally no one should be surprised, much less stunned, by this revelation.
They have been whaling constantly under the guise of research programs since 1988 with plenty of opposition.  That they are continuing to do so for a 28th consecutive year cannot be described as 'stunning'.  Sounds like a biased news rag to me.
Japan-"haha well what're you even gonna do about it"
Stunned world-"oh yeah that's true"
FUCK YOU WHARU!! ANDU FUCK YOU DORPHIN!!
How is this stunning? It would be stunning If they said they'd stop...
Yarrrrr. Where would we today without good old fashioned whale oil. 
Well, it's not like the rest of the world is gonna embargo them for violating the ban, being one of the biggest economies and a major US ally.
They invented Finland for this porpoise too 
I wish I could do this in Civ 5; stupid World Congress....
ELI5 what exactly is the problem if they hunt whales? Im reading that there are 800,000 whales while they are going for 333.

What am I missing here?
Misleading title, it should be "No one is stunned by Japan announcing it will resume whaling in Antarctic Ocean despite ban".
If nobody eats whale in Japan then is it all about jobs then? We have a similar situation in Canada (particularly Newfoundland) with sealing.  It does provide some fishermen with needed extra income and that's a big part of why it continues on. Hardly anyone eats seal meat but we putter on with the seal hunt every year, mainly because a lot of people just don't like hippies and mainlanders telling us what to do. There is a local market for clothing made of seal pelts. Boots, coats, etc... but hardly any for the actual meat.

We do have a small First Nations population who also have a seal hunt but those hunters pretty much get a free pass on it because it's seen as more a part of their culture rather than their white counterparts doing the same thing. It's fun to listen to anti-hunt people try to waffle around the indigenous people's hunt while condemning all other hunters for doing the exact same thing. 
As is tradition.
&gt;ban

No, the ICJ merely said JARPA I/II was against the IWC regulations due to certain issues with it. Japan is free to remake the shit as JARPA III and be perfectly in line. Not that the ICJ has any real power in any case though.

They only hunt Minke really anyway, which is completely unendangered, so not sure why so many in the west get butthurt about it. Shit tastes pretty good too.
Stuns the world? I was not stunned. Am I not of this world?
Does anyone truly feel stunned that Japan is continuing it's whaling operations?
I'm not stunned. Are you stunned? Is anyone?
Part of the world here, I'm not stunned. Not sure who is keeping score. 
This title is so stupid, no one is "stunned".
Phuck youuuuuu whaaaallle...
Why is minke whale hunting banned? Isn't it classified least concert under conservation status?
I smell a second part to a South Park episode in the works
what a bunch of (small) dicks.
Fuck Japan.
Greedy asians taking all the resources
Japan's just keeping up being a dick until World War III; traditions and all that.
For science, I presume.
Fuck Japan. All they think about is themselves. 
Isn't this cultural relativism? As long as they're not hunting endangered whales, then what business is it to the rest of the world? 

Sure, I'm disgusted by the idea of eating whale. But I imagine Indians aren't thrilled that I'm eating beef.  And Muslims are horrified that I'm eating pork.
Just submit a proposal to the World Congress to impose sanctions on them. If you're allied with enough city-states then you'll have enough delegates to pass it.
I eat beef, let them eat sea cows
Fuck you wharee, fuck you dorphun?
ITT: murderous anti-whalers
We must stop Japan. 

*Playing Dragon Quest on my PS4*
And Norway never stopped doing it. Everyone is a fucking idiot that is buying into all this Japan anti whaling shit. 

Personally I would love to see some science on how a modern whaling ship sinks when torpedoed.  I haven't seen any research.  Maybe a few of then should be sunk.  For science. 
This title is so stupid, no one is "stunned".
All I can think about is South Park:

"Ughh. Fuuuuuck youuu whale and fuuuuuck youuu dolpheeeen!"
Never understood why killing one animal species is fine but killing another, especially one in such abundance, is an outrage.
Us Japanese have been eating whales for about a few hundred years now.
It is a kind of a culture that many people misunderstand.
For us, eating whales is no different to eating beef.
Assholes. 
I'm not sure if this has been mentioned elsewhere, but one of the main motivations behind the Japanese whale hunt is that many Japanese believe that the soul of one animal is no less important than that of any other, and that it is therefore less sinful to eat a few gigantic animals than lots of smaller ones. 

Tried to find a relevant link, couldn't. But it's true.
Whale is delicious, my students and I had it for lunch recently. There's a lot of little whaling towns where I live. It looks like a proud tradition. They have pictures on the walls of the boats bringing in the whales. Will post pics if you want.
Country keeps eating animals they´ve been eating for thousands of years. What a surprise.

As long they're not extincting a specific whale what the fuck is the problem? They're killing 333 Minke Whales out of the the 515000 Minke Whales in the world. Also they're not the only country in the world hunting fucking Minke Whales. Norway and Iceland do exactly the same thing. Norway even seems to kill more Minke Whales than Japan.

If it was some sort of endangered whale, sure, penalize them. But killing a couple hundred whales out of 515000 every year is just too insignificant to care about.
I for one have no problem with the hunting and consumption of non-endangered species. 
All they're doing is hunting a non endangered animal. Wtf is so wrong about that? It's not like whales are a keystone species anyway.
Why is it all the animals i want to try eating are off-limits?
"Fuck da po-reese"
People are mad for the wrong reasons. Japan defies international Law and might get away with it. Then what is the purpose of international law? 
I'm surprised that no one had mentioned Finland

https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qjohv/what_did_your_parents_show_you_to_do_that_you/cn71tnd?context=10000
There should be more outrage about this. The whales need to be protected. Japan shouldn't get a free pass to keep doing it.
*Are all whales endangered?*

*No. Though there is valid concern for several whale species, not all whale populations are endangered or threatened. Killer whales are not endangered. Though hundreds of dolphins and porpoises still drown in fishing nets, the impact on most populations appears to be minimal.*

http://seaworld.org/animal-info/animal-bytes/mammals/endangered%20whales/
Fucking hate japan
Does this mean I can go on a Japanese hunt despite the ban on murder? I think it does~!
Why do people attack Japanese for whaling, while Norway and Iceland never even get a finger pointed at them?

I'm going to have to go on a limb and say that this is anti-Japonic racism.
I want to like you Japan, but then you go and do this... sheez
I don't like whales, they are my biggest fear.  I hope they get every one of them.


I also hope to upset someone on the internet today.
Good on them. Nothing wrong with sustainable whaling. 
As part of "world", I am not stunned.
Did it stun the world? Or did the guy who wrote this just want me to think it did?
Good, I don't want to become unable to stop eating whale.
Send in the Mongolians.
Im not really stunned. 
You know, as hell-bent as Japan is on robots and human-like robots and AI, you would think they would figure out how to synthesize whatever it is they want from these whales.
They will stop after last one is killed.
they are studying the effects of climate change by killing 300+ whales a year?
Japan: Cow and chicken!
Hey, I have a great Idea! Let's get China to clone whales!
Well let me be the first to say that I, along with the World, am stunned.
Well, what do they want? Is their economy bad? Do they want higher or lower of something? I feel like when nations do this it's because they want something.
[I am not surprised.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUbZJcdlcSc#t=00m07s)
Got a feeling this is just going to be a drop in the bucket when TPP gets pushed through...
The Minke whale is actually doing pretty well if you check their conservation status.  If they can be accountable with their numbers I have no issue with it.  (PS -  they are probably the most delicious thing I've ever eaten.)
I wouldn't be surprised if they started to nation build China again.
Why do they do this in the first place? I still dont know why
Sink their boats? Pretty simple solution, wtf is Japan going to do about it.
On a scale of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter to Pearl Harbor, I am I Can't Believe It's Not Butter stunned.
Honest question: What do we even need whales for in 2015? Does whale oil have properties that we can't get from plant-based or petrochemical oils? Are they particularly tasty? Is one of their organs a natural aphrodisiac?
So sorry, these whales must be killed "because global warming"
Just have China start cloning whales and we're good to go.
Because the world is on fire.  Nobody cares anymore because it's about to be WWIII
Japan, the only nation to have a space fleet and a whaling fleet.
Why can't they have a normal addiction? Like cocaine or something. At least we can synthesize that without ridding animals from this world.
A country who's main food source is fish and rice is continuing to kill whales, despite the social stigma!? 
Most of what they are, there is no demand for whale meat they get every one of them.
MOTHER FUCK, JIAN YANG.
So a new season of whale wars?
Time for war! Fuck Isis,  this is'' a real crisis''.
Not one mention of Leviathan in the entire thread? 

http://i.imgur.com/siFZb6w.jpg
I wasn't stunned 
Well atleast they grew a pair and stop being cowards hiding behind the guise of science.

Now we can see them for what they really are in the end, whale hungry savages.
Quick, someone get them the 300 or so whales that beached themselves last month.

You'd think it would be easier for them to just to wait around on a beach somewhere.

With everything else going on on our planet right now, their timing seems genious.
Finally safe to break out the old snorkel again
The world is a vampire....
They probably get paid by the whale wars people. 
Stunned? I would be stunned if they gave two shits about what anyone else thinks about their fishing business. At most they've tried being subtle by whaling for "research" purposes back around the turn of the millennium when it was making national headlines but they've done little to show they are ever going to stop.
This was listed right after the china to begin selling cloned beef article on my feed... and i saw the problem and the solution all in an instant.
I'm about to embark on an important study myself.  The study will determine how long it takes, on average, to get to the center of a whaler using nothing but sandpaper.  We set sail on the new year!
Who do they think they're fooling by calling it scientific research?
Oh whale that's no good
I thought you were cool, Japan.
right on. its one thing to regulate hunting practices in the names of extinction prevention. its another to completely stifle a cultural norm in the name of extinction prevention.
Yes! This means a new season of Whale Wars!!
F u dolphin and f you whale!!
Its bad enough that they have Fukashima polluting the Pacific and lying about it.  I am not so sure this is research on the whales.
Well that's not good. :/
time to boycott Japanese goods?
You forgot to add CHANGES EVERYTHING! to the title to qualify for a full "clickbait awards" thus you are relegated to /r/titlegore nomination.

Well, goodbye whale species. We didn't know ye
Whaling, whaling never changes.
Dicks. 
More like no one was shocked. Does anyone know wtf japan has against whales? I've heard that they don't even fucking used it or most of it goes bad. What the fuck is the point? Is it some sick game or tradition or religious thing??? I just don't get it. 
Would you say stuns or more like, not surprised.  
I'm not that stunned.
I would love to hear from everyday people in Japan about this. MY government does a lot of things the people don't like, is this a case like that?
Fuak yew dolfiiin!
Why are people stunned exactly?  This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.
I just don't understand how a country would use this as a focal point of national pride?
Did they ever even stop?
It stuns the world? It didn't stun me. What does this "world" think Japan is?
They should know it wasn't dolphin and whale but chicken and cow that bombed them. 
no one was stunned.
If this stuns you then you are a serious idiot. 
So, it's more of a whale, so that the whalers lift it up, they also put some electrodes into it and as a lifestyle choice here, not just a few old boys making money.
ITT: "no one is surprised" x1,000,000
Fooka yu WHALE!
Do they eat the whales? Why are they killing hem?
I hope a us or Russian sub bombs them 
But their soft power will make everyone love them again by ~~next week~~ the next couple of days. 
Good thing my mom doesn't live in the Antarctic ocean. 
Kill it! Kill it with (nuclear) fire!
I thought they invented Finland just so that they could do this anyway. (Seriously, there's a conspiracy theory that says Finland doesn't exist.)
Maybe  Turkey can sink the whaling ship and claim it was in their airspace?

They're clearly studying the science of whale extinction.
What do they use whales for?
there are not that many whaling ships.
just simply intercept them, remove the crews, and sink them when found.
problem solved.
I don't think many people are stunned. The US will not do anything, so really Japan does what it does. 
I... For one, was not stunned-  anybody else here stunned?   I think this title is a bit over the top 
I read he title twice, so I hurried up and checked.

I'm not stunned in the slightest. Turns out, the Japanese eat whale meat. They've been doing so for a number of years. It isn't a surprise.
Bright side: Time to fire up another season of Whale Wars!
Best part of the whale underneath the water.
Am I the only one who doesn't care enough about whales to be upset by this?
Meanwhile, nobody gives a damn about overfishing. Those populations **are** dropping, fast.
The only time it was supposed to be playing.
Cool, sink their ships. Problem solved.
The perfect amount of the worlds most advanced naval hardware.
I want to try whale meat
I thought you were going to kill less because no one even caught on until afterwards.
Something something south park
fail whale.
How dare you be logical, get out of an animal that large.
Japan, after the Rugby World Cup I thought you were really cool and hell of awesome, and so you go let me down like this? So disappointed.

How hard can it be to scuttle the damn things? If any government actually gave a rat's ass this would be a non-issue. Hell, a couple hyperbaric welders could probably do it too.
[latest news just in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E39WWj_RpBc)
What the hell, Japan? STOP IT.
What if they were like the morally superior nations and instead killed more people and fewer whales?
19:51 - Secretary of the Interior said whole city is in danger

19:55 - Public transportation in city center is partially stopped

20:03 - Police president said there was a serious plan to plant/detonate something

There will be a press conference at 20:30. 

There is SPECULATION on twitter that the police got someone ( [Picture](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CUCTiKAW4AANcxS.jpg:large) ) ( [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Jeroen_Grueter/status/666695058255650816/photo/1) ) - Press conference said there were no arrests yet, so probably not true. 

20:15 Newest info from police president is: There was a PLANNED bomb attack on the stadium

NOT YET CONFIRMED (RUMOR): [This news](http://www.kreiszeitung.de/lokales/niedersachsen/fussball-laenderspiel-rettungswagen-sprengstoff-vorm-stadion-5875541.html) and [this twitter](https://twitter.com/dw_sports/status/666698740108009472) (thanks trecht) say there was an ambulance car with explosives inside, but it was found early enough. 

Television news said Intelligence had information about an attack on the stadium earlier today. 

People also left the stadium in a coordinated manner, no mass panic. 

Link to press conference (hasn't started yet): [Link](http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/hannover_weser-leinegebiet/eventlivestream2352.html)

20:40 - News say attack was planned by Islamists. Police president said they got the decising clue 15 minutes after letting people into the stadium. What a timing. 

20:47 - Press conference delayed to 21:00. 

By the way, ZDF (German television) is trying to broadcast the game England vs France at short notice. So keep the beer cool for now. 

21:00 - A heavy police force is guarding the Ministry of the Interior. Press conference hasn't started yet. 

Missed that one: A concert hall in Hannover also got evacuated. 

21:21 - Press conference just started.

Info from Press conference (also check u/seewolfmdk comment, (s)he is doing a more detailed job at translating): 

- after Paris, there was (as usual after big attacks) a lot of clues and info about upcoming attacks. Intelligence got a lot of info just today, so they adviced politicians to cancel the game and Secretary of the Interior supported that. He also won't comment on any source or what kind of clues there were. 

- Heavy police force will keep securing Hannover so everybody is ensured to get home safe

- Secretary of the Interior DOES NOT want to comment about if there is still a threat, what kind of threat there is/was, when he got information, just ... nothing really. His reason is to not give away any information about sources or how they decide to cancel public events like that. 

- No information about found explosives and no information about arrests. No confirmation either. 

- NO CONFIRMATION about explosives inside of an ambulance truck. 

- Secretary says people should still gather and celebrate things like football or christmas (soon). Cancelling big events like today will happen on a case-to-case basis, not generally. 

- PRESS CONFERENCE IS OVER. 

If you want my personal opinion, there wasn't any important information to justify this press conference at all. He also talked in a way that I found dodgy and very, very imprecise. Since there is no confirmation for anything, they could've canceled the game just because or any other reasion. But that's just my personal point of view. 

21:30 - dpa says they have insider info that the crucial clue was coming from a foreign Intelligence Agency. 

u/try_some_ubik [Video from Hannover, police presence](https://vid.me/MElP)

u/pXmo says they check passengers and cars for IDs 

22:02 - The police minister said on television they more or less HAD to cancel when they got this "crucial clue". 



I guess I am more or less done. If anything big happens, I will still update, but I don't expect anything. More information about what happened and what kind of attack was planned will appear the next days, I guess. 

I'm just happy people are safe for now. 

Thanks for the gold! :)

22:04 - Bild (German yellow press) claim they have info that the clue came from the French Intelligence Agency. 30 hours before the game was supposed to start, they warned Germany about a group of attackers armed with explosive belts, bombs and automatic weapons. 

22:43 - Federal police is investigating a "suspicious object" inside of an InterCity train 

22:49 - Bundesliga is supposed to go on normally. If there were clues about a group armed with explosives and assault rifles and they can't find those guys, they could just try again. Really strange feeling, although keeping up our normal life is probably the best thing anyway ... 

23:40 - "suspicious object" is secured, but it's not confirmed if it is a bomb/explosive or just dummy. 

23:45 - Suspicious object was detonated in a controlled way, experts doubt it was explosive anyway. Still no explosives found or confirmed. Main train station in Hannover is operating again. 

0:00 - Not related to Hannover, but a [suicide attack happened in Nigeria](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/nigeria-market-bombing-151117213718605.html). Sigh. Hate this to be the last update for me, but I will head to bed soon. My deep condolences to the people in Yola and I hope everyone gets home safe in Hannover. 
Now all trains from the stadium have been stopped and evacuated.

EDIT: The SEK (special forces) and GSG-9 (counter-terrorism forces) are arriving.

So that World Cup in Qatar should be fun
Dear ISIS. Historically it is not a good idea to piss off the Germans and Russians, just saying.
Trying to mess with European football again??

Instead of bombing the middle east I say we send over a squadron of football hooligans armed with patio furniture to deal with ISIS. Inner city firm, Ultras, Celtic, Rangers, Boixos Nois, Boulogne Boys and Hogesas all united to take down these scum.

It would be beautiful.
Seriously what the flying fuck. Friday my friend was sick and we couldn't attend the game in Paris. 

Now we both are in Hannover and the game is cancelled. 

I must have some serious guardian angels. 

It strikes me that the only thing dumber than poking a bear is poking all of the bears. 
Platform 7 to 14 in Hannover Central Station are blocked now, police are apparently searching a train for a 'suspicious object'. Lots of stranded passengers.

It's a weird feeling right now, I am living in Hanover. Of course Paris felt close , but hearing the police/ambulance/firefighters whatever driving into the city with sirens feels a lot closer...
Terrorists can you please stop your shit? Us Europeans just want to watch football...
I'm there right now and things are so crazy here... Theres police everywhere, heavily armed, one of them told us to immediately leave the area. I feel like in civil war here in Hannover.

Edit: I won't stay here. Gonna drive home now.
Update: there was evidence of an impending attack.

The earlier found object turned out to be a false alarm. 
The attack threats/evidences were received after that object was found

___________
Edit: 20:04 stadium is completely empty and all cars in the proximity get searched, causing congestions. Still lots of people on the arenas parking spots

Edit: 20:07 policeman says that the area should be safe by now, there is no imminent danger anymore

Edit: 20:11 police is taking off bullet proof vests. Seems like the threat is really no longer 

Edit: 20:17 according to N-TV the president of the hannover police says that there was solid evidence that an attack with an explosive device was planned during the game

Edit: 20:24 it was precised that it should have been a suicide attack with an explosive belt. There is also speculation that there was a vehicle disguised as an abulance car with exploives in it. But this has not been confirmed by the police yet

Edit 20:38 according to the DPA it was a threat of a suicide attack by Islamists

Police got the crucial piece of evidence just 15 minutes after opening the gates to the stadium

Edit 20:56 police presence in the whole city, it is speculated that there were more attacks planned in other locations

Edit 21:07 bomb disposal experts were sighted at the arena

Edit 21:41 speculation that bombs were found in a vehicle or any bombs at all get rejected by press conference

Edit 21:48 press conference over, I am not any smarter to be honest. Notably: It was stated by the minister that there is some information he rather not releases because it might cause unnecessary fear among the population.

Either all the the information is wrong/just speculation or he knew about anything he really didnt want to release. I personally think that there was evidence for an act of terrorism and I really hope that I am wrong or said "evidence" was greatly exaggerated or misinterpreted

Edit: spelling and grammar
Maybe ISIS just really hates football...
Minister of the interior was just asked if the threat is still ongoing and he said "I can't answer that because my answer might scare the population". Damn.
http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/hannover_weser-leinegebiet/eventlivestream2352.html

Livestream of german government.

-  Federal Minister of the Interior decided to cancel game
- says situation was dangerous
- not easy to make this decision because we don't just want to cave to terrorism
- important hints came in very late
- can't comment on origin of information because it would help attackers
- game was to show solidarity with france, so the decision to cancel it was hard, but safety is more important
- thanks police for fast and good reaction and evacuation (Also thanks people for making no problems)
-  heavy police presence this night to show safety for people still out 
- german soccer team had to cancel second game in a few days, netherlands informed immediatly (both soccer teams brought to safe police station)

Unknown object found in hannover central station, some areas closed

- minister of interior says again that he can't answer questions because it would make the population feel uneasy and sabotage their effort to get further information

- so far no explosives found and no one arrested

- directly asked can't confirm anything about explosives in ambulance
- minister says that terrorism will not stop the german people from enjoying live and public places but still sometimes decisions like this have to be done
- police checks safety of every big public event always and early, will focus more on it in the next days
- don't think that these attacks have anything to do with soccer itself
- chancellor merkel was involved in decision process
- contrary to first claims no explosives were found in the stadium itself
It's so devastating when these terrorists succeed with any sort of attack that we overlook things like this where the good guys do a great/thorough job and unquestionably save lives.  I hope we start to do a better job of appreciating when police forces get wins like this.
It's really fascinating to see how many supposedly legitimate news media outlets will print unverified stuff they pick up from Twitter. 
So far only "babbling" about security.

Edit 1: After discussion and thinking about it, the Federal police minister recommended to cancel the game.

Edit2: The source of the threat and who gave a hint will not be published.

Edit3: It was a heavy decision, but with this level of danger, there was no other way.

Edit4: Lower-Saxon police minister now.

Edit5: The decision was difficult, he's thanking the Federal police minister and the state police.

Edit6: There was no real discussion that the game had to be cancelled.

Edit7: Police will be present in the city the whole night.

Edit8: President of German Football Association: It's sad that the game had to be cancelled. 

Edit9: It's hard that the team had to endure 2 bad situations within 4 days.

Edit10: He had been informed by the state police minister, later by the federal minister.

Edit10: The teams hadn't arrived in the stadium, they were 5km away.

Edit11: The Dutch team is on it's way back to the Netherlands via plane.

Edit13: Until tomorrow there will be stronger police presence in the city.

Edit14: No arrests, no explosives found yet.

Edit15: Was there a threat for the German team directly? Pure speculation. The security authorities did good work, not thinking about the next matches yet.

Edit16: Explosives in an ambulance? I can't confirm that 

Edit17: The team was still in shock during the last days.

Edit18: We won't change our way of life, we will visit christmas markets, matches, public meetings, but we have to be careful.

Edit19: If there are threats, it's job of the state police to evaluate these threats, but there is no reason to think that terrorists are targeting football specifically. They are targeting public meetings.

Edit20: The ministers phoned a few times over the day, the chancellor arrived in Hannover, but returned to Berlin.

Edit21: Non confirmation of explosives inside the stadium.

End. On the left: The police minister of Lower Saxony, middle: Federal police minister, right: president of German Football Association. 
Here is a Periscope stream live from the stadium: https://www.periscope.tv/w/1vAxRoYrAmXKl

Edit: The guy talking is a news reporter for BILD Zeitung by the way. Police sent people a little away from the stadium, that's why he's mainly talking now and can't show much of the scene.

Edit 2: He finished streaming now. If you click on the link though, you can replay it and see the very first moments of the evacuation.
De Maiziere:  
&gt; There are always threats and even more so after such an incident like in Paris. It's not easy to seperate real threats, police does a good work on that. Game was cancelled so late, because it was not clear for a long time, that it was a real threat.
&gt; No comments on the source and magnitude of the threats... so to not endanger those sources and guarantee future hints regarding these threats.  
&gt; Safety is more important than everything...  

Pistorius:  
&gt; Thanks to the police for their good work and the visitors for their calm and peaceful evacuation.  

Rauball:  
&gt; It's sad for all football fans and all the people who wanted to make a gesture of solidarity.  


Mostly just talk, those were the only important parts imo... :/  

Q: Is there still a threat?  
A: (ok, his answer is for a different question, did I miss something? O.o) He just says again, he won't talk about the threat level and why exactly the game was cancelled...  
It's hard to make such decisions and it's even harder to talk about the decisionmaking, because it could endanger future decisions...  

Q: Explosives found or people arrested?  
A: Nothing found, nobody arrested  

Q: Recurpussions for future games?  
A: More safety maybe, but nothing concrete.  

Q: Is it true that there were explosives found in an ambulance?  
A: No confirmation for that...  

Q: About Bundesliga-games at the weekend...  
A: Didn't answer the question at all, lol :D  
A: De Maiziere hopes that we can enjoy those events (and things like theatre, parties, etc) in the future and it will not impact the people's life too much  


Nothing serious after that, well gn8 :o  
PS damn, never having done that before... translating something live is hard o.o
All right, that's it. They may take our lives, but they'll never take our football!
Press conference now LIVE: http://www.ndr.de/nachrichten/niedersachsen/hannover_weser-leinegebiet/eventlivestream2352.html 

[in German]

EDIT Translation of main points:

* Number of hints for attacks was increasing after Paris - this is considered "normal" and does NOT necessary correlate with an increase in terrorist activites

* hints that the game was endangered increased in the early evening, game was cancelled late, because the hints came in late

* interior minister De Maizière will not comment on sources or extent of danger for the hints for reasons of national securtiy

* lower saxony's interior minister says that decision to cancel was made quickly after hints came in, thanks police and specatators for quick evacuation

* DFB group leader speaks, nothing substantial. Teams were not yet in the stadium, both teams have now been re-routed. Players from Munich were flown back to Munich, others have taken cars to get home.

* Question: Is there currently an immediate threat? What was the actual danger? Answer: De Maizière will not answer these questions. Answers could agitate the people, endanger sources and the current way German Intelligence is operating

EDIT2: Seems like the essential questions will NOT be answered tonight. For a continued sum-up, please refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3t6ra7/hannover_stadium_hosting_germanynetherlands_game/cx3ky3z) 

EDIT3: Big piece of Info: NO arrests have been made, NO explosives were found
I'm looking at the stadium from my balcony and except for more lights than usual everything seems okay. I was still in the city when the news about the bomb spread. I was wondering why the city was so dead. I actually caught the last train going 

Edit 

Just heard the sirens of the police cars goinng again. Scared shitless I am so close to city and the stadium 
Wow I'm torn right now.

Sure, don't take any chances. Noone wants to regret it later on if something happens or the "suspicious object" turns out to be a real threat.

But they were talking for days about the increased security measures, the shitload of police forces present and everything they had planned out to keep this safe with the whole german cabinet in attendance. No dice, they got us again. Scared us, made us change our ways, made us stop doing things we love.

I don't want them to have that much power over us.

two hours later it's finally on the front of reddit jeees
[German police](http://imgur.com/osbADOA)
On a side note, this waiting music for the press conference is relaxing
No explosives were found at or near the stadium yet.
If the next attack is in the Netherlands,  then we know their pattern.
Well this article is useless, it literally just repeats what the headline is saying and that's it. Why is the stadium being evacuated? Is it a false alarm or is something happening? Does anyone know what's going on?
The game has now been cancelled and the stadium began to evacuate at 18:15. 
Okay, not much info on this and OP article has literally nothing. 

&gt;Police have cancelled the friendly between Germany and Holland after the stadium in Hanover was evacuated on Tuesday when a suspicious object was found inside.

And

&gt;An announcement by police informed spectators about an hour and a half before kickoff on Tuesday, a statement later said fans should leave “quickly , but should go without panic back home. Please go in small groups back home, it’s better this way.”

So there was some threat but they don't want to give the details - am I right?
Another arena in Hannover that is holding a concert tonight is being evacuated as well right now! 
Just an update: police just stated, that the concert will actually take place! Sorry on my part.
Just have a Muhammad drawing contest. That should bring them out into the open.
The CBC is reporting a bomb threat made prior to the game:

22:22 A dog trained to find explosives found something in a train.

22:38 Suspect thing in the train shall be made undangerous by experts, no controlled explosion planned. "If there is an ignitor, it shall be made undangerous"

22:44 The thing is at least a hoax-bomb, X-Ray images showed wires, a mobile phone and some PCBs.

22:58 Police "Either it was a very good hoax or really a bomb"

23:01 Passengers in the train have seen a suspect person. When they talked to him/her, (s)he ran away. Police are looking for the person.

23:23 "According to the current status no explosives found in the device, probably a hoax." Source: Statement of the police on Facebook.
Currently there's no confirmation whatsoever what might have been planned at the stadium. Officials only have talked about some "concrete" evidence that a detonation was planned at the venue - they haven't confirmed the story about the ambulance loaded with explosives. Our Minister of the Interior, de Maiziere, has only commented that "some of the details would frighten the population". What a weird comment to make, honestly. 

Some news sources claimed that a dangerous individual ("Gefährder") was seen near the stadium - so apparently a person on the intelligence watch list (e.g., a jihadist who returned from Syria).

Apparently French investigators have also confirmed that there was a ninth terrorist during the terror attacks on Friday - so it seems that two attackers are still on the run. This is likely not related to the cancellation, though.
[We have pretty cute police!](http://cdn3.spiegel.de/images/image-923396-breitwandaufmacher-unxw-923396.jpg)
2 hours. 2 hours this took to reach the front page of Reddit for me. And reddit say they've not pissed around with the algorithms?
http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/laenderspiel-deutschland-gegen-niederlande-abgesagt-a-1063306.html
So here is a bit more (german source). Sadly I suck at translating, but basically, they say that they found a suspicious person near the stadium and the regional politician (the guy in charge of the local police) decided to cancel the game. 
The suspicious package turned out not to be a threat. 

Update: They are now also evacuating the "Tui-Arena" (around 10.000 seats) near Hannover where a concert was planned for this evening. Police say that there was/is a threat. 
Seems that Hannover is in a lockdown right now. Multiple buildings have been evacuated
I wish I spoke German right now...
Hannover Stadium is definitely a CT sided map. 
Is this the same team that was playing in Paris? 
Currently in Hannover.

Police said not to worry and we all should go home. Everyone is pretty confused and scared tbh. 

Stadium is evacuated, only police allowed to be near there. 

But no serious information about what's going on. 
[deleted]
policedog trigges at the hanover main train station and supposedly found explosives

staition is now partly locked down


UPDATE: object in train now rended harmless
https://twitter.com/NDRnds/status/666733103017250817

was at least a "fake bomb" if not more
https://twitter.com/NDRnds/status/666733964078510084
Russia and Nato need to team up to take on ISIS. Russia takes the west, Nato takes the East and we crush them. 
this PK isn't exactly calming
An example of the terrorists winning would be if nobody was at the game for fear of terrorism. Evacuating a stadium because of a legitimate threat is NOT them winning. We won you terrorist fucks.
wow finally it reached the frontpage... after i saw it on every other page and the television...

reddit fix your algorithms..
Huge props to the security here. An truck disguised as an ambulance? What the fuck man...
And how are they going to handle this problem every weekend when there is the Bundesliga?
If the bomb truck rumor is true... Sounds like there was a false alert inside the stadium followed by a real bomb outside the stadium. If that information holds, sounds like a pretty devious plan.
So if the reports of an bomb disguised as an ambulance are true. An ambulance bomb is textbook secondary attack to harm first responders.. What were they expecting them to respond to?
Better safe than sorry I guess.
[Tonight's Belgium v Spain game was also called off over security fears](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/34839734)
Damn, pissing off the French and the Germans in the same week, not a smart idea IS. 
While of course it's in everyones best interest to err on the side of caution, it still saddens me that people's lives get interrupted like this - it's like the terrorists are getting what they want.
Apparently they found something that "looked like a bomb or a very good fake" and detonated it. It contained wires, a mobile phone and some electronic circuits connected to each other. A police bomb dog also gave alarm when checking the package. 
Some passengers saw a suspicious man planting the package on the train. When passengers tried talking to him, the man fled.

Source is the BILD but they often have very good insider contacts.

EDIT: The part about the bomb parts got confirmed by other sources now. Looks like there was indeed something serious going on.

EDIT2: BILD provided pictures now of a bomb squad and the supposed package [1]. The detonation seems to be true too. Some pics: [[1]](http://puu.sh/lphxe/057f65b257.jpg)[[2]](http://puu.sh/lphBt/814a4ef29a.jpg)

EDIT3: No explosives. Apparently it was a fake after all. The train station is open again.

Cant wait for the Qatar World Cup now.
What's the point of a press conference if you're not going to give us any new information and just repeat the same political bs you've been telling us all weekend? "We don't want to upset our people" my ass, I'm upset because we *don't* know anything.
So far this ambulance-bomb thing hasn't been confirmed by a reliable source, lets not get too carried away.
[deleted]
Yeah, honestly as a thing I wouldn't want to mess with the Germans.  They seem like they're efficient, and dangerous when motivated to resolve problems
It sure seems like the point where aggravation and fear overtakes tolerance in regards to Muslims in Europe is fast approaching. More further right-wing parties are gaining more seats throughout European parliaments.
I'm in Hannover right now. Was at the central train station 5 minutes ago.

Things are quiet. Lots of police.

They have not found any explosives at the stadium (the ambulance was fake news). At the central train station there was a "suspicious" luggage piece in one of the ICE, ~~which is being examined right at this moment.~~

In the press conference of Thomas de Maizière it was said that there is information that will not be disclosed at this moment but is highly worrying.

The police posted on Facebook that there were no explosives found in the detonated luggage/package.

No info on whether it was just forgotten luggage or a dummy explosive.

Regarding our Non-German-Speaking-Friends, check out [DW](http://www.dw.com/en/hannover-bomb-threat-live-updates/a-18856763) (Deutsche Welle) for german news in 30 different languages. It's Germany's state run international broadcaster. 


Dear governments, please focus your rage on Saudi Arabia instead of arming them.  This ends with Saudi Arabia.

Someone translate pls
While its awesome that no explosives were found, the reports that came out due to a lack of info really spooked a lot of folks. 
It turns out they don't hate us for our freedom - they hate us for our football.
So... nothing actually happened, or was going to happen?
So it seems to be a false alarm as of now? Have to compliment them on their good precautions and speed though. Trains being stopped, game stopped before anything could possibly happen... This should NOT become a common thing though. It's only good security is prepared.
I'm going to say this, congratulations to the policing who found this out before any serious damage could be done before it is too late.

On another note, I live beside Wembley stadium(where France vs England) I've no idea how strong the security is tonight as I tried not to get caught up in the crowds when i leave my apartment but help me if there is, nothing has been said about any disturbances yet here...

but was Angela Merkel meant to be present at the match? 
I live in Braunschweig thats 40km away from hannover and i saw a huge ass police convoy driving to hannover when i came back from work.
I feel like German police always manages to prevent the worst.

Afaik nothing really bad happened due to IS in Germany so far.
paranoid times
I live about 15min foot walk next to the stadium and without the news i wouldn't even have realized what was going on.
The fans stayed insanely calm, no panic at all.
Holy fuck, that's my hometown. This feels so unreal. I know that nothing has been confirmed as of yet, but why would they target Hannover out of all places?
This is exactly how it felt for days when Mumbai got attacked by Pakistani terrorist and entire city was on alert for days and weeks, Mumbai has been attacked like this since 1993 and multiple times from pakistan. Europe and America dont care about this but now that its happening in  europe, i hope the attitude towards this terrorism changes and they are accompanied with some actions rather than words like "there there, you are third world country, deal with it"
Don't know if this will be seen by anyone, but let's remember that every brown guy walking down the street isn't a terrorist. After 9/11, there were plenty of innocent dudes beaten for no reason. Let's be reasonable. Keep your cool.
To me it doesn't really matter if it's a false alarm or not. Better safe than sorry in these kind of cases. 
Bomb threat against Paris hotel where the German team was staying...bombs at the stadium where they played...another bomb at the stadium they were supposed to play at...

I guess Daesh (or whatever we're calling ISIS today) really doesn't like Germany accepting so many refugees...
Silver lining - it seems like Reddit's fixed their algorithm.

i like dick so much. no one will ever see this comment. i love penis :)
And this tweet reached 8k of retweets: https://twitter.com/dw_sports/status/666698740108009472 Horrible journalism DW Sports. Shame on you.
Sounds like this is getting bigger. Press is saying a suspicious bag has been found, suspicious people were spotted, a concert hall being evacuation and the NDR apparently announced that there's a fill on threat for entire Hannover. Traintraffic has been stopped. 
This whole situation is getting out of control.  I really don't know what to say.  My fear is that if this continues, if there are more attacks, that Europe will become a series of police states and that people will gladly hand over their freedom for the illusion of safety.  It's happened before, please for the love of god don't let it happen again.
Started out innocently enough but some people claiming the entire city is in danger, while probably exaggerated to hell, is some serious shit. 

Regardless of the outcome many people don't want to go to a big event for a long time after this.
Turks disrespecting moment of silence for France during Turk-Greece match today. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epEXLOAjals
Not all of them are like that though.
Even if it's fake, we still live in fear. That's what they wanted.
Stay inside and stay safe people of Hanover.
Holy shit. Thank god our government was able to prevent this attack. 
Guardian is reporting that concert arena is being evacuated also. Thought Guardian was pretty reliable?
Between the stadium-bombing in Paris being minimized to one causality per three bombs, and the stadium-bombing in Hannover being averted, things could be a LOT worse. Hundreds more could have been dead.
Weird, but Der Spiegel and thelocal.de are both unavailable right now. Has this broke enough for there to be a crush of site hits? 
There's no confirmation for any of this other than a few tweeters right?
Someone please translate the live press conference as it is happening now. 
this evening there were serious leads to abort the match ger- ned.
it was cancelled late, because it took some time to get an overview over everything and evaluate the danger.
source of the tips and the specific threat will not be discussed, for safety reasons. they are all sorry that there is no football today ;)
rest is just blabla
 De Maiziere can't really say anything
Look no explosives but better be safe than sorry

Glad no one was hurt.
Twitter is a hot mess over this, with "reports" coming in every second stating that something was or wasn't found.

If this was a hoax, it's a given that it's in poor taste and really shows that people have to verify before trusting a "source".
Wait so... was there an actual threat or not? I'm so confused.
I don't know, if the world has to choose ISIS or Football, I think ISIS will have a hard time keeping on the ball.
Well that de-escalated quickly...

  I mean that in a good way! Put down your pitchforks!
Currently studying abroad in Berlin and am trying to stay updated on the news. I've been watching BBC and CNN and am still confused by all of the various sources of information. Was any sort of bomb found or is everything still speculation?  
Bet you 1 DM that this plot failed because of poor bomb-engineering skills, rather than due to being discovered through extreme invasive surveillance. 


Yeah, a DM is basically worthless.

But so is extreme invasive surveillance. 
Im already picturing what a shit show the 2016 Euro's will be...
so all of the fools on my facebook feed keep talking about an ambulance filled with explosives.  cannot substantiate this with any new site.  confirmation that these idiots are idiots?
Leave my team and my people alone you fucks.
I don't know who did this or why, but here's my uninformed opinion.
Man, this is straight up rome all over again. How will you stop barbarians within your own borders that look like normal citizins.
Why is there no story? They "story" is just them repeating the headline! I hate when they publish headlines with absolutely no content!
[deleted]
So, professional journalism just experienced what we did when we 'found' the Boston Marathon bombers!
How much will the peoples of Europe take?
Hanover's chief of police has just confirmed "There was a device intended to be detonated inside the stadium."

I love how these threads are always filled with Islam apologists. If this had been some Baptist who didn't want to give cupcakes at a gay wedding we would be calling for blood. Look, it's OK to criticize Islam. It doesn't make you a racist or a reactionary ethnocentrist.
I live in Hanover..
The area around the stadium is closed, as well parts of the main station! There was also a concert in the HDI arena in Hanover that got canceled and evacuated !

Police is in the whole town on tour with machine pistols .. Never thought to see this is my hometown :/
Hannover police is on it. Looking good eh?

Seems like police found a fake bomb in the IC train. Looks like nothing actually happened. gn8
Prey on people's fears much?  Someone could pop a paper bag and yell, "Boo!", and everyone will lose their minds.
It's pretty interesting how Germany is handling this. Here in the US the conspiracy theorists would be flipping the fuck out about "Marshall Law!" "False Flag!" "The CIA did this" "9/11, building 7, New World Order!" or some other bullshit.
sooo.. that's 10 minutes away from me. I'm a little shaky, but all my friends are ok and they stopped all the subways so we organized how they can get home. Some of my friends are in the University and they might just all stay there. I'm still nervous. Between where I live and the stadium is only the Maschsee.
Since there seems to be a lot of misinformation or rumors being taken as facts:

* TUI Arena, where a concert is currently taking place, has NOT been evacuated

* no major news outlet has confirmed the reports of an ambulance with explosives

* tubes and trains in Hanover are mostly operating as normal, with a few exceptions


More and more human rights are going to be taken away because of all this "fear". Europe should learn from the mistakes the U.S. made after 9/11.
If there is a genuine threat, this is the right thing to do but, we need to be careful not to change our lives in response to these attacks. Ultimately, while what happened is tragic, the threat isn't actually that severe. Out of millions and millions of people they could have attacked, 129 are dead. Compared to the populations of the metropolitan centres of Europe, this is a very small number. I, for one, would prefer to risk being attacked than live in fear of what is actually a pretty ineffective and cowardly enemy. 
This really, really worrying me. The amount of power these terrorists gained with this recent attack is gigantic. By way of threats alone they can exert control over the lives of thousands of people.
To lighten the mood: probably for the best for the Netherlands, avoiding a humiliating loss against Germany. 

Shame fear won tonight. I'd imagine you could find a suspicious package at any football match.
German police 1 -  terrorists 0.
islam, just like all religions, are a blight upon modern society
Oh for fucks sake. Cut it out ISIS
"Supicious package found at stadium" honestly fuck terrorism cancelling everything we love. People cant even enjoy a fuckin football match!!
Got no idea how valid his sources are. 

https://twitter.com/L0gg0l/status/666696004691955712
Apperantly an ambulance has been seen with explosives. Sick fucks!
Hanover police confirm Söhne Mannheims concert planned at TUI-Arena will go ahead as planned. #GERNED
In a few moments, police officials will held a press conference. Stream can be seen [here](http://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/buitenland/live-persconferentie-situatie-hannover).

Edit: Dutch newswebsite, stream is in German (television channel ZDF).

20:41 - pressconference not started yet, regular daily news is speaking about the threat though.
well done to the police over there, you saved hundreds of lives
Damn, it could be a ton of TNT in that bomb truck.
Wow, this is a tough situation, they apparently found a car bomb, but will they evacuate over all kinds of idiots legit or not threatening them?
Good work Germany!  Remain vigilant and wary.  
https://twitter.com/dw_sports/status/666711255432957953

Now part of their central train station has been closed off due to another unknown object :(
[Police evacuating part of Hanover central train station after discovering something suspicious](https://twitter.com/dw_sports/status/666711255432957953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
No further  statement about how they found out about it or who tipped them off, to keep tactics effective in the future.
the fcb players already flew home
Since when did ambiguity about the current threat level ever inspire no panic? Is it not better for the general public to be informed with succinct but precise information rather than speculating either too much or too little?
"Examining suspicious item near train station".
Going to work tomorrow will be fun. Paranoia, here I come!
I missed the press conference, is there somewhere I can still watch it?
BBC reporting no explosives found in stadium. were people attempting to bring it inside? 
Damn, November just doesn't wanna stop ramping it up huh?
Why? Germany did nothing wrong.
Was it ever confirmed if the ambulance had explosives or not?
Well...looks like this week is going to be nuts all around too...
Stay safe folks.  😞 
Fear archieved.
I am confused. Was there a bomb in the ambulance or not.
What is the latest ?
So I guess they dropped the plans to attack Russia next when they got white-hot hellfire dropped on them?
Hnnn
Given this is football, it's already life and death to a lot of the fans.  Terrorists only win when they disrupt what people care about.
Well.. That sure has to be enough for another airstrike!

Unfortunately, this is exactly what they want to happen.
The terror tactic really works :( 
[deleted]
Fuck me, I live in hannover.
Germany handled this like a boss.
I like how the headline is about the Stadium being evacuated and then in the video its like ~10seconds where they mention it...
Internet, stop trying to trick me!
I hope that nobody gets hurt, but I've never felt safer in my random American city.
people on twitter say it its because of a suspicious package found in the stadium..
took reddit quite a long time to have this on the front page
Even if this is not terrorist related, the terrorists are still winning. This is just showing that they have struck fear into the world. Still terrorizing.
Fuck. Fuck those terrorists. Fuck the politicians that try to gain an advantage by creating an atmosphere of fear. Fuck. Why can't everybody live in peace?
Stay strong Europe. Keep yourselves safe, but don't let them terrify you, and don't sacrifice your values. The terrorists really do win if you do. 
At some point Europe will get mad enough to solve the problem.  I hope so.
This is the perfect time for the world to come together and end this bullshit. We have a common enemy... let's, as ONE, go in and fuck em up. Then the major players in the world can set an example of what the world really needs to do. And that's come together to solve problems. I hope the world powers see this as an opertunity to unite us all against evil. Radicalist need to be killed. People shouldn't live in fear and out governments are the only ones who can stop them. The people need to support them and the other countries in this fight.
Welcome to Islam, where everyone has to live in fear
The thing is that they really wanted to make this game happen and if  they're cancelling it now this means that there was/is an imminent threat.  
I don't like this. I don't like this, at all.

I imagine we're going to hear about a *lot* of *planned* bombings being thwarted by the good-guy-government for the next few months. What's the next threat level? Panic?

Here come the sweeping new powers laws.
As a muslim, it makes me so fucking happy that these sicko terrorists were stopped before they harmed more innocent people. Fuck ISIS.
Everybody is safe! - edited
Be safe friends in Europe. 
According to Erdogan there is no oil trade, so Russia will just be bombing bad guys.

So Turkey has nothing to say about it.
Everyone here is saying fuck Erdogan, but this is going to hurt ISIS more which is awesome. ISIS relies on getting oil money now. If we can stop that flow of money they'll soon not be able to pay their soldiers or support them and will start collapsing from the inside. 
Of course it is. Whatever shady business Turkey had in Syria, direct or indirect, is now going to be a Russian bomb magnet.
As a Turkish citizen, I applaud these efforts, but I wish he did more to uncover the secret dealings the crooks here are up to their knees with. Erdogan can't jail Putin like he does innocent citizens and journalists..

Edit: Thank you for the gold! Finally I have something that Erdogan cannot steal. 
That hurt Turkey more than a ten fold revenge in air combat.
Cool. Now Russia got angry that Turkey downed their aircraft. So they're gonna include Turkey in the anti-ISIS campaigns.

Hope it helps. Black market money to IS ain't good, and Turkey being involved is disgraceful.
I like this. Fuck Erdogan
What's fucked up is that the US had to have known about this and we did nothing about it until Russia showed up and started blowing up the mile long oil transport trucking lanes. The first headline I saw about the US destroying these transportation vehicles was after Russia started their campaign. Something is fishy here. 
You know, for a country that is likely in bed with terrorists and knee deep in corruption, you'd think Turkey would have tried to avoid pissing off the one major superpower with an itchy trigger finger and a "don't give a fuck" attitude left.

But no, a minor airspace encroachment and they bomb their fucking plane, then talk shit. 
Now that's something I support Putin on!
Erdogan is the worst. It's amazing that America keeps turning a blind eye to all of his bullshit and what is now looking more and more like cahoots with ISIS (not to mention the gross mistreatment/borderline genocide of the Kurds). Seems like Putin is the only one with any balls here.
No ISIS oil. No Russian gas. No Tourism. No food trade with Russia.

This is going to become very interesting.
If you want to stop the flow of oil money, you are going to want to look south.... Way south 
[deleted]
Thank you Russia
HA GOOD! Fuck Erdogan
Well Turks are either way "denying" any wrong doings. So they shouldn't complain over ruined illegal business which they claim are not part of.
Playing with bears is dangerous. 
Now you fucked up erdogan, you disgusting pig, you are a shame to the turks.

Putin does not play
Can you imagine being one of the drivers of these trucks? 


Evil Oil Distributing ISIS guy:
"Hey, go drive this OIL to Turkey, Allahu Akbar"
Knowing damn well that you're going to get killed if you say no... but if you do it you're going to be killed by the Russians. 

Great job security I guess... but you might be forced into early retirement.
I applaud Russia for their lack of giving a shit about anything but destroying isis.
Erdogan saying that Assad buys oil from ISIS is the biggest bull I have heard 
Putin has this habit of being right for all the wrong reasons. You hate to agree with him, because you know he's playing chess, but he's right.
Good, cut off their money supply. 
ISIS is largely funded by wealthy Saudi's. The marjority of ISIS militants some areas of Syria are Saudi. Cutting their oil supply will probably put a dent on their resources but it certainly won't be enough to defeat them.
It's funny, because Erdoğan taunted prove it ([even though it's already kinda been established](http://www.businessinsider.com/links-between-turkey-and-isis-are-now-undeniable-2015-7)) and now Putin's going to prove it one bombed-out-wreck at a time.

There's a Russian saying: Where there's smoke, there's a bombed out oil truck that was headed for Turkey. 
Not to defend Putin or be pro violence , but yeah, f course he will bomb the oil routes.

I wish this was a strategy in the start no matter where the oil is going, but of course... Depends who your "ally" of the year is...
Good, cut the purse strings. Fuckin Turkey... are we allies with them because we need the airspace?
Is there no 'vote of no confidence' or 'impeachment' or something similar to try to get erdogan out of office?
Good. 
**шах и мат**
If the Turkish government cares so deeply about the black market oil trade that they are willing to down a Russian jet to protect it, why are they allowing their country to be used as one of the main bases to strike IS oil infrastructure in the first place?

This wasn't about oil but about protecting ethnic Turkish rebels in Syria. 

Edit - For more evidence, consider that Russian and coalition jets have not bombed a single piece of oil infrastructure anywhere near the Turkish border (within 100km) at any point in time in this conflict. Also remember that the vast majority of Russian strikes in Syria are focused on non-Daesh rebels.


finally
Turkey supports ISIS. Saudi Arabia supports ISIS. Only 30% of Pakistanis are opposed to ISIS. Look at how Islam behaves when it is in power. Islam is a cancer on humankind.
Isn't this the plot of "The World is Not Enough" ?
Hurting both Turkey and Daesh at the same time? I likey.
hit em in the pocketbook. Interesting article about DAESH funding here: [WAPO](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/18/how-isis-makes-its-money/)
What a coincidence 
As it should be.
Why the fuck was the US not doing any of this shit
Good, fuck 'em
I think he would do way more damage to Turkey by providing undenyable proof of them buying that oil instead of accusations and threats...
I wonder if Russia will start supporting an independent Kurdistan
This is a win no matter what. Whoever is buying the oil is gonna lose, and ISIS is going to lose. It's almost like Russia is actually helping instead of propping up Assad for once...
Russia hit a second convoy that was crossed directly into Al Qaeda held territory from Turkey.

https://twitter.com/michaelh992/status/670564603177365504
Oh wait, they just hurt Turkey in the deserts of western Iraq.
In October 2014 US Vice President Joe Biden told a Harvard gathering that Erdoğan’s regime was backing ISIS with “hundreds of millions of dollars and thousands of tons of weapons…”

The prime source of money feeding ISIS these days is sale of Iraqi oil from the Mosul region oilfields where they maintain a stronghold. The son of Erdoğan it seems is the man who makes the export sales of ISIS-controlled oil possible.

Bilal Erdoğan owns several maritime companies. He has allegedly signed contracts with European operating companies to carry Iraqi stolen oil to different Asian countries. The Turkish government buys Iraqi plundered oil which is being produced from the Iraqi seized oil wells. Bilal Erdoğan’s maritime companies own special wharves in Beirut and Ceyhan ports that are transporting ISIS’ smuggled crude oil in Japan-bound oil tankers.

Assad buying isis oil still ok. 
Great news today. First news this afternoon: Anti-Isis coalition air strikes explode 283 Isis oil trucks

and now Russia on the move. What a blow to ISIS. 

1. Start a proxy war with Russia and Enter Syria for oil and gold.

2. Train and arm ISIS.

3. Use ISIS to shit on the middle east (also shit on the kurds/ PKK for Turkeybro)

4. Get dat free ISIS oil through Turkey/ Saudi Arabia for the US.

5. Shit on Russia by butt fucking the oil price, I mean look at Russia's economy now, it's butt fucked.

6. FUCKING ERDOGAN CUNT FUCK WHY U GOTTA BLOW THEM PLANES UP YOU CUNT

7. FUCK CUNT BALLS Russia uses  jet incident as an excuse to bomb dat US oil in Syria (USA's homies)

8. ???

What's next?
I like the three Russia Today articles featured on the front page of World News. All targeting the west and her allies and praising the Russians and their allies. 

Surely there's no ulterior motive being pushed here. 
What if Russia was baiting Turkey with that plane to get more political leverage. That would have been genius

Don't mess with Putin man
Putin is merely trying to push oil prices higher- he needs the money.
This is getting good! :)
And now its finally said aloud why the west, USA, EU was turning blind eye to ISIS atrocities for all this time : Cheap oil , that ISIS sells for weapons and not money ( yes the western powers are selling them weapons , for oil )

When all this started, I was saying : "At first moment ISIS captures Oil rig, USA will descend upon them with all powers. But when this didnt happen, it was obvious to me that USA is getting something out of that. No modern power will silently watch their Oil rigs being occupied (heck they waged parts of WWII over such things).

I dont know if they buy Oil for weapons, but I am sure ISIS would agree to such deal. And pragmatic seller would do it (USA).

And I am sure its not done directly, but trough proxy (turkey). So dont expect "proof". But its obvious trough their inaction, and when forced to do action (after many atrocities and world outcry), why this action was inadequate and very limited.

Basically. Putin knows that with removing Oil from ISIS control, he will decapitate the beast, and piss off USA (no more cheap oil) in one stroke.

BTW, anyone wondered why the world OIL prices dropped so drastically last year ... ;|
I don't trust both Erdogan and Putin. Remember, not long ago, they were bff of each other.
I know that Erdogan helped ISIS before, he sent guns to eliminate YPG. During Gezi, he claimed his sisters(implying headscarfed women) was insulted by half naked leather gloved men. And those men pissed on them. Even a kid wouldn't believe such a horseshit.
Is Putin innocent? No. Remember things he did in Ukraine. Bombing civillian plane, causing masked pro-Russians take over, murdering of civillians etc.
They both use the same method to achieve their goals. Fear. Erdogan won the elections because he said if you want stability, you know what to do. Otherwise, things will be very different. He jails journalists because he doesn't want any opposing news or his dirty games revealed or  comments about him. It's a good way to threaten press. People are mostly cowards.
Rt news is a Russian state owned media outlet. Just saying
In reality, Russia keeps bombing western Turkey where ISIS is completely absent.
This is an article from russia today, damn it, nothing to talk about 
Seems legit.
It used to be critical of.
It's so hard to know who to cheer for these days.
Bomb ya 
2 birds with 1 stone huh?

I would make popcorn, but "good" is not what this about to get...
Then turkey will 'accidentally' shoot down more russian jets.
Well, here comes another country torn to pieces, just like Syria, just like Iraq.
Does Bilal know about this?
As President he can manipulate these people on a great way to the presser.
I hope Erdogan doesnt escalate the matter further, the West is committed in stopping ISIS, why cant the middle east do the same? Oh right for the $$. Turkey should revolt against him to stop his suicidal spree 
SHOULD be a priority for both turkey and US, but why split hairs?  A few convoys deliberately left alone doesnt imply aiding the enemy..
Whoa this is about oil?! WHY DIDN'T ANYONE TELL us oh right we knew that already.
This is old news and just shows how Erdogan successfully manipulated the western countries into not disrupting his dirty deals with IS. Putin is an authoritarian prick just like Erdogan but the inability of the democratic world in dealing with IS has let him have the moral high ground. His Syrian adventure is an absolute PR coup if not at home but all across the western world. 
No respect for Putin until he puts his ground troops where his mouth is.
I'm OK with this 
checkmate :)
Blow dat ish-ish up!
So buying oil will literally support terrorists?
Good news. 
Soooooo we know that Turkey is buying oil from ISIS... which means they are funding ISIS, yet nobody is doing anything about it? apart from these strikes via Russia. i mean, could someone explain this to me... shouldn't this be a global crime, and shouldn't NATO be doing something
A few years back some beef was tested in the US and the test showed mad cow disease. The US FDA was able t trace the cow's origin to a farm in Canada.

Now, does anybody believe the US had no knowledge of mile long truck convoys between ISIS controlled oil refineries and Turkey?


Of course it's a resource war 
Y-yay? 
The whole business is quite funny for us than wartime economy.
Putin's going to have so much fun with this. And Erdogan's just going to have to shut up and watch.
well that will definitely piss him off if that's what he wants..
finally
I'm so confused on what's Turkey's play here is. Turkey would never engage in direct warfare with Russia, nor would NATO step in if anything happened since this whole situation and response is Turk's fault.

Love the new gen politics though. Let's see if Putin can turn Russia's economical situation around. The West needs a strong ally and can't afford to have China and India be the next sole super powers.
There's a reason you don't fuck with wasp nests.
In my opinion which is only going from the headlines since russia started helping assad, Russia has been targeting oil tankers and disrupting the oil supply from isis to turkey and that is why they shot down the jet. A warning that has backfired badly for turkey, but which in my  mind is very good, Putin is no fool it seems he has some very good tacticians helping him plan some great moves recently.
WWIII
Turkeys islamists are going to drag down the country into chaos soon. 
Good on ya Russia! blood oil is damnable by hellfire.
Dayumm

So how come the US has not been doing this? Surely if they wanted to stop ISIS they would cripple them financially by bombing all oil fields and power plants?
The more Erdogan talks.
Every bomb they drop decreases cut rate black market oil trade that they are doing this instead of any sort of direct violent conflict or political action.
Oil going up
Erdogan will be running a Geiger counter over everything he eats for the rest of his short life.
Fucking smart. Since Turkey is doing this, for sure, and it is illegal, they can't say shit, but Putin is still giving Turkey a giant fuck you. Well deserved as well.
For Russia to move its black sea fleet it has to pass through Turkish waters this has been simmering for a long time !
So Russia bomb g isis because it effects there oil and gas exports?
Clever. It'll be hard for turkey to complain about it.
isn't this why US went to Iraq to secure oil? seams like history is repeating itself here but now with russia 
Time is a cancer on humankind. finally Not to defend our NATO ally against Russia who again is fighting ISIS, but we are poisoned by Russian propoganda and that Turkey downed their aircraft.
People are caught up in some emotional barbaric response like Reddistan would have been in Turkish airspace, but the people who voted for him.
He finally has someone to fuck with that plane to get comfortable there.
My popcorn tastes like a good move on Russia's part. let's bomb anything ISIS, period.
How long have the US been bombing Syria? Why did it take the Russians to do it? Why so long? I would assume it would be a priority.
Oh but wait, Turkey still controls lots of money they'll soon not be able to keep the perpetual War on Drugs money train a'chuggin.
Sounds like a fair plan to me. If Turkey has nothing to do with the oil, it won't be too bad for them.
You see, this is where I actually admire Putin a little bit. The guy is smart like a fucking fox, I mean, what can Turkey say about it? Nothing, they just get fucked. Which they should have been in the first place, I mean what would NATO say if they knew about open support for ISIS? Let's see, France might just have a problem with that. 
this should have been done earlier !
The oil smugglers about to get a gift of a package of stinger missiles. It's communist hunting season. 
Is he going to bomb oil smuggling to Assad as well or is he going to leave th3se supply lines intact...?
Hasn't the U.S. been doing this for a while?


Whats taken Russia so long to get on board?
This should be interesting because what if there are Turkish citizens or even military personnel involved in these oil transport convoys?
Turkey is required to notify the families of the deaths (or maybe it won't) but it would have no justification for starting a war with Russia over it. The plot thickens. 
So THAT'S why Obama kept funding and arming all those Turkish-backed 'moderate' rebels while claiming the US wants to fight radical Islamists.
&gt;Putin stated that sales of oil from ISIS are in direct violation of international law

So what was that thing Putin did with Crimea per international law?

It's pretty clear Russia is taking advantage of the situation in Syria for two purposes. One, to protect and expand their influence in the region. Two, to deflect attention from what they've been doing with Ukraine and Crimea. 

At least they're aligning closer to coalition objectives and hitting ISIS a little more often seeing as they've been a bit focused on the anti-Assad rebels. Of course current events, including this decision, is probably not going to decrease the tension in the region in the long-run. Things are getting worse and they're getting more complicated...
so this is real news? So RT is considered a credible source?

I mean, I guess Putin saying it means he said it, regardless of the source. But, I mean, it's not like I watch Fox News...
This is literally Reddit:

-Putin is the man of the year! He defused the Syrian sarin and chemical gas crisis! Yay Putin!

-Putin is Hitler he annexed crimea and he's coming for Europe!

-Putin is bombing moderate rebels what a savage! He caused Syrian crisis by supporting Assad

-Putin is a hero! He's sole handedly fighting ISIS and exposing Turkey for directly supporting ISIS and the West for pretending to fight ISIS and arming savages. There are no moderates!

So is he a friggen super villian or an agent of truth?
Make up your mind folks of Reddit!
If people here really believe this will hurt Turkish economy, i don't know what to say.
Estimates:
http://www.cnbc.com/2015/11/19/isis-oil-revenue-damaged-by-airstrikes-low-price.html
At the peak, ISIS had about 100,000-110,000 barrels a day under control but this was back in the summer of 2014. Now, and with particularly all the airstrikes, it's less than 50,000 barrels per day – we think that it's about 40,000 per day.
40.000 per day, lets say it's $30 for one barrel, it's about 400 million dollar per year. So, Turkey buys $10 cheaper from ISIS, so it's about 150 million dollar profit per year for Turkey. It is if we say Turkey buys all of the oil from ISIS.
And people really think Turkey is working with ISIS for fucking 200 million dollars. Makes sense.
So, before trying to talk smart do your homework.
Wasn't RT banned? 
My god I'm loving this. Both Putin and Erdogan are such giant dickholes; watching them fuck with each other is pure entertainment.
So from villian to superhero - Putin is the old one speaking the truth
Will this make gas in the US go up?
Erdogan to NATO: ARTICLE 5 ARTICLE 5!!!!!

NATO:....WHA? PASS DA PIE? 
[Will Putin stop the Syrian regime from buying oil from ISIS as well or do they get a pass on trade with terrorist organizations?](http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-says-syria-is-buying-oil-from-islamic-state-1448471418)
So maybe it's time to declare war on Saudi Arabia. 
The russians already killed 7 turkish smugglers in a bombing raid and Turkey can't even complain, because the bastards were carrying guns to ISIS.
Republicans like to think Reagan brought the USSR to it knees. But it's Obama who'll be remembered as destroying its remnants. By washing his hands of Syria, he passively goaded Putin to take up arms. Obama gambled that something like this would happen. A war (even a small one) between Turkey and Russia will be a huge win for the US (and Obama). 

I loathed Reagan and the Bush clan. But Obama is the true evil genius. And almost nobody gets it. Not Democrats. And certainly not republicans who, if they stopped and looked, would find their natural leader.

Expect a damning event or report from the US regarding Russia's move very shortly. We are likely to hear reports of civilian casualties or attack on NATO operations. Just watch.
Russia not bombing ISIS, They bombing Rebels in syria 
İts funny because in Ukraine Russia support Rebels...
Just look at the Russia Bombing map in Syria...
.
And ISIS did two terrorist attack in Turkey last mounths 200 turkish people died. Of course France people much more important..


50 comments on world news and no mention of RT? That's not normal.
[deleted]
Here comes the BOOM!
RT=Russia Today

How about the dealings between the Assad regime and the ISIS? Why not start from there?  How is Putin any better than all the despots before him? Just because Turkey showed him what a spine looks doesn't mean he'll create contexts out of thin air to make his air campaign look honourable. Why isn't anyone talking about the percentage of Russian bombings against the Rebels vs the ISIS? Reddit so much hates Erdogan that right after his legitimate electoral victory with nearly 50% of the vote, they called it a "victory of the fascists." Is there anyone who has actual proof, not Daniel Pipes' ramblings, about the Turkish support of ISIS on an organisational level? 
Good. The untold motive behind all of this unrest is oil. I'm happy to see a leader of a country stepping up to somewhat address that.
A few strafing runs from an A-10 Warthog would put a big dent in that convoy.

The fact they are operating in a closely spaced lne shows they either think they are safe or they are stupid.

They have shown us they are not stupid.
The atheist CIA is fucked.

Crazy if this was all just a conspiracy set up to stop anyone believing Turkey is allowing ISIS to sell/transport oil and Putin really isn't doing anyth
[deleted]
Ok, I'm out. I can't take the Russian propaganda anymore.

Any suggestions on subreddits I can replace r/worldnews with when I unsubscribe?

Thanks!
The more infrastructure that gets destroyed the harder it is going to be to effectively govern that area.  Amazing how oil extraction is a target now but the second the area is conquered the first priority will be building and protecting them.  I think it might be a tactical victory while being a long-term strategic set-back.
Suddenly, reddit forgot about Putin's crimes. I say fuck'em both. *Let them fight*
So you are believing a country that is **ally with USA** who [host 60-70 USA nuclear bombs](http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/turkey/) is buying ISIS oil as a country? Who says? Putin.. Who is basically in war against people who got USA support in Syria. 

Ok.
And the fact that Russia wants cash and currently supplies 55% of Turkey's natural gas and 30% of their oil - I'll sure that's had no effect on Russia's decision *at all*.

(To be clear, I don't think Turkey should be buying gas from Daesh, but for Russia to act like they're only doing this to go after Daesh is untrue.  Russia is still hurting from sanctions and wants that money.)
Russia should apply the same standard on terrorists in Donbas and Lygansk taken to UKRAINE.
The recent jet incident lends a lot of people anxious and Erdogan fed those fears for political gains.
Can we just shoot tires so gasoline won't go crazy again

In other news, Putin kicked a tree in half on his way to the presser.
Brace yourselves for gas price hikes. You've been warned...
Isn't this was entire NATO and USA should be doing it in first place? Is Russia carrying entire world's weight about fight against ISIS? 
Good.
Does that mean the price of oil is gonna go up? I stocked up hard back in late August. 
Sounds like the beginning of world war 3.
Good...Good...let the hate FLOW through you!
I wonder if Russia vs. Turkey is going to be anything like Rousey vs. Holm.
Good. Turkey is just as much a tyrant as ISIS. If the U.S. weren't such close allies with Turkey, we'd be all over that shit too.
Erdogan denies Turkey buys any [oil from Islamic State](http://www.regionalposts.com/index.php/2015/11/28/erdogan-denies-turkey-buys-any-oil-from-islamic-state/) Turkish F-16 jets shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border on Tuesday, prompting a tough response from Moscow, a major trade partner of Ankara.
Sure, it may or may not have been genius finally Assad buying isis oil still ok.
Who drives the trucks? I doubt fighters do. Probably civilians trying to eek out a living.
**You mean like the other Allies have been doing hundreds of times in the last month?**


Too late, USA already took out their trucks. 

For the downvoters:

I really think title should be "anti ISIS" and not anti ISIS
Translation:  We are mad at Turkey for shooting jet down, so we are using this as a reason to strike targets inside Turkey borders.
Oh so you mean there's more to the story than "IZLAMIC HITLER TURKEY LOVES ISIS ASSHOLE. GO SCIENCE"
This is how you stop terrorism, take notes everyone. Russians pudding is employing a very strong strategy. When their oil supply runs out (runs dry) next Thanksgiving, the Turkey's will have to fly north. Daesh is finished. 
Looks like someone poked the bear tsk tsk
Let putin not forget striking isis oil convoys to his boy in damascus.
Russia is the Shit ☺
Is there some cynical empire-building reason for Russia's military action? Or is Putin just being a bamf for the sake of the civilized world?   

I'm real ignorant about this stuff.
The racism in this thread is on a whole different level than my imagination could've expected.

Epic reddit naivety. Russia isn't focused on stopping ISIS, they are focused on working with Assad and influencing the middle east.
Russia is tired of playing politics and just going for it. 
RT is a freaking propaganda channel, do you really want to get news from it?
Putin talks like ignorant man...Smuggling is the one of the biggest problems in my country...It isn't about isis or Essad...And not only oil...cigaratte, phone ext...they sell them in Turkey without taxes...Now Putin shows us the smuggler's trucks...
IF India declared emergency everytime there was a powercut, we would be in a permanent state of emergency
&gt;Electricity supplies from Ukraine to Crimea have been entirely shut off after the region's two remaining power pylons were blown up.

Apparently they need more pylons.  
Remember when you used to be able to come on to Reddit for an actual discussion of what was going on? Now all we get are shit jokes and puns.
It's been almost two years and they still hadn't set up an a power source from Russia? Topkek. Why the dick was Ukraine even supplying them still?
This week, on another exciting episode of European Collapse:

* Arab coughs loudly in a Belgian cafe, mistaken for gunshots!
* Secession moves forward: will the Catlans say adios to Spain, or will the pain in Spain stay mainly contained?
* Volkswagen tries to pad their losses from the emissions scandal by hiring Syrian refugees at their Dresden plant, but faces a hilarious blockade by Pegida!
* Greece still exists, and it's still fucked!
* Ireland says yes to gay marriage, "If we don't, the terrorists win! ... We mean the IRA terrorists, of course."
* Russia is Putin ISIS in its place; will Hollande kiss and make up?
* And finally, in the *electrifying* cliffhanger to this week's episode: Deadbeat dad Ukraine refuses to pay child support to little crybaby Crimea! Mother Russia says, "Oh nyet, he didn't!"

Will Europe survive another tumultous week? Tune in next week to find out!

EDIT: Thanks for the gold and karma, everyone! I'll definitely do this next Sunday!
Now watch other commodities from Russia to Ukraine being cut off.
Were Crimeans paying Ukraine for the electricity?
I highly doubt this was  a deliberate attempt by the Ukrainian government (masked or such). Much likely just some radicals trying to destabilize the situation even further.
But we (everyone except /u/uademnus) like Russia this week so like, Yay Putin.
And at the start of winter, too.

Things are gonna get rough.
Sad to see the top 500 comments are all gaming jokes, puns, or political patter.  Not one comment sympathizing with the many affected people, most of whom are just innocent people suffering terrible consequences.  

Most of us reading and chattering would consider a laggy wifi to be a big headache, never mind the prospect of weeks or months without power, refrigeration, light, heat, convenience or entertainment.

I'm visiting Crimea right now, in Simferopol (300k people, capital) at the moment. My hostel and most businesses in the central area of Simferopol seem to have power, was around town this evening and only noticed street lights were out. A super market I visted had their refrigerators all running, super bright lights are all still on, and I'm clearly here online after a hot (electric) shower. For what it's worth, locals aren't grumbling and nothing political is being discussed, I've asked a shop owner and my hostel owner about it and they just shrug.
Ukraine is becoming the wild west. A lot of people with no relation to the government have an arms, bombs etc. They may close the roads, they may cut the electricity, they are pretty free in doing anything they want and government can't do anything with them.
Crimea River.
In summer Ukraine was trying to create a drought in Crimea by building a dam on the North Crimean Canal (up to 85 percent of the peninsula’s water needs).

Now electricity. Is it a sophisticated Ukrainian plan to convince crimeans get back? 
so how likely is it that these attacks were carried out by Right Sector?

I thought the whole conflict was pretty much frozen right now.
Crimea river.

Edit: Reddit hivemind is stronger than I thought. Here I was being a douchebag and thinking "I'll make an original, witty joke!", and turns out there's already a dozen or more posts exactly the same as mine.
Lucky Ukraine doesn't rely on Russia for IT'S energy supplies. Oh wait...
"It was not clear who carried out the attack but several pictures of the damage showed Ukrainian flags attacked to the wrecked pylons"
Why not just tie a camel to the pylons and leave some sand and sandals scattered about, and then blame Daesh.......
Either some bad maintenance... or a terrorist attack... assuming this is real.
this is called terrorism, of course westerners like it and call it something else because the victims are russian
They probably used encryption to blow it up. /s
They have stepped up their campaign but the international community still considers it a sophisticated Ukrainian plan to convince crimeans get back? convince crimeans get back?
Damn.

As if living in Crimea couldn't get any worse. 
They could hook up one or two of the warship engines and run the critical infrastructure from them. 
Well atleast these guys got something else to think now than turning into radical islam! (Sorry tasteless joke)
So I guess you could say that there's currently a power vacuum.
How did they lose it? Does Crimea remember where it saw its electricity last? On a serious note, cutting power a week before December is a douche move. I hope Russia doesn't stoop to their level and cut gas to Ukraine.
Ukraine depends on the Russian occupied Donbass for coal to fire their own power plants.

so Ukraine has to ask Russia for Coal, and Ukraine was supplying power to Crimea, in a sort of quid pro quo.

I assume Russia will halt coal deliveries to Ukraine, which will cause the same sort of power shortages in (currently) unoccupied Ukraine.
How is their stupidly hot attorney general supposed to get her work done without power?
Just when you think Ukraine already hit the bottom.

They must construct additional pylons.
"It was not clear who carried out the attack but several pictures of the damage showed Ukrainian flags attacked to the wrecked pylons."

Really ATTACKED to the pylons, lol Do they not proofread?
Could be Ukraine is testing Russia to see how badly they've over-extended themselves in Syria.
Remember Ukraine was the oppressor here not Russia. This started because locals wanted to secede and join Russia.
Crimea river.
Obligatory "you must construct additional pylons"
Why does Ukraine have to supply Crimea anything? They wanted to join the Russians so fuck them imo
BUT RUSSIA GAVE FRANCE A PUPPY. 
.... Anyone thinking this could also be Russia purposely fomenting unrest by cutting electricity and making it look like Ukraine had forsaken Crimea. Then mother Russia steps in and makes it all better, and the Crimean people will not want to work at returning to Ukraine and be ok with Russia. 
When it talks about pylons, it doesn't mean [these things](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=pilon&amp;rlz=1C1CHWA_enGB653GB654&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=677&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwigzqPKk6TJAhWCbhoKHRsjC8AQ_AUIBigB#tbm=isch&amp;q=electricity+pylons) right? If it does, what's the fuss about, surely those can be replaced fairly easily?
Can someone eli5 what the situation in Ukraine, Crimea and Russia is? Haven't heard anything for a good long while about this...
This is exactly like Tom Clancy's *Red Storm Rising*. Dude can predict the future
Some of the country.
So, who blew up the pylons and "why?"

Ukraine could have cut off the electricity without blowing anything up - likewise Russia could have simply  ordered Crimea to not accept Ukrainian electricity.


Gotta wonder what the motive was.
Ukrainian police is actually trying to get the Tatar protestors away. So all of you thinking that Ukrainian government did this to punish Crimea... That's not very logical.

http://uatoday.tv/society/ukrainian-riot-police-violenty-break-up-crimean-tatars-anti-russia-blockade-538998.html
Its great to see this as Ukraine doing what's right but if you were Crimea and wanted to stay Rus wouldn't it make more sense this was best for you? Power can be produced locally. As soon as you do that the whole business about being part of Ukraine ends with a period.
Better invade more of Ukraine to properly build power lines! /s
ITT: Everyone ignoring the fact that just months ago we were all condemning Putin for the events happening in the Ukraine.

But that's none of my business. 

Looks like Russia is yet again profiting from a global incident to carry out its own agenda...
convenient...
Oh, look at that, it looks like some extremists blow up vital infrastructure to harm Russian citizens.
It also looks like Ukraine is incapable of protecting that vital infrastructure.
Let's see how Russia reacts.
Actually, this is an act of terror. Terrorism. I just see how, say, a hospital is cut out, while there is still some emergency surgery being done and/or some toddlers are in ICU connected to life support systems. Then I read all those comment on "Ha-ha, Crimea is Russia, why Russia won't do something about it" and feel nothing but rage to Ukranians. So, that's how you prove your righteousness, my Ukranian non-brothers-anymore?
Ukraine should also seal the border. After all, Crimeans wanted independence from Ukraine and, presumably, its utilities. Russia should supply them. 
&gt; state of emergency as Crimea loses electricity.

That's like saying "state of emergency as Paris loses citizens". It was terrorist attack on the infrastructure.
O believe me /u/bozmonster, poor, sorry and hateful [fellows](Please-russia-why-wont-you-just-die-russia-NYET.jpg), like /u/nukeyocouch and /u/Postius make me laugh so hard, I could write a script for them.

In the beginning, ***&lt;some of them might have feigned concern for the Crimeans, mixed with ridicule, and be like...&gt;***

&gt;Guise! Guise! Listen. The Crimean referendum was illegitimate, it's fake!! I actually believe..,no not believe nut I KNOW BETTER than the Crimeans that in their heart of hearts they never wanted to reunite with Mordor, I mean Russia. The Dark Lord Putin with his "*Polite*" little green men were present, they forced and intimidated the poor scared Crimeans into 'voting' against their will. 'Voting', *wink *wink. Get it? :P 97.47% Come on, who believes that crap! Amirite guise?

*I don't know man, judging by the [Crimean referendum of 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_referendum,_1994) they don't seem to really like being under the rule of Ukraine...*

***&lt;smug superiority, ridicule..&gt;***
&gt;Listen here you ignorant kid, Are you 12? or should I call you Ivan/Boris/Vlad? Stop watching RT. M-kay? 

&gt;No matter what they show you about life in Crimea it's untrue. **I have never seen, nor will I ever see**, convincing evidence from Western media that they are truly happy. Never mind the fact that Western media/politicians are prohibited from covering/experiencing the situation in the peninsula to have an honest objective assessment for fear of sanctions by Western governments if they did try. Anyway, even if they are happy they are still brainwashed. 

&gt;Should the previous scenarios be untrue(notice me not admitting that they are untrue) then whatever, the results of those referendums, nothing about them truly really matter because according to my infallible and thoroughly deeply accurate knowledge of International Law it is illegitimate. And before you begin with your *Whataboutism* about Kosovo, I want you to stop right now because I have already predicted your predictable response. There is absolutely nothing we can do about the past what must be done however is to apply international law in this specific situation, I mean always from now on, I mean whenever we can.  To reiterate it was clearly without an iota of doubt, no if's, no doubts, I-L-L-E-G-I-T-I-M-A-T-E. TL;DR Trust me, I know these things. I'm smart. You're not.

*Okay, but doesn't a successful coup aka revolution mean that the government in Ukraine no longer represents the people, the fact that any Constitution
 prohibits the changing of governments extrajudicially or outside of an official election means that the Constitution was, then and there, rendered null and void? If the people of Maidan didn't want to be ruled under Yanukovich then what of the wishes of the rest(eg Donbass, Crimea, Transcarpathia, Odessa) who would still prefer Yanuk over the new order in Kiev? Also there are reports that Neo nazis have taken considerable power in Ukraine like one of them taking the Head of Security,etc, it's an important and powerful office you know, especially when the sector who holds it doesn't even represent more than 5% of votes. Their historical experiences tell them to be wary of these guys marching with Wolfsangels banners, images of Bandera, the Nazi collaborator who murdered lots of ethnic Russians, Jews and Poles. These scenes scare and infuriate a lot of people there, their relatives were murdered after all, painful memories are still fresh and the least the new government could do was assure them, but failed to, was to condemn these nasty elements but it didn't*

In Simcity 4, half of the time I was constructing pylons between my towns and cities.
Ahh so that was the reason Putin was kissin Frace's ass so hard
You must construct additional pylons
Finally, something which isn't on ISIS.
You would think with the shit with Daesh going on,  these two would stop their fighting and focus on the larger problem..... And... Rip me apart for that.. Go! 
The worst thing about losing electricity is that you then have to look for it in the dark.

Time to build your own nuclear power plan right there, stop depending on Ukraine, you're not Ukrainian anymore. You voted out and succeeded, now, ask Mother Russia for help. 

Just a little price of being renegade, the nationalist should have done this  long ago lol.
Well, thankfully once the Russians took over they began the work of improving infrastructure so things like this wouldn't happen.

Just Kidding
Putin's plan:

1) Bomb ISIS and give France a puppy to build good will in the West.

2) False flag operation to give Russia an excuse.

3) ???, but I'm sure it will be a threat to what's left of Ukraine's territorial sovereignty.

You'd expect this from a Swede, but certainly not a Ukrainian.
Wasn't Russia charging in absurd amount of money for electricity once they took over Crimea?
We should send Russia a few of these.

Crimea River. 
Winter is coming!
Ukraine should decide once and for all already whether Crimea is Ukrainian or Russian. If it's the former, then what's the point in shutting down water supply/electricity to your own citizens? If the latter.. that still makes them look like dicks.
I guess you could say they need to [construct additional pylons!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4Ox2t5c4As)
"It was not clear who carried out the attack but several pictures of the damage showed Ukrainian flags attached to the wrecked pylons."

So we know the perpetrators were not Ukrainian then...
Well maybe next time Russia invades a country, it should make sure there's an alternate power generator, in case the invaded country gets mad.
Oh so Russia takes Crimea and they wanted Ukraine to pay for their power? 
Glad to hear. I'm still mad we let Russia take part of Crimea.

We made a deal with Ukraine to defend them. When the Soviet Union fell they had the second largest stockpile of Nukes only behind Russia themselves. We made a deal if they would dismantle them we would defend them from any threats.

We lied. Witnessing this makes me not want to blame any other nation for creating nukes and refusing to keep them. If Ukraine kept their nukes rather than making a deal with us Russia never would have invaded due to a fear of nuclear war.

I really hope Japan realizes what I did and develops nukes. If Russia or China ever attacks them I have no doubt we will do nothing but whine at the UN.

Construct more pylons. Insufficient vespene gas.
I'm going to go ahead and point out that it's probably not a coincidence that Russia is on the front page for their help in Syria and their actions in Crimea at the same time...
WE NEED MORE PYLONS. STAT.
I know people are speculating but this isn't intentional in anyway. Ukraine wouldn't just turn off or sabatoge the power because Russia would turn off the gas. Doing it right now would be suicidal 
look, you bunch of Morons. if you lay claim to land, you have to provide for it. like in Cyprus, they do the same shit and always have. if you cut the power off land you claim is in your country, you have literally cut power from your own people. if you supply it, you retain your claim.

this is like the most basic thing about geopolitics this is the first rule
Do people not remember that Russia starved to death 1,500,000 Ukrainians in the 1930's. Fucker that he was. We should help these people. We have the means and the resolve.
Get fucked Crimea. You voted to be part of Russia, well here you go. 
That's the problem with taking over part of a country that rely on supplies from that country, lol
Crimea a river.
*Construct more pylons!*
hahahah enjoy putin
Either Russia or Ukraine needs to do something about this immediately, winter there is harsh as fuck and I really don't care how this gets fixed.
I love how Russia annexed it, then when the Ukraine cut utilities they called it "inhumane" (or something similar). If you want to consider it as part of your country, you take care of it.

Russia should be stepping in and providing support. the Ukraine should cut them loose completely.
Damn.

As if living in Crimea couldn't get any worse. 
This must be a hoax, since everyone knows Russia is Zerg. 
It must have been aborted pylon rush by the Germans.

I bet Putin did this, as an excuse to invade Ukraine, to "rescue fellow Russians lacking heat"

Maybe they should go Crimea River. You know...build a hydro-electric dam on the principle waterway of the region...

My life for Putin
It's almost winter. let's see what happens when countries invade Ukraine in the winter time. ULTIMATE KEK 
NATO keeps pushing towards Russia. One day Iran and Syria will join Russia, then Syria will become the territory of Russia and Russian troops will kick all the invaders out of Syria.
If only we'd built the region with one more pylon. WHEN WILL WE LEARN???
You must construct additional pylons.
time for a little TURKISH POWER!http://mybroadband.co.za/news/energy/123770-secret-power-ship-plan-from-eskom-chair.html
Weak like Crimea.
Now the question is: will Russia drop the act and invade to secure a critical naval port, drop the act and threaten Ukraine to supply power or they'll turn off natural gas to the whole country, or will they try to get the Western Europeans to get Ukraine to turn Crimea's power back on, effectively dividing NATO in two and proving that its no longer a coherent alliance.
I hope the Ukrainians don't restore the power. At this point, I think it's time they (and the international community) decide to make life difficult there until Russia decides to hand Crimea over. Ukraine should use all the leverage it can against Russia on this issue.

Add in a naval and air blockade (with help from NATO) and Russia won't be able to get anything in.
Any chance this is an attack by ISIS? They did promise to attack Russia recently, so might have thought about going after some low hanging fruit. Maybe try to get Russia to use more of their resources in Ukraine, and try to get them to over extend. 

I seem to recall that there is a bit of sea traffic between Crimea and Syria as part of the Russian logistical network. 
Shoddy infrastructure with a war.

&gt;Nahdlatul Ulama, or NU, is the largest independent Islamic organization in the world, with 50 million members. Part Sunni religious body, part political party and part charity, it was founded nearly 90 years ago, in 1926, as a response to another Sunni movement, Wahabbism.  

&gt;Wahhabism is the ultra-conservative reform movement based in Saudi Arabia that advocates for puritanical laws from the time of Islam's origins. It rejects the modern notion of "religion as a purely private activity" and the separation of church and state. The Islamic State is highly committed to Wahhabi principles, using its religious textbooks and embracing its hardline tradition of killing unbelievers. 

Nice. 

Although simply wanting a caliphate =/= Wahhabism. The Ottomans fought against Wahhabism, squashed its uprisings, and considered the ideology to be outside the fold of Sunni Islam. That is, until they collapsed (due to decline, internal conflict, the Saudis, the Arab revolt) and the Sauds came to power with the help of Western backing.
As an Indonesian myself I can attest that NU is the most moderate Muslim organisation out there, they always promote interfaith peace, tolerance and harmony. They even go extra mile to protect churches during Christmas services since there had been bomb threats. Their clerics always speak of peace and do good unto others, in contrast to hate mongering Wahhabi clerics. And mind you this testimonial is coming from a non religious person.



And for sarcastic people who said this is way too late, or more specifically 14 - 15 years too late, please do realise that the world doesn't necessarily revolve around your country. We do sympathise with all tragedies to humanity all around the world, but it doesn't mean we have to cater to your own standards and liking. While it seems to be too late, please bear in mind that NU and other moderates in Indonesia have been promoting peace domestically since 1920s. Since 9/11 there have been lots of interfaith campaign and dialogue all across the nation. NU takes so long to escalate to international stage because it's not easy to mobilise such a huge organisation. We already have so much in our own hand because extremists are slowly growing in our nation, so please refrain from your generalisations if you aren't fully aware of the geopolitics and history of our country.

EDIT: spelling mistakes
NU original objective was to protect the syncreatic Islam found on Java.  its original aim was more mundane.  Prior to 1910s. most Muslims on Java were a Javanese form of Islam which incorporated Hinduism, animism and Buddhism.  Once aspect was the giving of alms (money) to get blessings.

In the 1910s, a new organization called Muhammadiyah that argued for a more orthodox approach to Islam, people should read the Koran for themselves instead of relying on Kyai (teachers that NU followers use to instruct them about the Koran), and attacked the notion of blessing for money.  Muhammadiyah is like the mainstream Islam you find in places like Jordan.



I hope this gets on the front page of this sub.
Tons of people have asked the Muslim world to stand up against ISIS, but no one ever acknowledges it when it does.
Quite sad.

Note: I know that a vast majority of muslims show their disgust and disapproval of ISIS every day but what people need to see is a huge scale movement and not just individuals on Facebook.
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/indonesian-muslims-counter-isis_565c737ae4b072e9d1c26bda) reduced by 87%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; Each time the Islamic State, al Qaeda or another terrorist group commits violence in the name of Islam, a familiar refrain arises: What&amp;#039;s the Muslim world doing about it?

&gt; Anti-extremism efforts abound in the global Muslim community: Muslim leaders and scholars have denounced the Islamic State group, the U.K.&amp;#039;s Muslim Youth League has declared &amp;quot;Ideological holy war&amp;quot; against extremism, and YouTube has even tried to recruit American Muslims to counter extremist content.

&gt; On Nov. 14, the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country&amp;#039;s top Muslim clerical body, which includes NU, announced a plan to mobilize 50,000 preachers to spread moderate, or &amp;quot;Wasathiyah,&amp;quot; Islam within Indonesia.

I'm going to assume that believing that apostates and adulterers should be killed is not considered extreme.
If you think that death punishment is ok for:

- Mocking Quran or Muhammad 

- Being gay

- Committing adultery

- Being an atheist
 
And pretty much any sin, you're an extremist and not a moderate Muslim, and you're a part of the problem that eventually creates Muslims who act on their extremist views that result in terrorist acts.
All of the religions, when interpreted strictly, are incompatible with the 21st century. There is nothing inherently evil about Islam.

The problem is that Islam has not had an enlightenment period and a moderation of ideals, like Christianity had when the New Testament was written. If the more extreme practices in Christianity were still supported or accepted, you would be seeing a similar situation. Combine a lack of 'enlightenment' of Islam with corrupt nations, repressive dictators, and foreign intervention, and you get radical religious ideas.
A move in the right direction.
If you have time to watch a YouTube video on Christmas celebration in Malaysia, a Muslim country, you may be surprised how it is being celebrated there and what you watch may change your view on Islam.
Fight against extremism is still a long way from fighting fundamentalism.  Fighting ISIS is all well and good, but nothing changes if the new regime of Muslims still instill Sharia Law on their own population.
When one of your core beliefs is "dying for our god will give us the greatest reward in heaven" your religion will always have an extremist edge. Humanity needs to do away with these bronze age monotheistic charades and focus on the real world.
Why is everyone so hateful like please for the love of god chill

“Religion. It's given people hope in a world torn apart by religion.” 
― Jon Stewart
These Sunnies are just being Islamophobic
This is fantastic. The geopolitical struggles of the Middle East is one of the most complex situations in history, and is much much too big for any single action to fix, but this is definitely a good starting point.
I'd love to see some polls done on that group, see how many agree with death for apostasy, oppressive womens right, stoning for adultery , whether sharia law should rule all etc.

It would be funny and telling if most people in the secular would find the anti extremism group, extreme. 
As an Indonesian Ex-Muslims all I can do is laughing at how gullible you progressive are.

You'd believe anything to protect your view.

The official islamic organization in Indonesia is MUI (Majelis Ulama Indonesia), they are practically wahabi and their attack dog FPI (Front Pembela Islam) often attacking/disciminating non muslim and demand preferable treatment for muslims (sunni only) from the government.

Every 50 meters, you'll find mosque but when Christians want to open churches? Nope! Don't even try and if you insist and open one, they'll find a way to forcefully close it. When they find an anecdote of muslims being discriminated somewhere in this world, they'll remember it and use it to justify their assault towards non muslims sometimes in the near future.

How about being Syi'ah? You may as well die.

The only reason this country is still standing is because we **endure** all sort of discrimination. NU (Nahdatul Ulama) is in fact a respectful organization, but they are much less relevant compare to MUI.
Isn't ISIS also Sunni?
About time a truly relevant Muslim group spoke out against extremism. Still waiting on all the imams in Saudi, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Turkey, and on and on to grow some balls- unless they support extremism.
Looking forward to NOT reading about this in the papers. 
Late to the party, but welcome news.
Why don't we see cops do that to separate themselves from "bad cops"? Why don't we see Christians separate themselves from guys like the Planned Parenthood terrorists? Too much hypocrisy.
good, we need the moderates on our side... as a part of the in-group they're easily in the best position to identify and report people who might so shit like this
If you think about "Muslims" in the world at large, and don't think about Indonesia, you're not actually thinking about Muslims at all. It's the country with the most Muslims on Earth. 

Indonesia *alone* has nearly 2/3rd of the Muslims of the entire Middle East AND North Africa. And no one really thinks of it or talks about it. 

Good post. 
nice
Good!
This is great.
So according to Wikipedia, they follow the Shafi'i school. Also according to Wiki, the Shaf'i school says that: "execution is the traditional recommended punishment for both men and women apostates"...

For fucks sake, these are the moderates...?
Don't kid yourself that Muslims haven't been speaking out against extremism for years. It can only help to repeat it, and hopefully this story gets some traction, but there are many examples and quotes from moderate Muslims speaking out against violence.
ITT: youtube quality comments. Pages of them.
I want to point out that Indonesian Islam is different from Arab Islam in some respects so it's easier for someone from such a place to be outspoken about Islam when the penalties for being critical aren't there or are much more lenient. You'll know a corner has *really* been turned when there are similar organizations in Saudi Arabia.
Go Indonesia! I used to live there. wonderful people.
Much needed but I have a feeling it will be two press conferences then back to ignoring the problem. 
"Still not enough."/"Doesn't count because____."-probably the majority of this thread 

I'd love to be proven wrong however.
ITT: People that always complained about muslims not getting together and trying to put a stop to ISIS. 

Now the same people are complaining that the muslims trying to go against ISIS need to change islam completely or there will be no progress. 
This movement doesn't have much merit until they denounce imposing Sharia Law on the world and condemning people with different beliefs. 

It's like a cigarette smoker who joins an anti-cancer program while refusing to quit smoking. The fundamental issue remains untouched and it's still at the finger pointing stage.
We don't need the worlds largest Sunni movement to campaign against *extremism.*  We need them to campaign against *orthodoxy*; that is, the belief that the medieval warlord known as the prophet Mohammad is the moral exemplar for Muslims in the 21st century.

They also need to stop teaching their children that the Koran is the literal word of God spoken to Mohammad in the Arabic language.
Can they start with Aceh .. the islamists have been going crazy there !
Yeah but when will the muslim community actually get up and condemn extremism. /s
Very predictable HuffPo comments section.
Good Initiative...
So...its ok to criticize Islam in Indonesia now or just business as usual?
Good. Changes on this scale take time... generations, centuries. It did not happen overnight and it will not resolve overnight but a beginning has been made. Support it. We must, as a world population, move towards peace and inclusiveness. Time to grow up for all of us.
Good, let's see more of this kind of thing.
Qur'an 2nd edition; 25% less hate speech
I wonder if the world race for clean energy and a big rush to move away from oil dependence is a tactic to remove a hell of a lot of power the Saudi's have around the world, and in preparation for a massive attack on Saudi Arabia in the future.

I think we all know right now that Saudi Arabia is the biggest threat to any type of peace in the middle east and need to be removed as they are even worse than ISIS in many cases as they hire out others to do there dirty work and encourage people to join isis in support of Wahhabism.


Funny how everyone's part of a group or organisation when it comes to world news. Always a good guy/bad guy situation. 
Finally!! People who have the balls to tell people from their own religion that they can fuck off!
There are so many different groups and different factions I am at the point where I don't know whether to cheer or cry when another group announces it's joining the fight. Can't we just build a massive fence around the middle east and let them slug it out between each other or dig a massive underground pipeline and syphon off all the oil? The only reason we give a fuck and have been getting involved there all these years is the black gold. Without that the middle east would just be a backwards baron inhospitable place that no one gave a fuck about.
Why can I only upvote this once? 
So the Indonesian discuss a religious book weekly club decides to stop entire states by a single press release ?

Let's see how that goes ...
Indonesia elected [this guy](http://cdn.ar.com/images/stories/2013/08/jokowi-metal.jpg) to become its President. This tells you about Muslims in Indonesia.
Ahh so Sunni days are ahead for the muslims then
But when are they going to take responsibility for the actions of every other Muslim.
What are evangelicals doing to stop abortion clinic attacks? 
What kind of campaign? Land, sea, air or all three?
"If Muslims are so against ISIS, why don't they speak out against them?"
It isn't the religious fundamentalists that are the problem, it's the fundamentals of the religion. Saudi Arabia's laws are based on their religion. Prove the majority of them that the religion is destructive to humanity and maybe we'll have less crazy fundamentals going around bombing people in the name of their supposed god.
A front 
It is true terrible things have been done in the name of religion including Islam and Christianity. But there is a marked difference between the two. Christianity's central figure is that of Jesus Christ whose life and teachings emphasizes non-violence, loving your enemies, turning the other cheek, and generosity towards the poor. On the other hand, Islam's central figure is Muhammad who lived a life of war, violence, and misogyny. 
This is just delaying the inevitably of islam fading into obscurity where it belongs. Santa isn't real mother fuckers. 
Ah, religious people getting mad at other religious people for being more religious than them. "Religious moderation is the product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance". 
Militant muslims want to kill you. Moderate muslims want militant muslims to kill you.
This is like wearing pink ribbons for cancer... good intentions but doesn't actually accomplish anything.  So going around denouncing extremism is suppose to stop IS from bombing/killing? And how is this a global campaign? Don't get me wrong, I understand they are trying to prevent people from equating Islam with terrorism but only ignorant people have that point of view.  I suppose there is nothing that can really be done by the average Muslim to combat the extremists, so spreading the word and enlightening people about what Islam is truly about is the best they can do. 
yeah whatever...

"We'll just tolerantly hate you, infidels."
Hopefully, the trend of Muslims acknowledging Islam as the problem continues. 
Bullshit! Clear bullshit! Like all those Oil and Gas companies who launch 1000 trees planting campaign in public to claim that they care about Environment. Sounds good, but very ineffective.
Nice. I don't think it'll work though.

I do not think the religion of Islam is compatible with western civilization- and this isn't inherent to the faith, it's inherent to calculated gradual design.

The Koran can be quite open minded. Sometimes. They view scripture as the lens of truth that conveys the light of the world. It isn't the ONLY source of truth, but it is the one through which you should look at the world through. You can see the truth of reality or God (call it what you will) in anything, especially through the lens of the koran.

That's... pretty open minded actually.

Yet, sadly, I have not seen this actually practiced. It's merely a good arguing point.

Extremism composes about 20% or more of people who practice Islam. I'm puling that number out of my ass, but I recall it from a PEW study I saw about 3 months ago.

I came to Israel to aide in race relations, and ultimately I want to work with Palestinians and Israelis to close the gap.

I work mainly with bedouins, and all I see is women seeking to desperately escape their culture. I see it so pervasive, even their families support their endeavor to become doctors and nurses, teachers, and some, prime minister... its beautiful. It's wonderful I get to assist in that.

But I see it as a slow becoming reality. And it means nothing for Islam as a whole. Even worse, the Israeli viewpoint on Muslims is that they are vermin. I've literally heard them described by multiple people as no more than dogs. I hate that.

Here is a culture that predates Islam, that has existed when the Egyptians controlled this land, then the Babylonians, Hittites, Assyrians, Romans... Bedouin have always been here.

I just cannot see Islam being something accepted by the western world. I can only see people who have left, or reduced their activity in the faith succeeding.

And that makes me sad- 2 billion people who have fundamental world views that are incompatible, and violent towards the rest of the world.

I'm not quite like my dad- who advocates the elimination of the faith, but the entire middle east will be left behind by this attitude.

And will continue to cause problems.
When are they going to stop killing the other sects? 
Do they support equal rights for women, free expression, open criticism, and the right for Muslims to leave the religion?
if not, perhaps they should start their campaign by killing themselves.
The problem is Islam. 

Source: The [Qur'an.](http://quran.com/) Before you respond, read it. I personally will not tolerate this religion. 

bla bla bla bla this is just hot air. They arent gunna do anything
Anyone can say something.

Yah because the Indonesians are great people...Just look what they did with East Timor. Oh wait.
All these issues, all those discussions and mental gymnastics and *wars* for religion.


I still don't get why. Theists, are your beliefs really worth all this?
None of this means shitt if Western governments keep toppling their countries and selling extremists weapons
A non-Muslim Indonesian here. Nahdlatul Ulama is awesome. They are a real deal. This is not just a PR campaign. They have been a force of moderation and harmony in Indonesia for decades.

Let me highlight its previous leader (he died a couple of years ago), Gus Dur

&gt; There have been other gestures in the past. When other Muslim leaders here joined in the condemnation of the British author Salman Rushdie, Mr. Wahid stood alone in his defense. When others condemned Israel, he visited Jerusalem to accept a prize in honor of the assassinated leader Yitzhak Rabin.
[NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/21/world/man-in-the-news-abdurrahman-wahid-revered-criticized-by-some-and-often-prankish.html)



&gt; I once travelled with him into Central Java to watch him preside over a religious ceremony, in a village that claimed to have just manufactured the world’s largest Koran. On the way there, he told me a joke that marked him out as an unusual Muslim leader. “Have you noticed,” he said, “that when the Jews pray, they stand by a wall and whisper. The Christians kneel and speak very quietly. But we Muslims stand in a tower and shout through a megaphone. It makes you wonder who is closer to God.” At this, he roared with laughter. [FT](http://blogs.ft.com/the-world/2009/12/remembering-gus-dur/)



&gt;"Wahid: "I think there is a wrong perception that Islam is in disagreement with Israel. This is caused by Arab propaganda. We have to distinguish between Arabs and Islam. Some people in Indonesia claimed that I was a stooge for the West, but the fact that I am gaining in popularity all the time dispels this idea, and shows that this is the view of only a small minority of the elite. I always say that China and the Soviet Union have or had atheism as part of their constitution, but we have long-term relationships with both these countries. So then Israel has a reputation as a nation with a high regard for God and religion - there is then no reason we have to be against Israel." [Haaretz](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/a-friend-of-israel-in-the-islamic-world-1.127792)

The young scholars of NU also run [IslamLib](http://islamlib.com/), which is an enlightened discussion and publication forum on Islam, with emphasis on diversity of opinion. 

edit:formatting
Cool ,but this will do absolutely nothing to stop terrorism.
Sometimes I feel like reddit is brainwashing me. As soon as a terrorist attack happens...plonk, here's a feel good Muslim story.
Extremism can happen in any religion. For example, there are people who claim to be Christians but do not celebrate Christmas because they believe that Christmas originates from paganism or it is not mentioned in the bible. If you wish to know more about this, you can find it out from http://www.equip.org/article/should-christians-celebrate-christmas/. 
But in reality, absolutely nothing will change.
Too bad its a front. Islam's stated goal is to convert everyone in the world and kill those who do not convert or actively fight against it.
A little too late to be honest.. 
Bull. Shit. All of this. 
Didn't they give a fatwa in favor of female genital mutilation?

[Yep.](http://www.thefridaytimes.com/tft/self-defeating-extremes/#sthash.uK8Dp2kh.dpuf)

&gt;Not after Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) with 40 million followers in Indonesia has given a fatwa in favour of FGM?

Edit: [INDONESIA: Female genital mutilation persists despite ban](http://www.irinnews.org/report/90366/indonesia-female-genital-mutilation-persists-despite-ban)

&gt;“Even a small wound on the genitals can lead to sexual, physiological and physical problems,” Duarsa said. 

&gt;Indonesia forbade health officials from the practice in 2006 because they considered it a “useless” practice that “could potentially harm women's health”. 

&gt;However, the ban was quickly opposed by the Indonesian Ulema Council, the highest Islamic advisory body in Indonesia. 

&gt;In March this year, the Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the country's largest Muslim organization, issued an edict supporting FGM/C, though a leading cleric told the NU’s estimated 40 million followers “not to cut too much”. 

&gt;“It is against human rights,” said Maria Ulfah Anshor, a women’s rights activist and former chair of the women’s wing of the NU. “For women there is absolutely no benefit and advantage.” 
Showing disgust with the IS and terrorism is pointless without a reform of Islam. Exegesis of the Quran still is an authoritarian practice, defined by a teachers arbitration. Some Muslims have moderate teachers, some have Salafist teachers. And I believe that those who say that Islam is the religion of Peace and Terrorists are no real Muslims are truthful. But they don't read Quran critical or as a historical document either, they just cherry-pick different passages. 

If Muslim groups  said that the Quran is a historical document that needs (humanist) guidelines to read or interpret properly, some change would be possible.
So where is the movement to de-radicalize Christian terrorist white men that gun down people visiting their doctor? 
He's quite willing to adhere to the conclusion that the reason why the Muslim world was in stagnation since the 18th century.
"It launched its global anti-extremism initiative in 2014."  A lot of good that did.

"On Nov. 14, the Indonesian Ulema Council, the country's top Muslim clerical body, which includes NU, announced a plan to mobilize 50,000 preachers to spread moderate, or "Wasathiyah," Islam within Indonesia."  Preaching to the choir...  It looks like a lot of talking and precious little doing.

Hopefully they advocate against the death penalty for drug dealers and advocate for women's rights.
This story needs to make national headlines right now.  It's important that the world doesn't have a witch hunt for all Muslims.  Just like everyone else in the world, there are good Muslims too, and this is an example of something good happening.
Wasn't this the country that allowed the Bali bombers to live and not face the death sentence  but rather give drug dealers a death sentence. 
Their hashtags must be really awesome 
Lets start with the Wahabbis in Saudi Arabia. Maybe stoning a woman for adultery isn't the right answer. Maybe publicly beheading people isn't a humane punishment. Islam doesn't just have a problem with terrorism it has a problem with fundamentalism and this is going to continue to clash with western ideals like free speech and the idea that everyone should be treated equally.
I feel like it's going to take more than rhetoric and ideologies to stop the beheadings
I HOPE THEY DECAPITATE ALL EXTREMISTS!

(it's a joke)
Integrity, that's a welcome sight.
From the country that brings you strict Sharia Law, and the producers of *The East Timorese Crisis* (1999), starring all the Sunni Muslims you've come to love from an attempted genocide in 1974, Huffington Post brings you **THE NAHDLATUL ULAMA** (2015).
Does the campaign involve arming their populace, overthrowing the leaders if ISIS and middle eastern governments that support terrorism and jihad? Were they to depose these tyrants, would all who live in the reclaimed territories be allowed freedom of speech and religion? Would gays be safe from summary execution and women safe from stonings for showing too much skin?
Aren't ISIS sunni?
I like seeing this.

I would like to see people like the Ayatollah say this, as we try and engage in peace with Iran as well. 
If true, this is a good step.  But issuing statements, by itself, is pitifully too little, too late.  Are they willing to put boots on the ground in Syria?  How about accepting some of those refugees?
I knew this would happen Sunni or later.
Way to show up to the party 14 years too late. But hey, did they bring house warming gifts? Then we're cool. 
They'd have to reject their profit to pull that off.

I wish them well in competing against the 100 billion dollars that Saudi Arabia has already pumped into the middle-east to fund extremism. 
Wow, about god damn time
Um, yeah, so...bout fucking time.
Ya there are alot of anti extremest muslims who dont prescribe to the isis cause...they are are being executed by the hundreds by isis....
About time 
Uh... finally
Neat.  It's not a massive shift, but it's a great start that I certainly welcome.
Took them long enough. 
For the record: most extremism in the Muslim world at the same time comes from Sunni groups, and the Ba'athist regime in Syria and the former regime in Iraq are/were also Sunni. But that's hardly surprising, because 90% of all Muslims are Sunni. And most Christian extremism in countries which are predominantly Calvinist/Evangelical comes from Calvinist/Evangelical denominations--if the US were predominantly Roman Catholic, I'm sure we'd see that most extremists would be Catholic. The problem is people, not denomination.
It's about fucking time they did something about it. Now, see to it till ends. 
Wahabbism needs to go!


They just now started doing this? Have they thought there was never a problem before?
World's largest Muslim group commits to apostasy.

I'm not arguing about whether or not it was unjust. It definitely was unjust. However, the systems we (humans) have developed, and will continue to do so, as a society will undoubtedly always favor one group over another. The way in which second class citizens experience that marginalization has had different names throughout history. (i.e. Ghettos used by Nazis, Jim Crow  laws in the US, Slave labor in Gulf Nations, Apartheid in S.Africa) 

We, as humans, have yet to create an ideal society that recognizes the rights of each individual. 
Just mass protest in a Asian country wont do. The powerful Islamic countries need to join the protest. I mean - UAE, Saudi Arabia.

This is great.
Finally some sane people realize extremism will only bane than boon to their "suppressed" religion.
When you act violently the world will only respond in a more violent way.
Why is this here but not my the front page? weird
You're a bit late.
Forget the politicking and meaningless grandstanding. Police your own kind, *with force.* If they want to be taken seriously as a "peaceful religion" they need to deal with the violent outliers with extreme swiftness and relentless prejudice. 
Sorry guys, you are going to get lumped in with enemies of the state unless you do a hell of a lot more.  People are committing jihad on our streets and id guess It's about to get worse. 
Oh. No. We need a good steady supply of terrorists so that our military can have jobs. We can't have antiterrorist war witjout terrorists.
Correct me if I'm wrong, because I don't know anything about Islam. But Sunni's better then Shiites? As in they are more calm or something? 
I find this to be....encouraging.
The above headline is misleading and should be tagged as such. The headlines at the site are okay. But the above makes it seem as if all Sunnis nobly fought extremism – when actually, the extremists this is in opposition to are pretty much all Sunni themselves. So it's *one* large Sunni group against the much smaller Sunni extremist cohort – pretty much a Sunni-internal contest (or dare I say jihad).
Very happy to hear this.  Hopefully this will be echoed through the religion in all regions.   This is a big step in removing the credibility ISIS and terrorists get from the religion.  
About time.
Good. Now if we can get the soccer fans to launch a movement to end barbaric treatment of people constructing stadiums.

Every day goes by and I have yet to hear an apology, just one apology, from a soccer fan about the thousands of lives lost in constructing their stadiums. Jackasses like John Oliver go on television and brag about how even though they know they support corrupt organizations they'll still go with it because soccer is their calling. This sub needs to get on soccer fans like they do with Muslims.
Of course to them "extremism" is valuing life, treating women as people, and not following Sharia.
Ive taught my self that Sunny Muslims are assholes and the Shiites muslims were decent.  I also taught myself that the good brown guys wear turban.  Seiks?  The ones that have nothing to do with islaam.

I know that most of these people are peaceful but I need to be proven differently.  So far I like Siekhs the best.
Good
Right.
so how does one become a member of this supposed group?
I hope that includes all sorts of extremism and Islamic terrorism not just ISIS. It can't be that on one hand the Islamic world will condemn fanatic Islamic acts and on the other hand allow terror acts against Jews in Israel. Islamic fanatics are the root evil and sickness this world should throw up. 
How many terrorists have come from Indonesia?
Too little; too late.
What the fuck took them so long
Let's revisit this 'movement' in 5 years and check on their progress, then we can judge.  Until then, I don't believe them.
They are wasting their time. Most of these terrorists are insane / morons, I doubt they actually "read" anything. Stupidity is a fact of life and it is better to just invest more into surveillance / gun control.
Better late than never I suppose...
Based on that article, ISIS is the fundamentalist version of Saudi Arabia? Jeez I guess that explains why the Saudis are more in the news lately for trying to smuggle drugs than take any sort of action whatsoever in the region. 
I really really hope this gets seen-- how can we support them? I am so impressed to see that regular Muslims are organizing, working together, and battling radicalization. How can we pitch in or show solidarity? What do they need from regular folks around the world to be more effective?
About friggin time.
Fuck, that's one annoying redirection ruining this link 
I'm glad to see Indonesians combating extremism. I'm skeptical of their success in shaping religion worldwide, though I'm hopeful for their success domestically.
First good news I've heard all year.
This isn't going to change anything worldwide. NU is an Indonesian based organization, that's where most of its membership comes from. It doesn't have much influence in the Middle East.
Indonesia is the place where they massacred all the communists, right? I remember watching a documentary with a fat guy in a red dress dancing around pretty girls, something about strangling hundreds of people with a pole and a length of fencing wire. Maybe some weird indonesian corruption cult isn't the best horse to back in this race. 
Money out of us politics solves all the problems 
Wow 14 years later. Thanks Muslims 
This is like the KKK adopting a highway. Too little too late. 
thats kind of extreme...
If the Sunni world wants to fix their problem, label Salafi's as heretics under Shariah law and treat them as Shariah law calls them to treat heretics.  

Allowing Salafi's to practice their hate at this time is going to end up to 100K's if not millions of dead people.
We need more of that. 
Extreme anti-extremism. 
its interesting to find argumetns against wahabbism making mainstream arguments, this makes me really happy
Reminds me of that Simpsons scene with the alien cookbook for humans and the space-dust..

"Wait a minute..."
It's funny how people think that all religions are intrinsically good, just because it's a religion. It's like the apologists cant accept that something can actually be bad. If Naziism was a religion, would these same people who defend Islam be defending Nazism?
Is Nahdlatul Ulama big in [Aceh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceh#Government)?
It's like that easy catholic girl.

Don't.  Stop.  No.  Really.  I mean it.  Don't stop.  Don't stop! Don't stop!!
About time a truly relevant Muslim group spoke out against extremism. Still waiting on all the imams in Saudi, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Turkey, and on and on to grow some balls- unless they support extremism.
&gt;the U.K.'s Muslim Youth League has declared "ideological holy war" against extremism

And yet, people like asshole Choudary enjoy freedom of expression on mainstream media.
Oh, this is going to be sweet, like the Bloods vs Crips rivalry.
A HuffPo headline without the word "Smash" in it? What's this world coming to?
What I've seen so far:

Omar Ismail Mostefai: was a known radical and is believed to have trained with Isil inside Syria last year

Bilal Hadfi: He fought with Islamic State in Syria as recently as this spring, using the names Abu Moudjahid Al-Belgiki and Bilal Al Mouhajir.

Samy Amimour: French police issued an international arrest warrant the following year, after he went missing and was suspected of having traveled to Syria to join Islamic State.

Abdel Hamid Abaaoud: He is believed to have been in Raqqa in April/June 2014, then Tabka, Deir ez Zor and finally Kobani.

Intelligence agencies say some evidence shows they trained for the attack in Syria. All these people have EU passports. All these people were in Syria months before the attack. All these people were on some kind of watch list. How did they get back to EU?

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11996120/Paris-attack-what-we-know-about-the-suspects.html
&gt;Just 10-20 per cent of EU citizens have their passports checked against a database designed to catch foreign fighters returning from Syria and Iraq, the paper claimed. 

THA FUCK? Is it just me, or did we all assume every ID was run against "the list".
Doesn't that mean that the problem is a lot worse than we think it is?
I don't understand these straw man arguments from both sides.  This is getting ridiculous. 

It's not that either A)  refugees will cause terrorist attacks because they were involved in the terrorist attacks as the extreme right claims,  but it's also not B)  that no refugee was involved on the terrorist attacks so no refugee is a threat as the extreme left claims. 

Life isn't black and white,  its murky grey.  I'm an immigrant,  so I'm not xenophobic or racist but there is a legitimate concern that  Daesh terrorists will infiltrate within the refugee ranks to commit terror within the western world.  The head of the FBI has already stated that there's no way to vet all the refugees to ensure that no terrorists are entering with the refugees. 

My point is,  that we shouldn't be playing political football with these straw man arguments of 'was a terrorist a refugee?'  It honestly doesn't matter.  We should  be addressing the elephant in the room; how do we vet refugees to ensure the safety of the native population whilst doing the our best to support families fleeing their own terror?  

The moment we start asking and trying to answer that question the better.  I'm sick and tired of both sides; they are either completely demonizing all refugees or completely white washing them..  Neither is right. 

The fact of the matter is that these refugees unfortunately come from a war torn part of the world that has a history of committing  acts of war on innocent civilians,  this isn't the same as accepting Vietnamese or Korean  refugees who have no history of attacking innocent people.  It's a legitimate concern that has to be addressed.  The most concerning aspect of the refugee crisis is that, if we are talking  about potential 'sleeper'  terrorists within the refugee ranks,  then Daesh are already discussing it too.

Edit: words. 
It's convenient that they mention passports instead of nationality because fake passports aren't a thing?
this is actually worse, if these are 2nd gen immigrant this is worse than if it were refugees.
http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/16/us-france-shooting-bomber-greece-idUSKCN0T50U420151116

Except for that one guy who's fingerprints match a refugee entering Greece a few months ago.
[deleted]
Yes and most of them have been in Syria. So it's not like we don't have a filter to find the bad apples. But at the end of the day the genocide will happen by outbreeding and not attacks....
If I knew my son joined ISIS in 2013 I would report his ass to the authority sooner before he commit a mass murder. I'm just saying.
Questions, are immigrants and refugees being used synonymously now? I thought immigrants were people permanently relocating usually for benefits of living in the new area while refugees are people relocating temporarily for safety and generally want to go home. Are the refugees from the middle east planning on staying in Europe permanently or if conditions improve will they go back? Is a country able to send refugees back to Syria once it is safe enough ?
In other words, decades of lax immigration policies and zero cultural integration has left nations like France full of legal Muslim residents who hate them and wish them dead. Brilliant. 
The journalist is deliberately being disingenuous.

It has already been established that one of the terrorists that blew himself up [entered Europe posing as a refugee](http://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-stadium-attacker-entered-europe-via-greece-1447698583), and [others have tried to follow suit](http://news.yahoo.com/turkey-detains-8-europe-bound-suspects-posing-refugees-112604479.html).

I support continuing to take refugees, but let's stick to reporting the facts shall we.
Pay enough money and you'll get a Passport. And ISIS does have money.
many of them have made trips to syria tho, and one of them traveled with a fake passport because he was on a wanted list and pretended to be a refugee to travel back from syria into europe.
This only furthers the fact that terrorism isnt a symptom of economic status or national HDI, but a cultural problem that transcends borders.
I live in a german city located in Lower Saxony. As of right now we took in around 10000 refugees in 2014 and 2015 combined. At least 10% of those are not of legal age.
Growing up in a bad neighborhood myself and having a lot of lebanese, kurdish and kosovo albanian friends I was one of those people who gave in into the media hype and frenetically greated those trains that arrived in our city. 
Meanwhile time has passed and I am seriously shocked when I think about the outcome.

- Two of my friends were robbed and brutally beaten by a huge group of underage refugee kids who were later caught during an attack on another group of people on the same day. 

- One of our female friends was followed by two refugees during her commute from work. they started to make comments about her looks (makeup+skirt) and then tried to pull her out of the train when it stopped at one of the less public stops. Her only luck was the fact that a couple of ticket collectors who were checking peoples tickets in a different wagon saw this whole situation and were able to detain the two guys until Police came

I could tell a whole lot of more stories like these but they always go the same way.

The notable difference between the immigrant people that I grew up with and those that came the last couple years is the intention to be a part of this society. 
Of course it is stupid to generalize and go on about every refugee, but I have never seen people being so frustrated in our city.
Even those who once were refugees themselve are shocked by the behaviour of the people that we took in. And the most worrying fact is you never see anything about this in newspapers.
I understand that they dont want to create negative sentiment regarding the whole refugee situation but withholding the truth from the rest of the Country is not the right way either.
One snuck back into Europe from Syria since he was on the Terror List.
&gt;Furthermore, since the attacks, more than 420,000 people have signed a petition calling on the UK to 'close its borders', despite pleas for people not to blame refugees for the attacks in Paris, and warnings from the UN that refugees should not be used as 'scapegoats'.

What if I told you that wanting to close the borders is not about blaming the refugees?

Seriously what is up with this strawman that every journalist seem to spout without giving it a little thought?
In many cases "home grown" terrorists are radicalized by recent immigrants/refugees/asylum seekers.  In the 90's the UK accepted and protected radical Wahhabi imams and students who went on to influence second generation Muslim Brits.  Including the Egyptian born Abu Hamza al-Masri, who was the Imam at the Finsbury Park Mosque, a true hotbed for Islamic extremism from the mid-90's until 2004--he came to the UK in '80 on a student visa and married an Englishwoman, but after a stint fighting with the Bosnians and openly supporting radical tactics, he was protected and openly preached hate and violence.  
Why allow refugees in the first place? Why not give foreign aid and help thru stay inside their country while they work to fix it? Why are most of them men? 
Auto play videos are terrible.
So now instead of not wanting refugees we'll not want people who have been here for years.
That makes the terrorist threat that much worse.
Isn't this kind of scarier. I mean if these were refugees you could say hey they were just following orders and could be under some form of duress. This just makes me think that some portion of the refugees will have children who grow up to commit terrorist acts. Is that really any better. 
The terrorists can be anybody and from anywhere and they may be the citizens of French in the case of Paris attack. They are wide spreaded. Any Muslim may be a terrorist or it's sympathizer that later becomes a terrorist when he/she has a chance to join.
Not refugees =/= Didn't come from Syria
Were we able to establish what major religion they acted in the name of?
Disenfranchised Muslim youths in Europe are the issue. For some reason, 2nd and 3rd generation Muslims are more extreme than their parents in general. This could be due to a romantisized view of their home country/culture, or a lack of sense of self, which then makes them more prone to being radicalized by douchecanoes. The internet could play a role, but so could perceived (or true) xenophobia. 

For example, most people asking for Sharia in the UK are 2nd-3rd generation Pakistanis. Most of them have a British passport, and most of them are British citizens, born and raised. And yet they espouse views that are in complete contradiction with British values. 
It's frightening that people are celebrating it like it's a victory.
A study commissioned by the CDU in Germany (a government study) found that a stunning 48 percent rejected integration and German values.

It is literally no surprise that the Muslim terrorists were native Frenchmen.  As soon as Muslims reach a critical mass in a society, its very typical for them to be either aggressively political, and if they aren't placated, then outright violent (as we've seen both in Europe and Africa.)
It's only proved one thing. Islam, even at developed countries, refused to change/modernize. There are Islam followers that prefer barbaric lifestyle, over contemporary one.
And all of them are arabs. Them having a EU passport only means we are stupid enough to give out passports to whomever.
Even though they were so called 'French Nationals,' isn't it safe to say all were islamic radicals who committed crimes in the name of Mohammad?  
Nidal Hassan was thoroughly vetted. 
He became famous as the Fort Hood shooter..
What about economic reasons for not taking in refugees? All conservatives talk about is terrorism and all liberals talk about is racism. I'm just hoping for a zombie apocalypse. 
The real crime against humanity is the auto playing video. Fuck you independent.
Has anyone thought maybe there are other negatives to taking in refugees than possible terrorism? The world isn't exactly in great shape economically.
&gt; The eight terror suspects named so far are not refugees and all have EU passports

But none are Europeans
Isn't there a city of air-conditioned tents in Saudi Arabia that is capable of housing 1 million people just outside Mecca? Why not go there? Or stay in Turkey or any of the other nations closer to you culturally and religiously not to mention geographically.
Why do they have to live with us to be a violent burden on an already overburdened tax infrastructure?
Who actually said it was the refugees that carried out the attack? There were fears that it would have been IS fighters sent masquerading as refugees, IS even said they would do this!

This is actually a lot worse
It's a tough situation - I have NO doubt that ISIS will slip some of their operatives into the stream of refugees, whether or not they have done it yet.  But does that mean that we should ignore the suffering and desperation of tens of thousands of people  because a handful might have ill intentions?

It reminds me a bit of the movement toward prison/sentencing reforms in the US - undoubtedly some 'non-violent' prisoner held on a drug offense will get released early and end up committing a violent crime.  When that happens will there be a backlash against lighter sentencing? 
so what?   
On the contrary, it shows integration has failed...
But doesn't that just argue against letting Muslim populations establish themselves further? I mean I don't expect refugees fleeing a war to radicalise but I don't expect, if they hold importance to their Islamic faith, that their kids who don't remember Syria to turn like they do today
Ok, so what? Why should I be willing to accept people who aren't going to be helping me, or anyone around me at all?

I've been a liberal my whole life but this mass immigration stuff is NUTS. It's almost like the new world religion, to believe that people of any faith/race/ethnicity/nationality all are totally the same. They are not.

We have very LITTLE benefit for helping these immigrants by taking them in. But we run high risk for taking them in. It's really not much of a decision. No reason to take in refugees. Also, don't think that just because they are "trying to escape ISIS" means that they love the west. There are various branches of Islam, not everyone who hates the US is in ISIS.
In my opinion its more worrisome that people who are within western countries are becoming radicalized and committing terror attacks.  If they came from Syria you could say that it is a regional issue in the middle east, but this just shows that people growing up in Muslim communities inside Europe can become radicalized.  Islam doesnt fit in the West
That make sense.  How can a refugee know enough about Paris locale and know how to get illegal fire-arms?  Even a native Syrian or Iraq terrorist would be a fish out of water in Paris, needing weeks just to know how to get around town. 
Oh so he's not one of the Fugees?
Donwnvote worthy (probably?):

Integration of Middle Eastern immigrants had failed horribly all over the European Union. Why not make an effort to occupy all the trouble countries and run them for humanitarian reasons? Some of them are going to protest, riot and kill people either way! Why not sort the good people out while running all these former colonies and let them move to wherever they like?
I fucking knew it. No excuses now. Let's bring another million refugees. No, let's bring another 10 million. Europe is fucked already.
Not trying to take away from whatever point you're trying to make. But if they're naming suspects of course they're naming all the ones with passports! They don't know the ones without them...
Sons of immigrants are still doing this. In short, they are fucked.
"*Eighth suspect (unidentified) carrying stolen passport in name of 'Ahmad al-Mohammad', 25 - from Idlib, Syria"

the headline of this thread fails to mention THIS from the article - some terrorists are POSING as syrians, because the door is wide open
okay this may be, and ISIS may be evil but they are not retarded. one of their main goals is to infiltrate opposing nations and conduct terrorist attacks. during the immigration crisis, hundreds of thousands of refugees were entering the EU without being identified or having their backgrounds tracked. Now tell me that any competent terrorist organization wouldn't seize this opportunity to send covert agents into these countries. Lets wait for another couple years and see how many more attacks occur and who purported them. this title and thread is going about the notion that: ITS BEEN PROVEN, NO TERRORISTS WERE AMONG THE THOUSANDS ILLEGALLY ENTERING THE EU. 
Yes - because a passport has never been stolen or faked, and no criminal has ever gotten away without being noticed...

It's not impossible and wasn't it already reported one was a refugee identifiable by his thumb post-detonation?
bound to happen, when you throw around passports like free candy.
Gentlemen, please.

Irish genealogist Shiu Lanfen, thanks to the charity of Tomas Müller Nigerian prince, was able to find solid proof that Ismaël Omar Mostefaï was indeed a native Frenchman.

Yours sincerely, Hafthór Olaf Björnsson, Mexican reporter.
Again, this does not mean anything at all. This is not about refugees, it is about Islam and Syria.     
The fact that the religion is horrible in every way, goes against western thought and is largely followed in Syria.     
Just because some of these people are running from there does in no way mean they are friendly or want to adopt our ways.     
This is all fucked up, but we don't want to spread this shit into our own countries, wise up.
The headline is anecdotal in the migration debate.   Just because that cell wasn't of migrants doesn't mean that others went and it doesn't mean that migrants won't set up terror cells.
The terrorists are not trying to win a military victory. They are trying to isolate Muslims and prevent them from assimilating.
How is that relevant if they came in pretending to be refugees? 
&gt; The information may throw a more cautionary light on our reactions to refugees - for contrary to rumour, none of the named suspects recently arrived in Europe from Syria or elsewhere, and most had been born - or grew up - in France and Belgium.
Too bad you progressive hacks aren't aware of the homegrown radical Islam in France decades prior to Hebdo / Bataclan.  Absolutely no surprise the fire came from within.  Sadly, you can't put two and two together since unchecked refugee immigration IS one of the many fuels that feed this fire. 
&gt; so far

Give it a few years.
Good, we can now focus on the real issue at hand, not refugees, but religious extremists. Just to clarify this is an ISLAM issue.
wow we are safe from islam now

/s
"Of course, that several of the dead Islamic terrorists were born in Europe may seem like an argument against letting in world-historical numbers of refugees, because this shows, once again, that assimilation takes generations. The sons and perhaps grandsons of Merkel’s Millions may be killing European civilians for sport in the mid- or even late 21st century."

This is irrelevant. It only takes one jihadist posing as a refugee to fuck everything up  
Does it matter that they weren't refugees? They were immigrants, which can be seen as worse.
Does it matter?

The pressing issue with the new refugees is the danger that their children will be radicalised the same way as these assholes were. After all they'll realize that Europe is not the land of milk and honey, and that they are on the bottom of the social ladder, as all refugees and migrants are in every part of the world. Add to this the incredible differences in culture, the feeling of isolation and alienation, and you will end up with a ton more young males ripe for rationalization. So who the fuck cares if they were NOT refugees? This is not the point at all. It's only a red herring to avoid talking about this issue.
Don't really give a shit, I'm still not keen on the idea of creating communities for isis soldiers to blend into in my country seems like a foolish idea. Rather anyone wants to acknowledge it or not this is a Muslim problem at it's core. Oh but i'm sure I'll be called a racist for having contempt toward a religion.
So that clearly means not one refugee can ever be a terrorist. 
"Bilal Hadfi- french." Yeah that name sounds french alright, and im john smith- chinese. 
Gtfo none of those bastards is French OR Belgian, no matter what passport you give them. 

So not only the Muslim refugees are dangerous..all Muslims are?
European born and raised Muslims with EU passports committing acts of terror only strengthens the case against permitting the growth of Islam in Europe. 
But. It turns out they are all Muslim. Like the refugees.
So, are they saying that we are several years late with our skepticism of permitting refugees? 
What about the reports saying that their passports are fakes?
Rand Paul put forward some very handsome legislation concerning this.
I don't get why it matters if they are immigrants. They are obviously middle eastern with zero motivation to assimilate to European culture who are there just for financial benefit. Why should Europe or USA allow those people in to ruin what they worked hard to create since the Inquisition days?
So then, this was domestic terrorism?
And how many of their parents were refugees?
People upvoting this; Europe is even less secure than you'd hope.
Bull and shit.
So what you're saying is that the second generation is worse than the first generation of immigrants. 
They are all refugees who got an EU passport.
Point? Their parents are not french
Bet all 8 of them were Islamic though!
So the problem isn't so much refugees, but rather the existence of radicalizing mosques in the EU, when they should've been shut down long ago.
Those muslim parents who came to live in european countries, how do they raise their children, what do they teach them?
How come children born from italian, spanish or even asian  immigrants could insert that well, but *they* can't?

[deleted]
Go right ahead there France and keep trying to convince yourself that opening the floodgate for Syrian refugees is a good idea.  Let's see how that works out for you...

It worked out great in the US with our Chechan refugees in Boston.

Just keep your fucking Syrian refugees in France and don't send them here.

Not all Germans were Nazis either, yet how many million died during WWII anyway? 

In case you didn't know, a huge swath of the muslim world still considers Spain practically theirs and wants to take it back.  

http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/04/10/the-reconquista-of-the-mosque-of-cordoba-spain-catholic-church-islam/


Why the fuck are muslims allowed to demand unfettered access to Christian holy sites  to pray in a country like Spain, sites which existed *before* they were invaded by the Moors, yet Christians would be put to death if they started praying and practicing in a mosque?  
The refugees aren't dangerous,  they're desperate and scared.. If an uncontrolled amount arrive,  it will only cause more problems though.. There needs to be planning for the long term, or else they'll all end up in what will basically become ghettos, they'll struggle to find jobs, or have proper housing, their kids grow up, citizens of Europe, in a world where they are basically second class citizens, with less opportunity in life than most others, resenting all the non muslims around them who have a better lives... So they go to back to visit Syria.. Which they've heard great things about.. Aaaaand guess where we're back to.. 

I'm not saying we shouldn't help them, I'm saying there needs to be a long term plan here, a controlled flow that Europe's society's can manage, socially and financially.. The idea of just letting them all in will just not work in the long term.. It will be an unmitigated disaster.. 


As much as they may have been EU citizens/passport holders how were they able to travel to Syria and other terrorist hotbeds without the authorities taking note or red flags not being raised? 
Unless one is on official government business how do they explain a trip to Syria and not be a suspected terrorist? Am sure it is not a prime holiday destination at the moment! They shld be detained and interrogated or  be refused entry back into Europe! 
This article is written as if many people were claiming all these terrorists were Syrian and couldn't imagine they were citizens of some other country.  Is there some documentation of that?  

When there is a Syrian passport found on or next to one of the terrorists I think it is OK for people to say one of the terrorists was a Syrian refugee.  Perhaps that will be proved incorrect at some point in the future but it's not like that was an invented claim by some racist guy that spread around the internet.

That these terrorists were citizens of EU countries is irrelevant.  They were all radical Muslims.  The people trying to stop the Syrian refugees from migrating to their country are afraid due to the, small, risk that some of them are radical Muslims.  To act like as if the two are not connected is intellectually dishonest.  Perhaps focus on the fact that it would likely be a very small number of terrorists in the group of refugees if you want to more effectively change somebody's mind.
Why don't they just cut power, signal, and communications in that part of the region they are in...
All this while we were happy letting them "spread" freedom in Syria and *paying* ~~funding~~ them for it.
We should just destroy ISIS, then the refugees can get their country back. Easy solution
Now to find an easy way to achieve that by making sure we don't create another terror group to replace it....hmmmm
So what you're saying is that strengthening external borders won't help, we need to reinstate the *internal* ones?
But my bigot governor said that the refugees are bad! Who am I to believe?!!?
Can someone explain why these people all seem to carry their passports with them? Not just this time but in lots of attacks the police often say something about identifying them by the passport they had on them. 

Is it common in some places to have it on you all the time? 
This ties in really well to something I read:

ISIS are currently, arguably, the most well funded terrorist group in the world. Why would you send someone through an immigration process that can LITERALLY take 6 months to a year to get through, to MAYBE end up in the country you want them to attack, rather than simply getting the best fake documents money can buy to get them in on the date you want them to be in? Or, recruit people who already reside in the country you want them to be in with your vast, influential network?

People seem to severely underestimate the power of Surveillance States. Don't get me wrong, I'm against Surveillance States. I think they do cause fear and paranoia where they don't belong, but even I can't deny, they are effective.

Fast edit: feel I may have given too much information elaborating on this, deleted it all.
If you guys are interested to know how difficult and bureaucratic it is to even come to the US as a refugee should listen to this episode of This American Life http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/560/abdi-and-the-golden-ticket 
But .. but .. I thought there were already terrorist sleeper cells in the USA!   Or ... are they still sleeping?

Bottom line is this is the new reality.

You can't stop a looney from killing a dozen or so people.  You just can't.  If I wanted to cause a "terrorist attack" I would buy an intercity bus ticket and then swerve us into oncoming traffic on the highway.  You can't even stop kids from shooting up a classroom.  The only thing you can do is try to make as few people as possible want to do something like that.

Even if you don't let a single foreigner in your country anymore, it will happen on a plane outside the country.  Or at the airport.  Or at an embassy.  And there will be 12 dead.  And then 8 the next time.  And then 22.  And we will go through this again and again and again ..

Until there are no more countries left to attack.
Don't worry we will still use it as a reason to keep refugees out of America. Also veterans need help but that's the refugees fault not the senators who have yet to pass a bill to help them
Thought I was in a Youtube comment section for a while.
Wait so people seriously think they can blame refugees or immigration problems on shit like this? ROFL obvious terrorist attack and ppl want to redeem themself by being "smart" and blaming it on something so stupid.
How many were immigrants or sons of immigrants?

the syrians bring a certain islam leaning "culture", and potential non-syrians POSING as them, because the borders are too wide open

even if most syrians are innocent, they bring a lot of un-intentional bad shit to these countries - and obviously france and european countries need more control
Didnt know muslims were native to EU :/
Just shows Muslims don't assimilate.  
Thank god the US has an ocean between us and the Middle East. I don't see what upside there is to any European country for letting in refugees, and I see plenty of risks.
Thank you to Honduras! 

5 male Syrians in their 20's were arrested at an airport in Honduras today. They had fake passports and were on their way to the U.S.

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-34864193
So what they are finding is that it is indeed not the refugees but the faith itself at the root of the issue.  Good to know.
You have a TERRORIST problem.
I call bullshit. 
...and the bullets were fake. Nothing to see here. 
If I'm the Mastermind behind ISIS I would plant a fake refugee passport as a reverse psychology red herring.

TBH terrorists are stupid... Like why haven't they just used women with bombs strapped to look like they are pregnant, who the fuck would ever suspect a pregnant lady?
They are muslims with arab features. I wonder when these idiots invent that maybe some stupid document doesn't describe reality 1:1.
Meaning ... ? Or are you implying?
No Real Refugee fallacy
Went to Syria to fight, came back to reign terror here.
Great point. If they had two passports, getting them out of europe period is a far better approach.
are not != did not pose as.

Classic independent.
So that means their parents were migrants/refugees.
Common sense tells me that refugee doesn't equal terrorist, but fear for my safety and the safety of those I love makes me not want to take any chances. I'm conflicted as hell and my fear is speaking much louder than my reason.
Mm. Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11, no involvement in terrorism outside its borders and no WMD.

A powerful group exists for whom logic is optional.
But are any of them not arabic? 
So what? Is this trying to insinuate entering a country as a refugee isn't something terrorist like to do or something? Pretty sure they will do whatever works...
Looking at the comments it seems like people believe treating refugees super nice will have them forgiving the west for the countless campaigns into the mid east or change the mindset of Islamists...? I don't see the connection-- not that I think we should be mean to them of course, but I don't think we'll be winning any 'points' with them no matter what.
Unless you can re-write their holy book all the extremists could disappear magically but eventually someone else is going to choose to read and ignore none of it. Religion is the problem, but there doesn't seem to be much logic on either side.

Imo, they should close the airports. Don't let anyone go in or out till they make sure all of the ISIS are dealt with. 

Make a new way to deal with the fake passports and such. 

Could help.
No, but they are 2nd or 3rd generations immigrants.
Now imagine if they were brought over with no background check and was let loose amongst thousands of people. Seriously, if 8 people managed to kill 130+ then imagine what even half of even a tenth of 10,000 people could do.
suuuuuuuuuure
The numbers published have been pretty consistent at only 25% refugees among the migrants.
Abdel Hamid Abaaoud confirmed dead in the assault in Saint-Denis (and in a thousand pieces) 
Source : TF1
EU needs to invest in biometric passports. 
&gt;Abdelhamid Abaaoud's father Omar said his son, who has been described as the 'mastermind' of the attacks, had turned his back on a "fantastic" life, and reportedly joined Isis in Syria in 2013.

So how does one join ISIS and then simply return back to their home country with no question? 
There is terrorist gestation period for refugees. How long ago did all of those terrorists emigrate to the EU?
This sounds all too familiar, 9/11 conspiracy anyone?
Can a refugee eventually become an EU resident and obtain an EU passport? Yes
Ive got a driving license doesn't make me lewis Hamilton ! They don't see themselves as European so why should Europeans see them as such ?


Ah well this is proof then that all the refugees are in fact good people with zero ties to ISIS.
Whew! Anyways, lets keep bringing millions of military aged males from radical Islamic nations! It's progressive guys, and you're racist if you don't agree
How is this a good thing? If anything it means that extremism and radicals are far more embedded in Western society than previously imagined. Are you trying to make the case for stricter immigration?
Does it really matter if it's the refugees or the refugees children who kill us?
Abdelhamid, Ibrahim, Mohamed, Ahmad - yes, those names are certainly French.
What does it mean that all these terrorists all believe in Islam?
How many white Europeans need to die before you dense fucks realize that Islam does not belong in Europe?
And heeeere we go.. 

/r/worldnews has its narrative and we're gonna move full steam ahead. 

All because we can pinpoint some group, call them xenophobes, stake out some moral high ground and feel great about how "egalitarian" we can all pretend to be. 

Fucking rote at this point.

Security be damned right? 

Syrian refugees aren't a problem right? Even though it's part of the **stated** MO of ISIS and groups like them.

Islam isn't a problem right? Even though hundreds of thousands of them (if not millions) are radicalizing at breakneck speeds and inflicting mass casualties on a whim.

Oh but:

&gt; The refugees are vetted!

By whom?! The same Syrian government that Western powers have been trying to undermine for upwards of about 3 years? Right. I don't see a problem with that plan at all!

Even if they come back clean on background checks, that just means they've managed to evade detection. I don't have a lot of faith in the legitimacy of the Syrian process in the first place - not to mention the likelihood of corruption in a country which is embroiled in CIVIL FUCKING WAR.

The fact that the French attackers are or aren't refugees is fucking moot. 

What everyone is really saying is:

&gt; We don't want them here.

..and for good reason.


The bigger issue, which I first read about in The Second World by Parag Khanna, are second generations of migrants from the Middle East and North Africa who have trouble acculturating and consequently become a source of unrest.

Taking in refugees could pose such an issue perhaps 30 years from now, but the short-term threat of confining them in Syria or Libya is likely far worse.
The article does not address the possibility that the terrorist used this passport through the entire process. I.E.: Used fake passport to transfer to France as a refugee, continued to use passport up until attacks. The article makes it seem like the passport must have been acquired after refugee status was established and they still don't know who this person is. It is possible that this person was a refugee with a false identity throughout the entire process.
...so stop giving EU passports to people from that part of the world *and* stop refugees from entering the country.  Look, as much as the bleeding-heart, PC, circle-jerk wants to say this debunks the idea that ISIS could use the refugee system to smuggle in militants, it really doesn't.  As far as I am concerned I would rather have the refugees risk death over their in Syria, than take the risk (and there is a risk) of having my own countrymen die because we let in the wrong people.  
This is an ongoing propaganda by the leftwing media. First of all, not all the suspects have been identified. One of the suicide bombers did in fact entered Europe as a refugee through Greece. If they were all European Muslim, it would have been much easier to identify them based on DNA. Anyway why would it make a difference whether they were mostly Syrians or Europeans? even if they are not radicalized now, we are only giving ISIS a bigger recruiting pool. http://news.yahoo.com/dead-killers-hunted-suspects-paris-attacks-100108618--business.html
isnt anyone suspicious that terrorist apparently always carry their passports with them when they execute an attack? their whole body gets ripped up BUT HEY, we found a passport!

bullshit, nice theatre.
I truly don't think we should blame the refugees, but I just gotta say: are we sure they aren't avoiding releasing that information because they don't want to incite violence?  
Yes , Muhammed Bin Terrorist is a traditional Belgian name. Come on, these trash are Muslims from the Middle East who got ahold of passports because of exactly this kind of fucking political correctness. 
Send them home with a bomb strapped to their chest just like they came. 
The issue aren't those refugees, it's the **LACK OF PROPER INTEGRATION POLICIES!**

My home town (Basel, Switzerland) has a ridiculously high % of foreigners...yet comparatively few issues. Why?

**Because we offer people good job/life perspectives!**

- Free language classes no matter which age you have. 

- Free education even if you're already 20 years old and technically too old for a "normal" education.

- Hire more teachers in areas with higher % of foreigners...because they obviously have it tougher at school.

The chap taking care of my parents' house came over from Kosovo a bit over 2 years ago and didn't speak a single word of German. Last time I visited, he greeted me with "Gruetzi, wie gohts?" in Swiss German. He's working hard and proudly told me he bought his family back home a car.

To those saying that costs more...recent studies (funny enough done by the cops) prove it's 7 times cheaper than facing more crime and higher unemployment requiring government assistance.

France and other countries fail HARD at this and create a 2 tier society where it's really hard for people to integrate. The good news is that they're (slowly) waking up because we just had a German and French delegation come over last month to learn about the integration system. 
they still aren't European 
Holy shit talk about immigrants, Reddit has taken in a bunch of dumbasses and racists all of a sudden.
ITT: terrorized cowards 
Why is religion even a thing? Fuck, it was (invented) so that people don't feel depressed haven't you noticed people who are into religion have lost a loved one or are approaching old age? Religion is just a human being self destruction. Just stop.
It seems to me that these bombers are more similar to angsty domestic teens and twenties terrorists like Timothy McVeigh or the Boston Bombers than militants from foreign nations.
Everyone has a EU passport.
Refugees good, terrorist bad. We get it media. 
All Muslim but not one named Mohammad. 
Please remember that if we deny access to a decent life for refugees we are pushing them back into the hands of ISIS and they are more than likely to have no choice but to be recruited to protect the safety of themselves/ their family. 

Let's not let these dickheads scare us, they won't win. 
can we just stop calling these people "masterminds"?
THAT MEANS THE REFUGEES DON'T BRING A MAJOR UPTICK IN CRIME RIGHT REDDIT?!!?
This simply tells bigots which one to hate on, refugees or muslim born citizens
This means the problem is a lot worse than we think it is. In reality, glass ceiling is everywhere in Europe. Not even NGOs and socialist parties will offer half of top management jobs in their own institutions for these people. Stop designating refugees like the future source of cheap labor, because it's an insult and a curse to their kids. I don't see white girls will be systematically dating some Arab rappers in slums. As refugees, their parents have hope. As slum dwellers on welfare rejected by majority of women and employers, they really don't mind turning society into hell for white women and employers.
The people you let in today as "refugees" are later the "terror suspects with EU passports."
It's absolutely ludicrous to see some journalists and activists trying to play down the refugee issue. Even if none of these terrorists are refugees, it doesn't matter. It is pretty obvious that ISIS infiltrated some cells in the refugee population simply because the refugee intake in Europe is out of control.  Most of the refugees are prime aged males, and some of them don't even come from Syria. It's a huge issue and any attempt to play it down will only cause more carnage. Recognize the problem and work on it. There are people there who need help, no doubt, but there is a problem that needs to be addressed. Stop this crazy intake and start the filtering process. 
Those are not traditional French names. 

I'd suggest that France's problem with immigration has been building for at least the past 30 years. And now they are natural born Frenchmen who still have a strong hatred for their host countrymen.
Does not matter if they were refugees or not. The point is that by offering refuge we are allowing them (terrorists) In to out countries as refugees.
Their parents were. Goes to show, we need to nip immigration in the bud now to prevent the rise of terrorists decades down the track
I hate news like this. It ignores the fact that refugees are openly terrorizing citizens with what means they DO have. Rape, violence, theft, etc.. Extremism doesn't require guns. Take an honest guess at what a good portion of the refugees would do if they were given guns. Unfortunately I'm sure popular opinion around here is dictated by people who choose not to look at the factual evidence and VIDEO evidence of what the refugees are doing.
Believing refugees entering europe would increase the chance of terror attacks is not rational at all. If someone actually wants to blow himself up he will find a way to get in. It might be slightly easier right now but it wasn't hard before and every european country says they want to improve the control over who enters and scan refugees better.

Still, it is really fucking easy to enter the EU and almost any other country if you want to. You cannot do anything against it but trying to fight the origin of the terror and having good intel.
Meaningless wordplay, and factually not entirely correct either.
[deleted]
Thank you for telling us, now we know that no Daesh will be among the refugees. Governments: trust worthy as the internet.
Any Catholics by any chance?
okay, but this doesn't cover the idea that they could have come from syria with the refugees whether they had EU passports or not...
Interesting. So on top of not letting refugees in we should remove all Arabs from White countries as well. 
Can someone explain how they know they were made in Turkey? I imagine there are other places to get a fake passport so unless they stamped "Made in Turkey" on the back I have a hard time understanding how they could possibly know where they came from.
Maybe hold off on the speculation.  Only one attacker has so far been identified and he was a French guy.  Remember the Egyptian passport found that turned out to belong to an injured bystander.  Go easy with the internet detectives and shitty sources.

Edit: now two more have been identified by authorities, neither of whom are Syrian refugees however. They are both French nationals who were living in Belgium. We don't know who the other five will turn out to be, but ludicrous speculation doesn't help any.
So people are either framing the refugees or they're not refugees at all. Sowing uncertainty and suspicion amongst the general populace.
Easy way to get into Europe - show a Syrian passport and claim to be a refugee.
Syrians passports are extremely easy to get a hold of. The Syrian Government pretty much set up shop in refugee camps and started selling them to anyone who has cash. You can basically walk in and pay with what ever cash you have, show a little paper work that says you are from Syria. Then walk out and start heading directly to Europe. It is that fast and easy. These are not fakes but legit passports. So are we really surprise that some members of ISIS have got their hands on them?

Edit#1 here for people asking for sources. [Syrian government relaxes rules for passports](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/27/syria-relaxes-passport-rules-lets-refugees-apply.html)

/r/titlegore
Is it common to keep your passport with you while you are terrorizing?  I usually leave mine at my hotel.
edit: it makes perfect sense to bring your passport with you. Stop upvoting me. 
Fellow Turkish redditor here,

Most of you probably already know that it is assumed that the our government is financially supporting ISIS. So it is quite possible that this might have "slipped by". And also there are known religious groups in Turkey that support ISIS. Althought they arent a lot, they could probably pull something like this off too.
That is a horrible title.
My friend who works at a passport place said months ago that syrian passports are basically drawn in crayon and are very easy to forge
Reminds me of the story about [Mossad agents who used fake Irish passports to enter Dubai and assassinate a Hamas official](http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0218/127737-dubai/).

Actually the passports were not fake, they had real numbers belonging to real Irish people. 
Why on earth would a suicide bomber have his passport on him anyway?! 

Got ma AK47.
Got ma suicide vest.
Oops, better pack my passport in case i get ID'd!
I see many people posting here the question about the passports that apparently some of the killers were carrying. Posibble explanation: In many Euro countries -- lots of others too! -- you need to carry a form of ID if you are stopped by police. Lots of immigrants in Europe don't have a car license nor yet have a national ID card. So they carry a passport so they can get through check points. Fake ones that "pass" for real just as good


I recall making a post recently on one of the links about Poland's qualms with accepting refugees, stating  caution as IS seemed to likely be baiting what were easily predicted responses. Responses meant to arouse certain obvious opinions towards the migrants crisis and migrants in general. Downvoted, per usual. Because the consensus was, "migrant found with passport, migrant crisis bad, down vote all who try to inject greyscske complexity into our binary morality." And I hate to go all circlejerk on people here, but while Reddit has reacted beautifully in it's support of the victims of the recent wave of extremist attacks, it has reached terribly in the face of news regarded the international reaction. Supporting violence in response to violence. Militant control of public reactions. So on and so forth.

I'm just going to avoid Reddit until this blows over I think. The comment s went from helpful to an depressing cherry on a shit sundae. 
where is the outrage over the huge lapse in French security during this whole event? Fake passports, terrorists on the 'watch list', catching a supposed terrorist 9 days before event. Big time intelligence failure.
How the fuck are passports and ID's always found at these ridiculous crime scenes?  These terrorists blew themselves up with grenades and supposedly a passport was found? A cabin burns through the night but we miraculously find an intact driver's license? A motherfucking plane hits the WTC and we find intact passports? 


Ether there's something rotten in Denmark or we need to start using passports as a building material,  maybe as bulletproof vests too 
I sometimes wonder if 'multicultural hope' is put at risk when one of the cultures involved is fuelled by a religiously-mandated belief in its supremacy over all other cultures?
jesus christ that fucking title
Hang with me on this one...but...

Is it too huge of a conspiracy to beleive that Turkey's media control wanted to silence Reddit to protect its citizens from seeing ties between the country and ISIS.  I mean think of it this way, either its a HUGE coincidence Turkey closes off its country's access to Reddit three days before its linked to this involvement with ISIS or maybe more likely that Turkey knew that one of its citizen's may be somehow directly/indirectly abetting terrorists and applied this form of damage control before it blew up in its face?
Understand, I say this sort of as a devil's advocate and because no one else is making or saying anything about this potential connection. I mean, I'm not one to either beleive in or agree with much conspiracy theories but I think its REALLY, REALLY odd timing for Turkey to just suddenly ban access to reddit and then its semi-defamed by association on the front page of the website just days later... Like, what other reasons could a country have to just ban a website that prior to now had said nothing against the country nor portraying the country negatively.  Aside the one I mentioned three times, I can't think of any; but maybe I am just too tunnel visioned on this idea and may be someone else could shed more light on what Turkey is doing with its wanton censorship of websites (As I'm assuming reddit is the only website that's restricted)?
Gee, I wonder why Turkey just amped up their internet censorship campaign...?
Probbably 90% of /r/worldnews will ignore that and keep distracting from Daesh by pointing at refugees.
This is an intriguing development.
Have you guys ever seen or played an indie game called papers please? Its really great and gives perspective on border issues and security like this that country's face. I found it on a reddit post and I'm sure there are posts that could give the game more justice in an explanation than me. Glory to Arstotzka!
There's always a passport 
West Germany has been letting in tens of thousands of muslim Turks since 1946.  You don't hear a peep out of any of them.
And the plot thickens... 
might be a stupid question but how could it be from the attackers? wouldn't it have blown up? 
Maybe hold off on the speculation.  Only one attacker has so far been identified and he was a French guy.  Remember the Egyptian passport found that turned out to belong to an injured bystander.  Go easy with the internet detectives and shitty sources.
It's really scary to think of how many 'fake' refugees can be in Europe right now... 
Canada should change its mind about taking refugees in
Inb4 ridiculous comments saying this was done to sow seeds of discord or make people blame the refugees. 

Migrants that go through Turkey often buy fake Syrian passports to be eligible for EU entry and benefits.  It costs less than 1000 euros. Sometimes it even comes included as part of travel package. 

[source] (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11880990/How-our-undercover-reporter-used-Facebook-to-arrange-fake-Syrian-passport-in-minutes.html) 
This just gives more strength to pro-immigration platform (which I am personally against in its current form).
Do passports not have high tech scanning verification systems?
sad thing about it is the refugees getting banned. If they can just do something about it the Paris attack might have been subdued
nobody hates new immigrants more than old immigrants?
Say goodbye to internet freedoms.  Surveillance advocates are going to run fucking wild with this one.
It reminds me of the passport they said they found in the World Trade Center rubble on September 11. 
Many Syrians have been buying fake passports even though they are actually Syrian. This is because it has become increasingly difficult to get actual passports in the war torn country where many of the government institutions are crippled. You can still get a passport but it can take quite a long time to get one as demand is so high and the institutions are in such disarray. People just want out of the country and into Europe so they settle for a fake passport from Turkey. 
Here is the part I don't understand, why are these terrorists carrying their passports (fake or otherwise) with them during the attack? Is it so that authorities can identify them? What purpose does that serve? Or is it to misguide? I still don't see the purpose because ISIS wants the recognition.
Why the hell would you carry a passport if you are going to blow yourself up? This is a really pathetic atempt to blame the syrians and get popular support to bomb assad. Are the people really that stupid to fall for this 1st grader scam?
The terrorists blow themselves up with suicide bombs but somehow the officials always find their passports. Remember the passports found from 9/11? Shady.
You can literally buy fake passports and IDs from almost anywhere on the street in Istanbul. They have little carts like hot dog venders with printers and laminators in them. I couldn't believe seeing them operating in the open like that
I think this was a false flag attack to bring us into another war.

edit: And I say this as a veteran who went over seas three times in 4 years. I came back absolutely devastated emotionally. Not because of the enmy but because I believe our government lied heavily and destroyed the lives of so many people for no reason other than money and military lobbyists. 

We can not allow emotions to bring us into another war. We need peace! 
/r/worldnews should stop speaking so highly of Turkey as this ideal place for refugees. Clearly, it can't be 100% trusted.
Probably nearly all the passports the 'legitimate' migrants had were fakes too I doubt the non existent government have been issuing them the last few years
Leaving a passport is probably a way of making the west blaming refugees. Blaming the people that flee from Daesh.. 
Funny how turkey blocked reddit immediately before this info became pukc
SJWs, Muslims, and Swedes yes finally caught a break. "See, this means it wasn't a refugee" or even better "False flag, Mossad, joos" they say. 

TENS OF THOUSANDS of "refugees" have fake Syrian passports. That's how they pass themselves off as refugees, you ignorant twats. 
Does no one actually read the articles?

They're just suspecting they were made in Turkey. This headline is wrong and dumb.
All of this terrible. Terrible for all people who lost their lives and loved ones and terrible for innocent people running from people who committed this and who now will be condemned as terrorists.
It doesn't matter! ... ISIS is a sequence of the blind support given by western governments to dictators in the Middle East!

Stop supporting those if you are serious to eradicate ISIS!
European leaders are utterly disgusting in betraying their citizens.

&gt;The president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, however, said on Sunday that Europe did not need to review its overall policies concerning refugees in the wake of the events.
And the plot thickens... 
How is turkey not in trouble. It seems as if they love isis.
Growing up, my parents monitored how much t.v I watched. When they thought I was watching to much they would turn it of and tell me either read a book, do chores, or go out and play. Until this day I still prefer to read books or hang out with friends. 

But more importantly, I wasn‘t hypnotized by the t.v. 

I can‘t believe all of the knee-jerk, racist, anti-muslim comments after this attack. It‘s like people don‘t even stop to think that we as a people are being lied to and manipulated from almost all sides of the spectrum of the sphere of the powers that may be. 

I‘m not claiming to have the ultimate answer, but what i‘m saying is that many to most people don‘t even ask questions anymore. They just hear or see something and take it as fact wthout any further thought or question. 

I‘m not sure if it was the intended purpose or side effect of watching too much t.v. but just take a look at what t.v. does to your brain.

http://themindunleashed.org/2015/08/how-tv-affects-your-brain-chemistry-for-the-worse.html

My theory is that they planted the Syrian passports on purpose. Let me explain. So with the refugees all coming from Syria recently....the public would force thw governments to turn back Syrians. This would cause the Syrians to get angry at the first world countries like Germany, etc. they would go back and join ISIS and fight for them. Its a way of recruitment i guess. 
[deleted]
The point is not that the passports were fabricated in Turkey - the point is that the Jihadist murderers gained entry as Refugees, since migrant checkpoints are totally overwhelmed with people, and the likelihood of a terrorist gaining entrance is much higher.
Easy way to get into Europe - show a Syrian passport and claim to be a refugee.
Middle East eye. Net where I get all my reliable French news.
Did they do it our way.
Eventually erdogan will be tried at the Hague. I will be a happy man when he does
I bet he didn't want to bring planes and trains down with big fireworks, when they could have been wrong, but that's based on what I last read.
According to the refugee/migrant crisis?
But it was never enough to fight for it, then there's no way they'll uphold it when we remove them from doing it?
"Don't judge a book by its cover." - instruction manual for every immigration checkpoint.  Likely The metal ink used in the cover labels is different according to source, also the fabric of the cover, and dye lots of the covers, even fabric of the stitches of the pages and cut marks of the boundaries of the paper. And it smelled like terrorism.
&gt; EU commission chief says EU does not need to review migration policy in light of fears that militants posing as refugees launched attacks

No, you got it wrong. The fear is that militants posing as refugees WILL launch further attacks.
In İstanbul you can find anything you want. 
Do fake passport still works? I thought since everything is digitalised they can't really fake them anymore. I would've thought a fake passport would be flagged instantly at passport control simply because it doesn't exist?
Interesting times ahead!
TITLE GORE!
This title gives me a headache 
My mom was in europe a few months back, and one of her friends volunteers to help the refugees that are going through the area, and one of them told her friend how they are only there to kill people....

No not all of the refugees are ISIS, but mixed in with the good you have the bad and they are spreading through europe... Let's see if something happens in Germany Next since they probably accepted the most people....
Why would they even want a Syrian passport? Wouldn't a French passport let them get to France quicker?
I bet they also found an official contract between these terrorists and Assad.
ELI5: What is the significance of this coming from turkey?

Just want to point out I know it is important I just dont know why.
Learn to copy paste
But was it used to enter Europe now?
what now john oliver?
Meanwhile I wonder how many fake Syrians have gotten trough or will get trough the numerous asylum processes in different European countries. 

Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, West Africans and many more that should not be here. 
Yeah not surprising. Since Turkey wants no more refugees. They are one of the ones helping refugees even knowing they are ISIS coming into Europe and smuggling people. 
we need to train the employees with papers please.
"A Dutch journalist reported in September that he had bought a fake Syrian passport and ID card, both bearing the picture of the Dutch prime minister, for $825."
Forensic document analysis is a big deal in countries that people try to sneak into frequently. 
That photo of a Syrian passport has "[stick people] (http://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/main_image_article_page/public/main-images/000_Nic6267817.jpg)" drawn on it. Properly the easiest thing to fake!
Had to read the title a few times.
Any evidence these attacks were staged by agent provocateurs?
How do you stop an army like that so hell bent on terrorizing? How do you stop them from recruiting people and getting them to blow themselves up in crowded places and shooting random people in countries all over the world? I'm being serious, what do the world leaders plan on doing about this? How do you prevent this random chaos? Kill all their leaders one by one and hope they all just eventually give up? I feel like this shit will never stop.
It's amazing that these terrorists always have their passports with them. 
Worst stuffing ever.
Many of refugees coming into Europe are from countries other than Syria posing as Syrian refugees in order to gain access to the opportunities there.  While the Syrian passport does not indicate that the attacker was Syrian, it does strongly suggest that the person posed as a Syrian refugee or claimed to be from Syria to gain some advantage.
The real question is, can Syrian passports survive melting steel?
Sultan Erdogan approves this article.
It was clear from the beginning 
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syrian-passports-found-scene-paris-attacks-fakes-made-turkey-police-520642631) reduced by 85%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; Syrian passports found near the bodies of two of the suspected Paris attackers were fakes that were likely made in Turkey, police sources in France told Channel 4 News on Sunday.

&gt; In addition to the Syrian documents discovered at the scene of the Paris assaults, media reports suggested that an Egyptian passport discovered near the Stade de France - which was targeted by two suicide bombers on Friday - belonged to one of the attackers.

&gt; &amp;quot;Those who organised the attacks are the very same people who the refugees are fleeing and not the opposite,&amp;quot; Juncker told reporters in Turkey as he prepared to attend a G20 summit, which in light of the Paris attacks that came a day after large attacks in Beirut and Baghdad is expected to focus on security.

Isn't Obama In Turkey right now? Conspiracy?
Does it seem strange that the report says that the fake passports were lying near the bodies? Those things always seem to drop at the perfect time and place.
It's to point finger at the east 
Mass "Syrian" migration is still a good idea. 
Wait, so the terrorists got in with fake passports, but officials don't see a need to review policy?

I dunno maybe they should be SCREENING MORE CLOSELY FOR PHONY PASSPORTS
why in the hell would they be carrying passports? Im assuming they wouldnt come straight from the boarder.

Islam has been at war with the west for 13 centuries

Jefferson, Churchill, Hitler, they all acknowledged Islam as being a perfect ideology to wage war with.




Churchill on Islam:

&gt;"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries, improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. 

&gt;A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement, the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property, either as a child, a wife, or a concubine, must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. 

&gt;Individual Muslims may show splendid qualities, but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilization of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilization of ancient Rome. "


Jefferson on Islam:


&gt;"It was written in their Koran, that all nations which had not acknowledged the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave; and that every Mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise. He said, also, that the man who was the first to board a vessel had one slave over and above his share, and that when they sprang to the deck of an enemy's ship, every sailor held a dagger in each hand and a third in his mouth; which usually struck such terror into the foe that they cried out for quarter at once."



Hitler on Islam:


&gt;"Had Charles Martel not been victorious at Poitiers -already, you see, the world had already fallen into the hands of the Jews, so gutless a thing Christianity! -then we should in all probability have been converted to Mohammedanism [Islam], that cult which glorifies the heroism and which opens up the seventh Heaven to the bold warrior alone. Then the Germanic races would have conquered the world. Christianity alone prevented them from doing so."

&gt;"You see, it's been our misfortune to have the wrong religion. Why didn't we have the religion of the Japanese, who regard sacrifice for the Fatherland as the highest good? The Mohammedan religion [Islam] too would have been more compatible to us than Christianity. Why did it have to be Christianity with its meekness and flabbiness?"

Islamophobia means an irrational fear, this fear is VERY rational
Why did they take their passports to a massacre?
I told you. Nobody believed me. 
Finally. A chance to involve Turkey in all the shenanigans and bomb them too. It's amazing how passports survived 911 and suicide bombing in France. Amazing. 
I've read something like this once the Syrian refugee crisis started. Some dude in Turkey sells fake passports to people, including to Isis terrorists who seek to sneak into Europe. This is really fucked up, since he might not be the only one doing this, and with the thousands of refugees that flooded Germany, it's only a matter of time until this will happen again in another city... fuck those guys!
Where are all the people who want Turkey to join the EU?  Does that still seem like a good idea to *anyone*?
Are people really surprised by this?
I think it's funny this article has a disclaimer "French police reports." I don't know who people expect to report on this other than the French police. Sorry it doesn't fit in with your anti-refugee narrative... 
/r/TitleGore
Why is turkey a member of nato? They don't crack down on terrorism at all
of course they were fake only a moron wouldn't get that 80% of those passports are fake


Doesn't Turkey openly support ISIS? I remember reading something months ago about some trucks the Turkish government was giving to ISIS.. or something about trucks and ISIS and the Turkish government. Google did not help. 
What a poorly edited headline.
so nsa? what the fuck you doing 
What would they be carrying passports during the attack?
But like why would the attackers carry fake passports to the scene of the crime? Seems like something you'd leave at home that day
France should makeover refugees as French Foreign Legion fighters and send them back to free their homes. jk?
Can someone explain to my WHY THE DUCK A TERRORIST WOULD BE WALKING WITH THEIR PASSPORT?! Just doesn't make any sense to me...
[ISIS sends 4000 jihadis to europe](http://www.westernjournalism.com/islamic-state-uses-refugee-crisis-to-smuggle-4000-jihadist-gunmen-into-europe/)     
8 dead. 3992 to go.
maybe, just maybe, opening the flood gates to a group of people with an indefinite history or past is a bad idea.

hey angela merkel, immigration procedures exist for a reason.  you cant just let waves of random people in without background checks or ANY consideration to who they are and if they might be a threat.  perhaps it would be best to treat syria as a containment zone, rather than letting the plague of radical extremists spread further.

hey, I feel bad for actual, innocent refugees.  but there are inevitably going to be bad apples among the good ones that are let in, exploiting the situation.
Anyone else see it as convenient and "baiting" to leave the passports at the scene of the crime?
When I go shoot up a place I usually bring a passport with me too. Yes. Of course.
I don't understand why European nations are just letting refugees wander around without proper investigation ... And know I hear Canada is becoming a transfer point for refugees... Great just open up the rest of North America for attack... Not saying all Syrian refugees are bad but they (ISIS) are exploiting the openess of these countries to attack I wouldn't be surprised if more attacks occur
[deleted]
They dropped their passports? What? 
And the borders are still open to these savages.  The blood is on the hands of left wing Europe. 
As soon as they reported that there were passports found on Paris attackers you just knew it was on purpose. Let's review a few scenarios...

1) Gonna go rob a bank - better make sure to carry my passport

2) Gonna go commit a murder - better make sure to carry my passport

3) Gonna go commit a world wide, rage inducing despicable act - better make sure to carry my passport

I mean really? No one suspects that as f'n suspicious in the slightest?
This proves that Europe shouldnt let ABYBODY IN ANYMORE
Conspiracy theory time? It's a false flag operation by Russia, just like they have been doing inside Russia for years. They are trying to drag the west into Syrian war on Russia's terms, to make Putin seem strong, to shore up domestic support.
Looks like jumping to racist conclusions based on religion is not actually a good way to get the facts.
Let's cram our rule by corporation and the almighty dollar down the throats of those mooslem bastards. We must continue to topple dictators. No government by religion!
lol they found the passports AGAIN? 9/11, charlie hebdo, now this? So terrorists carry their passports when attacking, alright then
I thought it was weird that they would have passports on them at all during a "mission."
Why would a terrorist bring his passport with him when he's about to kill himself? And how did the passport even survive the explosions and the fire? 
The wolves have dressed as the sheep in order to get into the flock. 
That wasn't obvious from the start? honestly I'd expect this stupidity from reddit/4chan/twitter, but from police/detectives/government? not sure what to think anymore.
Why did they take passports to their death, don't forget a towel and toothbrush? How many countries were stamped on that passport?
I never understood why a terrorist planning a strike for maybe months would deliberately carry a genuine passport with him during the execution of the attack? 

Can someone do a ELI5 for me?
Looks like it took two days for liberals to fall back to their spineless policies. 

Time to roll out the red carpet for the next muslim terrorist. The French people are suicidal.
Why do left wingers desperately try to defend this atrocity? This is an act of war, they must die or we will.
Why is Europe letting in non Europeans in? 

Its a culture clash.
Good job Merkel.  Even if only .1% to 0.01% of the 1,000,000 immigrants you just let in are terrorists, that's still enough for an army of a small size and enough to kill thousands of people.  

Europe, you're fucked...and all in the name of 'tolerance', 'multiculturalism', and for fear of PC.  
than why bomb syria and not turkey?
Keep in mind that Patriot Act was written before 9/11, and virtually all military action (at least by US) is precipitated by a false flag event.

All this reeks of BS, &amp; we're being played.  Anyone think the terrorists actually think they're about to scare the rest of us into doing whatever it is claimed they want?  Like we'll find them so frightening that we won't want to retaliate?  Fuck no!  We all want blood after this type of thing!  ....or does it seem more likely that these events are done to piss us all off, be ok with violating/murdering others, and relinquishing anything &amp; everything to the Dominion?  It reminds me of the exchange in War Games:

    General, are you prepared to destroy the enemy?

    You betcha!

    Do you think they know that?

    I believe we've made that clear enough.

    Then... don't.

Don't enlist to go kill people, and don't roll over &amp; give up your rights for the illusion of security.  I suspect that this attack, and ISIS itself, may be a false flag event.  Figure out who is truly responsible &amp; charge everyone remotely involved with war crimes, &amp;/or crimes against humanity.

I'm so sick of this shit.
Damnit I wish I was brown then I could just get a fake Syrian passport and claim asylum in Sweden and live a life of luxury.
damn this shit is looking like a set up. kill a bunch of innocents and make it look like it was syrians that did it??
Interesting that Turkey is also hosting the ~~G20~~ G19.
It's a good thing most of the major world leaders are in Turkey. For sure they will be able to solve the case of the fake passports. 
You should not be surprised. Fake IDs are sold in Turkey, Bulgaria and other transit countries. There are gangs that operate this trade. There was an investigation about it few months ago. Turkish government chooses to ignore this because I'm guessing some politicians are getting their cut. It has to be a multi-billion dollar business now. Imagine millions of refugees in Turkey trying to get a fake Syrian passport for $1000 a piece.
bring a bunch of broken toys into your country and bad things happen. 
What's up with terrorists always dropping their passports?
The question is why were they carrying their passports with them ? It's clear that they wanted the passports to be found and identified then
It was from silkroad
I have a feeling this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The thing Muslims need is better leadership, just about all of their problems can be linked to poor/absent leadership. And you can't blame anyone other than their own, I don't want to hear "Oh but the U.S. toppled all of our leaders". Bullshit, if you had leadership this wouldn't happen. I don't blame the corporations for infiltrating and controlling our government (it's a natural instinct to do what it takes to gain control), I blame the people in charge that allowed it to happen.
Can't wait for Trudeau to let all these fake passport using terrorsits into Canada. This country has fucked itself and it would almost be funny if my family and I weren't being put at risk. 
Mhmm.. sure it was
I think it's time to start working on digitally-signed passports. Make them like we have SSL Certificates. You read the info, scan the QR-CODE, verify it at some Syrian embassy network services, and voila.

If there's an irregularity, you could just revoke said certificates and render the passports invalid.

The catch is how to get Syria, in its current state, to get the infrastructure to embed this digital info in their passports.
By "found" how did they come about them??    Dropped?  Or taken from terrorist at the scene??  Sorry if dumb quiestion!
Which terrorist would be stupid enough to bring his passport to the scene? I mean, come on...
Ever notice the passports don't burn in the explosion?
Gladio-B. A few more pieces fall into place and we have a Turkey sponsored, indirectly a NATO sponsored, false flag attack. 
Imagine that.
I don't get it, how are these passports found after the terrorists blew themselves up? Weren't the passports with them?
I said to my wife the minute this was reported, 'Who takes a passport to a suicide bombing? Those were totally planted.'  I couldn't even figure out *why* they would be planted, it just didn't add up.

My guess is ISIS's local supporters are trying to make good on ISIS's promise to send suicide bombers with the refugees, thus scaring the west into shutting down the flow, giving them more people to screw with, and hastening the apocalyptic showdown they seem to want to have at Dafiq.  

I am all for giving them that showdown too.  Open fields, nowhere to hide, versus the militaries of all the sane peoples of the world.  Where do we sign up?
Wait, when they say attackers do they mean the suicide bombers? How could they have found passports? o_O
r/titlegore
Nobody seems to have asked this. How can a passport survive a bomb blast?? Only asking as my wall is full of conspiracy posts. (Anyone a bomb expert on here??)
Muhammed or McLovin?
&gt;Mostefai’s recent movements have not yet been made public, although British intelligence officials have said the attackers were part of a cell that recently returned from fighting in Syria.

http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/syrian-passports-found-scene-paris-attacks-fakes-made-turkey-police-520642631

Hmmm... that sounds like an admission that the British/French government knew these guys were terrorists, but did nothing to stop them coming back to France. 


Turkeys government is basically ISIL with suits considering they have armed and transported them around. Probably made by Turkeys intelligence service. 
Isis is a tool of the US. They find this passport in france and discover it's fake. I wonder why the passport they supposedly found on the ground of NYC on 9/11 which supposedly belonged to one of the hijackers(does anyone really believe that shit?), was never examined independently. If it were I'd bet they find the same result. Our government is corrupt as fuck.  Don't underestimate them.
Ha ha ha. Its so blatantly obvious what's happening. Its hilarious reading all these idiots falling for it yet again.
Hundreds of people are slaughter every day in Syria like sheep by the regime why the west hasn't  made "peace for Syria" ?? 

The Russian plane carried 200+ people why Twitter,YouTube,snapchat didn't the Russian flag ?

Israel prison hundreds of normal Arab citizens everyday? WhAt about them

Fuck this hypocrite World.


http://leemarej.deviantart.com/art/media-truth-572322548



Fuck this fake peace. After France killed more than 300+ civilian by airstrike Syria and Iraq they got what the deserve. When the west stop supporting dictators and stop bombing the rest of the world terrorism will stop. 

Btw France is one of the most brutal countries in human history. They murderd over 50+ million people in the last 200 years.


"hey Ahmed, lets go bomb this place. But first, lets make sure we all have our ID's and Passports! Maybe we should tattoo our social security numbers on our arms too"

really guys?
Lovely
Yeah all these 'refugee' fuckers are carry suspiciously brand new passports.
That's like saying, "guns used at the scene of the crime were made in germany, showing that germany was involved in the attacks." 
Can someone remind to me why turkey is still in nato when erdogan is obliviously supporting islamists since years ?

Regarding Syrian refugees: Maybe it's time to recognize that the moderate, freedom loving Syrian people deserve another option. Maybe now the entire world is so disgusted by everything that's transpired, to include other middle eastern nations, in fact calling out other middle eastern nations specifically, we can have some kind of multinational worldwide intervention in the reason.

Obviously, as long as Al Asad is in power, ISIS will be the counterweight. They *both* suck. Nothing good comes from either. This region deserves a reckoning of the extremes. We need to, collectively, do good by the peaceful people of this land. They deserve to enjoy the freedoms the rest of us deserve. Or at least they deserve to get to pick a leader that won't gas them and bombard them with artillery if and when they call for him to step down.

Furthermore, stomping both Al Asad as well as ISIS, we will likely be able to stymie the flow of refugees into the rest of the world. The overwhelming majority of war refugees want safety and security and peace for themselves and their families. Surely we can understand that. And surely we can understand that anything short of that means prolonging the problem of terror.

Great. Now it seems likeal-Qaeda and Daesh are starting a 'Who's the better terrorist'-competition. Fuck me.
I hope this shit doesn't spill over to where I live now as an American. I'm living in Mindanao Philippines which has a large Muslim population. There was just a bomb that exploded in a van at our local mall a few days ago. 
Damnit, this is going to be bad. If we want combat these people, we have to lose the 'BOMB THEM' hysteria and demand answers as to where their funding and arms are coming from. Whose buying their oil, what banks are they using, how are they transferring funds? No more faux bullshit.
It fucks me off that these bellends never target anyone who can fight back.

This type of terrorism is to send a message to the world: Convert to Islam or die. Fear is their tools to get nonbelievers to memorize the parts of Quran. As soon as people see this in the news and start pulling out Quran verses to study, they have won.
Reading the live update of Mali soldiers storming the hotel, combined with rumors of suicide belts and 150+ hostages made my stomach sink. I hope that this doesn't end how I'm afraid it will...

Also, this is the best live blog of the attacks.
As of 30 minutes ago, 138 people are still inside, even after the hostage release.
Who is funding them, who is buying their oil, what bank are they using, how are they transferring funds, who are they buying weapons from. With the entire world focused on this there is no reason we can't get answers enough with this faux bombing campaign against vacant trucks nicely lined up in the middle of the desert.

&gt;'I saw bullets on the floor'
Michael Skapoullis, a man who lives near the Radisson Blu, told CNN he was using the hotel's gym Friday morning when he noticed fellow exercisers leaving. He hadn't heard anything because he was listening to music, but he decided to follow.

&gt;He walked to a door leading to the hotel lobby, and that's when he saw something was wrong.

&gt;"I saw bullets on the floor of the lobby," Skapoullis said. "So I gently closed the door, and ... I went back into the gym" and eventually left the complex.

That is the luckiest guy in the world right now.

"There is no global pattern of jihadi terrorism." - entire internet just a week ago. 
UN counts 27 bodies as hostage situation ends

Edit: There is a very clear theme: radical Islam is using violence to kill people. Their goal is to eradicate Western values and impose their version of Islamic Law. This attack appears to involve remnants of Al-Qaeda, the Paris attacks involved ISIS, but the underlying motivation is the same: Radical Islam.

We must have the courage to call out the people who kill in the name of their religion. When will our leaders have the courage to do that? How many innocent lives will be sacrificed before they have the courage to stand up to evil?

Another peaceful day in countries infected with this brand of Islam.

Sky News live feed: http://news.sky.com/watch-live
Mirror says: A vehicle was used to smash through a security barrier at 7am this morning, according to reports. 

So maybe the story about them staying there last night was false. Who knows at this point.

http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mali-radisson-hotel-siege-live-6865679#1
"Gunmen have stormed a hotel in Mali and taken 170 people hostage in an apparent terror attack.

Around 10 gunmen entered the Radisson Blu in the capital Bamako, shooting and screaming "Allahu Akbar", which means "God Is great" in Arabic."
Sky News
One might think release of hostages gives reason for hope, but it's possible (probable) they're looking for specific people (e.g. non-Muslims) and are just gonna kill those.
do we have a live thread on this situation right now ?!
Does anyone else think that thing on the ground covered in brown tarp might be a body? Everyone is taking care to avoid stepping on it and the shape looks like a foot and leg.
Statement from the hotel group:

&gt; Our highest concern is the safety of all our guests and employees in the hotel. We are in constant contact with the authorities there and will share further information with you when we have it.

&gt; We have established dedicated phone lines to support the families of guests and employees, as well as a media enquiry line. Please refer to the numbers below.

18 BODIES RECOVERED FROM MALI HOTEL: AFP CITES SECURITY SOURCE
Just got a breaking news notification from BBC - no more hostages: Mali hotel attack: 'No more hostages' after special forces raid - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34879955

The BBC have definitely covered this well since this started.
27 lives lost just a week after that horrendous incident in Paris. What has the world come to?!  My heart breaks for those victims nobody deserves to die like that. 


for fuck's sake with these assholes. 
Supposedly a group of chinese tourists in the hotel. Shits about to get real with the EU, China, USA, and Russia all sharing a common enemy. 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-34877069?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_breaking&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_linkname=news_central English report (Will be updated)
Anyone have a translation or summary?
im getting sick of these fucking muslim murdering everyone
Chinese media is reporting that several Chinese guests are among those held hostage
Must be those Buddhists again...
[deleted]
Can't wait for that fucking "terrorismhasnoreligion" hashtag to start trending after this while white people on twitter post things like "1.5 billion Muslims are condemning this right now!!". 
The sheer naivety and ignorance would make you laugh if it wasn't so dangerous.
[deleted]
I am in Bamako, three blocks away.  It is very quiet.  You can bet that every bit of US, UN, French and Malian armament in the country is there.   We are hearing that there are just two gunmen, and that several people are holed up, not being held.    It'd be kind of helpful to hold back on dire predictions just now....

We're going to need another reddit live update thread going. This looks bad.
Fucking hell can't we go a week without anyone causing trouble.
[From the live thread:](https://www.reddit.com/live/vy6s4l4iz5mp)

"Mali hotel gunmen free some hostages, including those able to recite verses of the Koran"

&gt;A Malian security source said the attackers returned to the enclosure of the hotel aboard a car with a diplomatic plate.

wow
CNN: Special forces raid on hotel began an hour and fifteen minutes ago
We should send phrases of the quran to the hostages so they can say them and get released.
I think some local journalist just said on sky news there is another attack at a different hotel now (I think) 
Live YouTube feed:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y60wDzZt8yg
If they're Ansar Al-Din then that rules out ISIS. They're not exactly fond of each other.
A quick translation is that nearly 200 people are being held hostage in a hotel that houses mostly foreigners.
BBC reporting at least 3 people have been killed. Thoughts go to their families :/
How in the hell did they get diplomatic plates?
Guests at hotel are reported to be from nations all over the world. Chinese, French, Belgian, Indian, Nigerian, Moroccan. /u/antihexe
Good twitter [feed] (https://twitter.com/Terror_Monitor) to see live updates.  Someone earlier posted it...
80 hostages freed. Good job on the rapid response 
What's this about the attackers speaking English? Is this still to be confirmed?
Apparently there was already 25 U.S. special forces nearby for some reason and they have been seen moving people to safety.


So...were the three people killed during the initial raid on the hotel, or when the police raided it?
I dont get why they didnt tell people to stop reporting and twitting the police activity. Seriously, its public, why would you want the terrorists to know.
"No more hostages are being held. /u/antihexe"
"18 people have been killed, and there are no more hostages being held, this does not however mean that the siege is over". 
Is it common for people in this area to speak English?  I'm just curious, it was one part o the live feed that I didn't expect to see, and being reported multiple times. 

"'According to people who have fled the hotel, the assailants speak English.'-Jeune Afrique News [translated] /u/antihexe"
U.N. peacekeepers at Mali hotel saw 27 bodies; search of hotel continues
Is Facebook enabling that "I'm safe"  option 
So everywhere I look just says the hostages are all free but doesn't say anything about what happened to the terrorists.  It's weird how crazy its driving me. 
I wonder what religion the gunmen are
Do we all put a transparent Malian flag over our profile pictures now?
damn, the apologists didn't even get 1 week to spread their lies
http://s21.postimg.org/8qj2k03vb/IMG_20130610_WA0004.jpg
&gt; Reports assailants wearing suicide belts.

The fact that there's something called a "suicide belt" is disturbing enough on its own. Shit's fucked up these days. All we can do is hope for the best, I guess.
My impression is that the security forces were impressively quick to storm the hotel.
No messing about negotiating with madmen, just kick the door in and start blowing them away.

Hopefully not too many hostages will get killed in the process.


Is this retaliation from Al Qaeda because no one is paying any attention to them?
I don't understand the comments like "I can't believe this is happening again!" There are terrorist attacks literally every day in other countries. Nigeria, Iraq. An 11 year old girl blew herself up a couple days ago and killed 30 something people. 
Drunk at 5AM, about to go to bed, guess I'll check /r/all real quick before I fall asleep.

Greeted with this shit.

Going to be a long night/morning...
Were they Amish or Mormon? Never mind. 
Another day, another terrorist attack from Islam.  
Fucking daesh pieces of shits. All these cowards can do is attack unprepared and unprotected civilians. Also fuck every islam apologist.
The fucked up thing is that many Muslims who speak out about Islam is they will be ostracized and threatened, and potentially physically abused because of it. Even in western countries. The only fundamental problem with Islam is that you cannot question it. This causes extremism... They can write as many violent verses as they want in the Quran and any sane person will say, hey that's not right. When you face threats for saying that though, you keep your mouth shut and look away. As sad as this is for Muslims, the fact that nothing has been done within the Muslim world to change this about Islam is as much their problem as our meddling in the middle east. 
Sorry Muslims, I like you but I despise your religion Islam. Seriously, it's violent (please don't tell me its peaceful by reciting out of context phrases), barbaric and completely out of touch. 

Look I dont give a shit what happens inside a mosque or a temple or a church. Don't kill people like this!

EDIT: Sorry I don't mean to say that every Muslim is to blame for this. 
Fuck ALLAH.
Reports from local media are claiming that the gunmen spent the night in the hotel.

It is understood that grenades were used by them this morning.

10 gunmen are believed to be inside the building.

http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mali-radisson-hotel-siege-live-6865679#1
Today seems like a good day for hollow points.
Jesus Christ, not again...
All hostages rescued, confirmed by Security Minister of Mali. A total of 22 dead bodies has been found inside the Radisson Blu hotel. 
shouting Allahu Akbar, releasing only hostages that can recite the Quran. #NotTrueMuslims
Not every islamic terrorist attack is fucking ISIS. Why do people not understand this?! 
Once again... http://i.imgur.com/1Qfa4yr.jpg
Muslims again?
Please be careful of Islamophobic comments everyone. Don't criticize Islam's ideology because that's racist. Thanks. :D
&gt; [The Chinese state news agency Xinhua said several Chinese tourists were among those trapped inside the building.](http://news.yahoo.com/gunmen-attack-luxury-hotel-mali-capital-hostages-084238110.html)

See what they did to your people China? It's time to strike back!


10 Chinese citizens are among the hostages trapped inside hotel in Bamako, Mali, embassy says - @cctvnews https://twitter.com/cctvnews


**THESE IDIOTS JUST FUCKED WITH ANOTHER SUPERPOWER.**
Yippee it's back
Ah fuck. I can't believe they've done this. 
Not in English. What a terrible crime. Truly, a black mark against the only acceptable language in the world. How dare worldwide news not be in English?

...

/s
Dude fuck that. I'm not reciting shit from the quran. You spineless taints need to grow a pair. Saying "oh now I'm going to read the quaran just in case I ever need it." ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME! THATS WHAT THEY WANT. FORCING THERE SHIT DOWN YOUR THROAT. LITERALLY. what you spineless fucks need to do is recite Austin 3:16 on their candy asses and stone cold stun there asses back into the holes they crawled out of. That will send their asses a message. Asses. 
Muslim retards strike again. And again. And again....  I wish you could bomb an idea.
Ah yes, more batshit crazy Muslims.  What a surprise!! You'll learn one day. 
Two attackers:

Looks like a nice hotel, especially for Mali: https://www.radissonblu.com/en/hotel-bamako
oh ffs, please not again...
In a globalized world with almost instantaneous universal access to mass media, it's now become so easy for terrorists to broadcast their atrocities around the globe. I wonder if there's a way to combat this from the technology side of the equation.
One report that hostages include Air France staff:

If they've released people able to recite passages of the Quran, would it be likely that they are already killing the people that can't? Like IS do in Raqqa?
To take 140 hotel guests and 30 staff hostage they had to know what they were doing
kinda.... giving up on the future of humanity.

And the news is just regurgitating details about the recent raid in France.
Damn, GIGN are really having their work cut out for them.

Hey /u/braintrustinc,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Did there happen to be US Special Forces already in the hotel or were they luckily in the vicinity?
With me living and working next door in Senegal,  things that happen in Mali always have me a bit worried.  
from the live thread

&gt;UN forces were reportedly holding an event/meeting at the hotel." -IBTimes 

Interesting...
Does anyone know what their demands are?
so do they have any demands?
&gt; Sky News Live speculating that the group suspected responsible, Ansar al-Din, probably does not have connections to ISIS directly. 

From the live thread
skynews just reported 80 hostages just released. i doubt it's IS.
Any idea how good the Malian special forces/hostage rescue teams are?

I mean, they showed up in a beat-up Toyota pickup. But other than that.
These "people" (terrorists) need to be exterminated like the cock roaches they are.
oh no. this is going to end poorly.
Fucking hell, not again.

Most analysis on the news agencies seems to be saying this is a local organization unlikely to be directly related to IS.
Media still saying no further news.

[Live Streaming Hostage Situation &amp; Explosions @ Radisson Hotel in Bamako, Mali](http://yoetu.be/watch/y60wDzZt8yg)
These terrorists are pretty bad.  Hostages slipping away left and right. 
Seems to be taking an awfully long time, no?
&gt; When Palestinian artist Ashraf Fayadh​ was tried last year on blasphemy-related charges, the Saudi judges overseeing the case rejected the prosecution's request for a death sentence for apostasy. Instead, **he was sentenced to 800 lashes and four years in prison** over a book of poetry he wrote and for allegedly having illicit relations with women.

&gt; **An appeal was filed** and the case was sent back to the lower court, but this time around judges threw out defence witness testimony, refused to accept Mr Fayadh's repentance and **on November 17 sentenced him to execution for apostasy.**

Disregarding the stupidly high punishments, I think they're doing appeals about 500% wrong in Saudi Arabia.
This is ISIS-like
Outstanding work by UN Human Rights Panel Member Saudi Arabia. A true beacon for the rest of the world.
See, this is the same kind of thing DAESH does.  Really, what is the difference between the Islam of Daesh and the Islam of Saudi Arabia?  Absolutely - nothing!
Why are we selling these maniacs billions in weapons?
What a shit country. 
FUCK Saudi Arabia!!
\#SaudiArabiaIsDaesh

Edit: Proper hash tagging.
This is a fucking atrocity. I'm glad I wasn't born in Saudi Arabia . . . 
Fuck Saudi Arabia 
&gt;Mr Fayadh's friends had submitted testimony disputing the veracity of a complaint filed to the religious police by an acquaintance who **accused** him of making blasphemous comments about God, the prophet Muhammad and the Saudi state

So basically sent to death on heresay. k.
It disgusts me to think my countries government (the UK) is allied with these barbaric bastards
"Outraged? I’m barely surprised. This is a country where women aren’t allowed to drive a car. They’re not allowed to be in the company of any man other than a close relative. They’re required to adhere to a dress code that would make a Maryknoll nun look like Malibu Barbie. They beheaded 121 people last year for robbery, rape, and drug trafficking. No free press, no elected government, no political parties. And the royal family allows the religious police to travel in groups of six, carrying nightsticks, and they freely and publicly beat women. But ‘Brutus is an honorable man.’ Seventeen schoolgirls were forced to burn alive because they weren’t wearing the proper clothing. Am I outraged? No, Steve. No, Chris. No, Mark. That is Saudi Arabia, our partners in peace.”" 

-CJ Cregg.
**Because your god is afraid of competition..**
lol god, Sharia is such a steaming pile of shit.  
&gt;Sentenced to death for atheism

If this doesn't sound like the middle ages then I don't know what does. 
and the U.S supports and funds these extremists.
And Saudi Arabia is different from ISIS how?
ISIS that you ? 
Hey Saudi Arabia why don't you just send all your atheists to Europe/North America and in return you take all the Islamic refugees from Syria. Its fucking ridiculous that they enforce laws like this, when the super rich saudi's come to Europe/U.S. to do everything they would be put to death for back home. Then return home only to support this bullshit. You don't see Saudi Arabia executing any of its princes for breaking sharia law.
Where does IS get the ideas for their shit? Oh, wait, Saudi is IS lite, isn't it.
Good old Saudi Arabia, head of the UN Human Rights Council. The UN also says Israel is the worst violator of human rights. This is some Alice in Wonderland type shit. 
ISIS = Saudi Arabia
How on earth do we still have theocracies? 
Saudi Arabia knows a thing or 2 about human rights... oh wait..
Nice people over there. 
it's remarkable that these barbarians are allies of the west. Dont believe in our imaginary god? We will kill you.
The P in Islam stands for Peace.
The only reason similar things don't happen is Europe is because the muslim population doesn't make up enough of the population ... yet.  The countries with the highest percentage muslim populations are also the worst countries in the world.

People welcoming the Islamisation of their countries are welcoming this too, only it will be your grandchildren who will experience it.
How Daesh of you Saudi Arabia. It's time for the kafir to rise up. SA can eat shit.
Always nice to see things like this. Why dont we just kill everyone because of some made up bullshit so this is all over.
Once we solve climate change, this will never happen again
Wait...so he is Palestinian.  They are executing a non-citizen?
But they're totally different from ISIS.
Can we please, *please* stop supporting this country?
lol Saudi arabia is just isis but green.
Religion is stupid. Practice good humanity.
The US and Europe need to stop supporting Saudi Arabia.
This is the same Saudi Arabia that leads the UN's human rights council?
These assholes with their prehistoric idealism need to be removed from the face of the earth. The world is growing and changing, move with it. Disgusting. 
[The human rights council of the UN,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council) the UNHRC is "responsible for promoting and protecting human rights around the world."

How seriously does the KSA treat human rights?

https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2015/country-chapters/saudi-arabia

https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/saudi-arabia/

edit- oh yeah, the KSA is on the UNHRC and they continue to do stunts like this. It's absurd. I would laugh if it weren't so sad that this person has to suffer because of some fundamentalist, religious dogma.

To me this is state-committed terrorism. I read the headline and a chill went down my back.
This is the Monty Python "Shes a witch, burn her!" scene in real life. I judge a religion based on how they treat non-followers. But damn, if they want people to convert, they are totally doing it wrong.

For the government of Saudi Arabia

Fuck you KSA, Fuck you. I fucking hate your guts. I wish my country would stop being allies and tell you to grow the fuck up and join the civilized world. You claim blasphemy is offensive? well the rest of us find your disgusting behaviour profoundly offensive. Fuck you cunts

Oh and i've drawn a big picture of Mohammed. With a tiny cock.  
I would consider this to be radical islam
The UN is a fucking joke.
Modern day nazis.
Remember this any time anyone ever says "it's just a few/it's a radical outlier of the Islamic/Muslim community". If that's the case, then sure it's just a few but it's the few that matter. It's the few that impact laws and public policy. That's a pretty fucking important few. Oh, and it's not "just a few". It's not all but it's enough that it's a fucking problem.
Its the joke of the century that Saudi Arabia is the head of the human rights council. 
That's just a cover story. It's like when Stalin executed people for "trying to overthrow the state". In reality, it was some dude who complained about his bread rations.
  
He's been sentenced to death because he published a video of the police torturing someone. It's purely political, it has nothing to do with religion. Saudi Arabia just uses religion as a pretext to do what totalitarian states have been doing for centuries. 
Essentially Isis. 
Damned primitive barbarian scumbags.
Sounds like something ISIS would do. 
Religion of Pieces.
Say someone didn't believe in the moon. You'd show the guy the moon and all the evidence of its existence to him, but he just isn't buying it. You'd write him off as a loony right? His refusal to acknowledge the moon's existence would just be baffling. Now, if god is as real as the moon, then why do people have such violent reactions to people who say that he does not exist?
Saudi is just a succesful version of Isis
Without Saudi Arabia's fucked up ideology, neither ISIS or Al Qaeda would exist. 
"moderate muslims "be like
"it has nothing todo with islam"
lmao
this seems a very Deash thing to do.

gonna start calling them saudeash from now on
This makes me soooo angry! How can we call them allies? If the guy was Christian or Jewish we wouldn't accept this barbarism.
90% of Reddit's user-base to be condemned to death for atheism
"Religon of peace"
Islam never change 
This is what 'Moderate Islam' looks like.
And yet they are given millions in aid from the U.S, tell me why is this regime good (Saudi's) and Assad is bad? seam very hypocritical. 
[deleted]
This radical Islam behind the mask of a court system as if to sound just. This is disgusting 
Barbaric loons.
In other news, Saudi Arabia is still a total ass maggot
It makes me feel disgusted to be an American that our politicians including the president isn't speaking out and condoning this barbaric sentence publicly.
This is the difference between the Islam of Saudi Arabia?
We better give them a couple billion dollars of high tech weaponry, though. Just saying.
Then the extremists wonder why all sane people look at Islam's Shariya law and nope right the fuck away from it. Cause all those motherfuckas are crazy!
Don't we have enough petroleum to tell these people to kiss off?  Why do we have to deal with these people?  This is some archaic shit.
Literally ISIS
reminds me of daesh
Why not exile him from the country, what's wrong with these people.
Saudi Arabia has signed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, hasn't it? As a UN member they are bound by it, aren't they? It covers freedom of religious conscience, doesn't it? How can they have a law against religious conversion ("apostasy") or atheism? I know governments are cynical and oil money blah blah blah but why don't more commentators point out how these laws ought to result in their suspension from international bodies?
I have a brilliant idea. Let's bring millions of people like those in Saudi Arabia into Europe and America.  What could possibly go wrong!?
I don't see what the issue is? Saudi Arabia is a close ally with America with a deep history that brings our free nations together.   If anything we should bring that punishment here. I mean it's not like he just raped or killed anyone, he doesn't believe In God... That's pretty much up there with ISIS
Maybe he just didn't want to worship a pedophile.
wooooo when is atheist its news
Literally DAESH.
They sell us oil so it's ok.
Rule #1:  Move to a western country before you convert
 
And people still wonder how ISIS was able to spread so quickly.
Not surprising by a country ruled by basically the same laws that ISIS wants to establish in Iraq and Syria, oh wait what, they're our allies? I've said nothing
If you live in Saudi Arabia and are reading this : Isn't it about time to become a vigilante murderer? 
Coming to Europe in a near future.
If only we'd get rid of ISIS... all other Muslims could finally reveal how much they love individual liberties and freedom of speech.  /s
This is why Islam is the worst religion. You can't leave without fearing for your life.
Death for atheism is a common theme among the religion of Islam.

See this articulate Imam say exactly this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhpRlkrMWy8

Statistical facts of the matter: A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2010 found relatively widespread popular support for the death penalty as a punishment for apostasy in Egypt (84% of respondents in favor of death penalty), Jordan (86% in favor), Indonesia (30%), Pakistan (76%), Nigeria (51%), and relatively minor support in Lebanon (6% in favor) and Turkey (5%)

Please view the infographic linked above.
When Iran's theocratic regime is finally replaced and that country takes back its role as the region's hegemon, we'll be a lot better off. Buy some accounts iran is more atheistic than America, would be nice to have them along with a kurdish state.
For everyone who didn't read the article.  
He was **accused** of atheism. He stated that it was a lie and he was a faithful Muslim.  
&gt; He's not an atheist. He is a Muslim artist and poet ... He's very sensitive, he's very intelligent. He's a very good friend to major artists," said Stephen Stapleton, 
i would have no problem with dropping a few bombs on these fuckers
Our brave president will make some smarmy, uninspired comment and then continue to do business with these murderous thugs that are exactly like ISIS in every meaningful way.  He's a coward and the US is a cowardly nation.
Middle east person sentenced to death for [anything not the approved type of Islam] is becoming a pretty common headline.
That country needs to be turned to glass. 
So, Reddit, what's the other side to this story?
[deleted]
filthy sand monkeys
Sigh! We atheists are really screwed in the Islam majority countries. 
Saudi Arabia = ISIS = Nazis ideology.
Remember folks, that's America's oil buddy right there. 

The one they wouldn't invade despite the majority of the 9/11 hijackers coming from that shithole of a country.
Saudi Arabia are cunts 
Soooo..........

Did you know Scientist have discovered a way to travel BACK IN TIME!

It's true!

They can take you back to the Iron Age!

The instructions are of how are in the Qur'an!
Why cant we wage war against these fuckers?!?!

ohh right... because Obama prefers to kill innocents with his Drones and is allied with this shit country
Why do these keep getting posted. None of this is fucking new. The Middle East Muslims have been stoning, beheading, and shooting anyone who isn't "innocent" which in their terms is anyone who doesn't agree with them. This is not world news. This is the same shit they have been doing for centuries. I'm glad it's getting more attention but I hope you guys realize this is not the first killing like this and it will most certainly not be the last. 
Ah, the definition of a cult.
Should be the other way around and you should be put to death because he published a video of the earth.
Wasn't this posted a week ago?
I'm not surprised, its a shit country.
Stephen Stapleton, founding director of the London-based Edge of Arabia, which promotes Saudi artists went full retard:

"The reality of art is you're going to have cases like this"

The reality of terrorist idiots which are the Saudis is that you're going to have cases like this.

To clarify, they rule by terrorising people into submission by beatings, flogging, and brutal executions.


What can we do go stop this from happening?
We need an operation dinner-out. 
Give them some bombs in exchange for oil and everything will be fine
That's weird the last time I checked it was 2015. 
Those who do not like ketchup, and speak in public against it will receive 1000 lashes.    
pro tip: dont be openly atheist and live in saudi arabia
What great allies.
cunts
dont we have the right to chose our religion ?!?!
I always see  atheists getting sentenced to death. How is the situation about christians  and atheist atheists?
LOL so I cant go to saudi Arabia? Interesting to know that.
The article kind of omits it, but he wasn't sued for being atheist, he was sued for making various public speaches against religion in SA.

I'm not saying that this should lead to a death sentence, you shouldn't even be bothered by such thing, but he was literally giving speeches against Islam in SA.
Religion.
Saudi Arabia is just like ISIS.
House of Saud = House of Satan
"Human Rights"

It must've got lost in translation.

One could even say Saudi Arabia is ISIS.
ISIS is that you hiding as Saudi Arabia? Oh you. ^^^^shit^^^^cunts

fucking monsters dude 
Only after reading the title for the fifth time, did I realise that it wasn't ISIS, but Saudi Arabia. 
Good thing they have nothing to do with human rights for the UN 
Other than smaller numbers probably, how is this any better than the Holocaust, what the fuck is wrong with people.
90% of Reddit's user-base to be condemned to death for atheism
If Isis were selling Oil we would be supporting them right now, flying airstrikes on Assad
Saudi Arabia is a country of terrorists that the US fully supports and I hope they run out of oil very soon. 
ISIS!  do I get gold now too?
I would like to formally piss in the face of Saudi Arabia. 
I can't wait until these Saudi scumbags run out of oil money.
Moment like this you wished batman was real and you can ask him to bring this guy over like he did the asian guy to pay for his crime in the dark knight movie.
There is nothing you can ask from this short minded people blinded by religion. They are living in the european middle ages, beheading people, applying lashes and sorts.... 
Didn't they appoint Saudi Arabia head of the UN Human Rights Council? The hypocrisy is making my head hurt.
They are dumb as fuck! Cut the hand of whoever dare to steel even an apple from a grocery store, kill apostates....

D-U-M-B! We are in 21st century ffs.

Cutting hands was used  in an age where prisons were already filled all the time with criminals... so they can't put in jail someone who is steeling but since he cannot be left unpunished hands were cut.

Killing apostates was never mentionned in the coran (in my knowledge) 
We should cut all ties with that barbarous state. They aren't our friends and when we want to use their airbase we can take it from the bastards.
Why the US is staunch allied with that ses pit I will never know, time to unsuckle from the oil teet. 
If I lived in Saudi Arabia right now I would do anything I can to get the fuck out of there as soon as possible.
What a catch 22 in Islam, Muslims who don't believe in apostasy laws will be tried for apostasy.
Institutionalized terrorism, nothing more. 
So many people I know have lost all respect and faith in Saudi Arabia. Sad times when you can still get sentenced to death for not believing in a God....
Ahh it is no suprise, anyone who convert to athisim get sentenced to death. 
Can't wait for mass adoption of electric cars
let's tweet http://europe.newsweek.com/saudi-arabia-sue-twitter-user-who-called-poets-death-sentence-isis-398415?rm=eu

Well, that seals it. I'm never going to Saudi Arabia. Not that I ever would have anyway lol.
Well that sucks 
Honestly Saudi Arabia is fuckn terrible. 
We all need to admit they where wrong a some point....am i the only one to notice?
Ignorant cavemen. Next up sacrifice a chicken, oh what the Orthodox Jews in NYC already do that. https://www.rt.com/usa/315485-orthodox-jews-slaughter-chicken-kaporos/
Is it still a good idea to bring in refugees that overwhelmingly agree with this policy? 
He's been sentenced to death for back home.
Saudi Arabia is pretty much equivalent to ISIS.  Fuck them.
Isn't it great that they're our staunch allies in the region and we sell them all our latest fighter planes, missiles and other military hardware?  

^not ^really.
why Americans do not protest against the foreign policy with Saudi Arabia.
it must be money and oil 
"sentenced to death for atheism"

What. The. Fuck.
I'm so glad they're our allies, their tolerant practices are nothing like ISIS.  /s 
They openly speak of their stone age, and then have to sell to world militaries to fight ISIS.
Well, if you want to be a Muslim, then this shouldn't be a problem. 
Saudi Arabia will never have scientists that aren't shitty themselves every day for doing something incorrectly.
One thing I find Saudis to be created by Jihad and to use the Quran as the constitution.
What year is it? 
But damn, if they did not get the ideas for their shit?
And these guys are our friends right?
Didn't America used to bomb countries like this, not defend and ally with them? 
Any Saudi's reading the comments please defend these beliefs. If I was not a Muslim living in Saudi Arabia would I be charged the same for atheism or is this only applicable to other Muslims ? And yes it is worse than ISIS because we all agree they are terrorist pieces of shit not a legitimate government. 
Sounds reasonable, lets arm them. 
Saudi ARABIA is very ISIS like.

If it wasn't for their vast wealth, they'd just be a bunch of dessert barbarians. 

And no one cares. Because oil.
Aren't these dudes head of the u.n. committee on human rights now?
because saudi is an American ally, this is 100% acceptable 
May god be with him...
Good to see US allies holding up decent humanitarian standards.
idiots
usa friend saudi isis arabia

edit: /u/rckchlkjhwk posits that this was from earlier on Friday, though I didn't see anything this specific mentioned in articles I read.
I mean what does it take for a country to raise its terror threat to imminent? They have information of a terror attack that could happen or what? 
American here in Brussels. Just flew in tonight. Cab dropped us off near our accommodations and there were police and military with machine guns all along the main drag. Still went out for a walk and dinner without incident. In fact, the city seemed fine/normal. Lots of people out partying/having fun. It was reassuring! Sirens woke us up a hour ago -- 7 or so police cars all in a row, going away in a hurry. Street lights went out a half hour later then came back on a minute later. Staying indoors tomorrow (ugh) and seeing what's what. Happy to update as I see/hear things. 
**12:35**The mayor of Molenbeek Françoise Schepmans (MR) sends troops to the supermarkets in its municipality. According to the French-language public broadcaster RTBF there are soldiers sent to the supermarket Carrefour, Delhaize, Aldi and Lidl in the neighborhood around the Gentsesteenweg.
The mayor of Brussels encourages the managers of stores to close their case. Yvan Mayeur directed his question to the owners of affairs in the Pentagon, on the Elsensesteenweg, the Porte de Namur and Louise district.

**12:18:** in the busiest shopping street in Brussels close to the shops one by one the doors. Reported RTBF. Previously Mediamarkt al continued increasing, but now also the other stores next.

**11:52 HLN reports:**The match Lokeren Anderlecht is still canceled tonight. The Pro League said in a tweet.
Earlier, let Pro League know that all scheduled matches in the sixteenth match day in the top class football just go ahead despite the increased terror threat.
In government circles, people already "not amused" about the refusal to cancel the match day in football.

**11:40 Het Nieuwsblad reports:** Friday investigators have new raids held in Molenbeek. In addition, various weapons were found. It also spoke of explosives and chemical products. According to RTBF was a "key figure" was arrested in the investigation into the attacks in Paris.

**11:25h HLN news reports:** Raising the threat level four in the Brussels Region, according to some French-language news sites to do with a search of Molenbeek, which were last night a large quantity of weapons and explosives were found. The security forces were last night around 23h invaded in a building on the corner of Vierwindenstraat and Isidore Teirlinckstraat. It is not known whether arrests were made.

**10:42 HLN reports:**Prime Minister Michel announced four measures as a result of the increased threat level.

As potential targets cited the premier shopping centers, public transport and major events.

The terrorist threat has decided to:

1. The number of major events to push back.

2. The Brussels metro to stop until Sunday afternoon, there would be a new evaluation come from OCAD, the organ of the terrorist threat.

3. Increasing the capacity of police and soldiers, particularly in Brussels.

4. commissioning of a special number (1771) on the crisis center for those with questions.
[deleted]
It's good that they make these threats very public and broadcast it everywhere. I think if would be terrorists see that people know something is coming they might call off immediate plans, giving security forces more time to find/stop them. 
Wow. They must be fairly certain something big is about to happen.
UPDATE from press conference (i translated all Dutch, and some of the French that I understood.)
threat level 3-&gt;4 in Brussels (we had info about a potential attacks) 3 in the rest of the country  
Potential targets: commercial centres, public traffic, all events with large crowds  
The government will do 4 things:  
--They will limit the number of large events  
--Metro canceled until tomorrow afternoon(midday?), at which it will be reviewed in another meeting  
--Police and Military capacity increased  
--New crisis telephone number for information: 1771  

2nd Belgian victim confirmed (from attacks of yesterday). Four others are safe

Journalist question about Molenbeek: (did you make this decicion because they found chemicals and expolosives in a search?)  
Response: I said that we wouldn't comment about ongoing investigations
At least they have leads, it could be worse, means they have Intel 
The metro in Brussels is shut down on certain lines, most likely through the weekend.  

Best source I could find for the Reuters bit: http://www.trust.org/item/20151121023742-8xnc1
I had a plan to go to Brussels next week. Guess I'll be stuck at home, drinking beer, watching football and learning how to cook lasagna.
Meanwhile the syrian alert level is still cloudy with a chance of russia
Further updates from local news:

- Subway services in the capital have been suspended
- There is an official recommendation to cancel events in the capital region
- There is an official recommendation to cancel all soccer matches in the first and second league nationwide

(http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20151121_01982467)

The suspicion in that paper is that this has to do with Salah Abdeslam behing spotted in Brussels.
One time, at a KU Leuven computer lab, I met a (former) Chechen rebel. He cooked a mean navy macaroni.
My only fear is some shitty chemical/bio weapon being used
Bring Me the Horizon and FIDLAR have shows in Brussels tomorrow night. FIDLAR's a SoCal rock band,much like Eagles of Death Metal. Bring Me the Horizon is a British rock band.

If I had tickets to either of those shows, I would just skip it TBH.
They hate us because of our beers. And our chocolate. And our mussels. And our capacity at not having a government, probably.

http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws/videozone/programmas/journaal/2.41847?video=1.2502099[1]

Basically what has been said is that Charles Michel invoked 4 measurements for Brussels:

- Cancellation of big events
- More army and police
- Close of the metro in the city
- New emergency number with questions or alerts on terrorism or attacks. This is 1771.

What's going on with the world? 

Edit: missing punctuation.
Anyone got a live news feed for this story?

if the threat levels are not raised and something was to happen , the outcry would be huge, but when the threat level is raised people are paniced and get scared. its a no win situation because people need/want to feel reassured about something they know almost nothing about. the realistic outcome is that nothing will happen and threat levels will go back to normal and live continues as if nothing ever happened in a few days time. years of living in London with the threat of IRA attacks has taught me that raising threat levels are more to do with being able to legally deploy troops and police to an area and to implement measures such as transport closures etc, rather than meaning an actual attack will take place. ( i hope ) keep calm, dont panic.


Man I would be scared as hell if I lived there, I don't even go outside when the UV level of alert is high :/
Subways aren't running. Police and military are patrolling the city. Universities have sent emails asking students to remain at home. And my fucking brother isn't answering his phone, as always! Damn! This is scary because, although we really don't know much, we can safely assume that there is a direct threat of attack, given all the measures taken. And the terrorists might put off whatever their plan was, wait for security measures to drop, them strike. They are trying to instill fear and unfortunately, succeeding.
Not gonna let this decide my plan for the weekends. I'll be out in Bruges tonight, drinking with the mates and having some football on TV. 

Fuck ISIS or any terrorist that thinks he'll stop me
feels alot like america post 9/11 with the terror levels...feels very similar
Can someone ELI5 why the threat has been raised to imminent? Like, why do they think they are going to get attacked? 
I'm an American that was just in Brussels for a few days in August as part of my European vacation. 

This. Fucking. Sucks. 

Fuck terrorism. The Belgians were super nice people and I had ~~a fucking blast~~ an amazing time in their country. 

I seriously miss Belgium. I think if it everyday. I wish I was at Rock Classic or Delirium right now. 

EDIT: I wrote this kind of drunk last night before heading to bed.  Basically just wanted to come back and say that really my sentiment in this was that from my experience the Belgians were amazing people and I was empathizing with the current situation in Brussels.  etc. etc.
As a Belgian... : We did ?!
I live near Molenbeek (the part of to wn that they are and have been looking for people related to the Paris attacks). 

Staying inside today, this is some unsettling shit. It's really quite outside. I was going to buy my first suit today, moving that intention to next week I guess. :(

Sexually repressed delusional religious cunts. Tiresome in the extreme.
Belgian here. I've been uncomfortable since the Paris attacks. I went to Antwerp that weekend and saw people huddle together. Suddenly 3 ambulances passed me and drove towards the station. People started walking faster in all directions to get away, the tension was unbearable. There's a lot of underlying fear right now. The fact that we are at level 4 means they must have intel about an upcoming attack. Usually the level would be 3. The consequences of level 4 according to a Belgian newspaper:

* Police and army are prominently present everywhere, especially in Brussels but also across the country.
* The subways are closed in Brussels. Trains are still accessible, but might be cancelled later.
* ~~All soccer matches are cancelled.~~ They will only be cancelling Lokeren-Anderlecht!
* We are being asked to avoid going to the capital and even to stay close to home.
* All big events have been cancelled.
* All political activities have been cancelled.
* All classes at the VUB (University in Brussels) are cancelled.

That's basically what is happening until now. There should be more info throughout the day with extra news coverage.
ELI5?

Edit: I know about all the Paris stuff, but why Belgium specifically as opposed to like Germany or Italy or Luxembourg?

Edit 2: okay that makes more sense, thanks kind redditors!
I wonder what [Jacques Brel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2kkr0e_dTQ) would say about this.
They found chemicals, explosives and weapons in Molenbeek, they shut down the metro stations so i fear they plan an attack in the metro or Brussels central.
Well *something’s* going down. Intel must have found something.
Far out... even Australia's smarttraveller website is putting belgium is the "yellow" zone - high degree of caution.

The terror threat has been imminent for Belgium Jews for a while now.

Fucking christ here we go again. 
The more this type of shit happens the more "you look like a terrorist" 'jokes' again. fucking hell man, so tired of this
Walking around in Brussels today feels like someone has been playing GTA and has reached full stars...
This is the new normal. 
Welp, I was in Brussels all day sightseeing.  Oops!   We did get to see some really cool cathedrals, and the EU Parliment, though!

Nobody seemed to be concerned about anything.  In fact, there were a bunch of students out doing some cool party thing in the city squrare, which looked fun.

There were some military guys about, but that's really it (and there have been Military guys all over western Europe for the past week).
Has there ever been a case when a country suddenly raises its terror alert, and there is then an attack? Most attacks seem to come out of the blue (relatively speaking).  I can't imagine anything going down in Brussels on Saturday because we heard about a terror alert in advance.
Can someone tell me the risk of an attack in Berlin? This is really messed up, I have left the country 3 times so far this year, once to Sharm el Sheik, then Brussels, then I was just outside Paris only two weeks ago. I am due to go to Berlin a week today and I am really freaking out!
Let's hope Brussels sprouts some muscles and goes Van Damme on some terrorist asses before anything bad happens. 
According to Sky news Belgian pm just said the terror alert level is based on 'precise information' that suggests there could be a Paris style attack.

Always fun when you get a mail from your university with safety instructions and a warning for terrorist activities on your campus.

[The first thing I thought of when reading the title](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhS7q3oB35s)
From JOHN CLEESE

The English are feeling the pinch in relation to recent events in Syria and
have therefore raised their security level from "Miffed" to "Peeved."
Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to "Irritated" or even
"A Bit Cross." The English have not been "A Bit Cross" since the blitz in
1940 when tea supplies nearly ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized
from "Tiresome" to "A Bloody Nuisance." The last time the British issued a
"Bloody Nuisance" warning level was in 1588, when threatened by the Spanish
Armada.


The Scots have raised their threat level from "Pissed Off" to "Let's get the
Bastards." They don't have any other levels. This is the reason they have
been used on the front line of the British army for the last 300 years.


The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror
alert level from "Run" to "Hide." The only two higher levels in France are
"Collaborate" and "Surrender." The rise was precipitated by a recent fire
that destroyed France 's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the
country's military capability.


Italy has increased the alert level from "Shout Loudly and Excitedly" to
"Elaborate Military Posturing." Two more levels remain: "Ineffective Combat
Operations" and "Change Sides."


The Germans have increased their alert state from "Disdainful Arrogance"
to "Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs." They also have two higher
levels: "Invade a Neighbour" and "Lose."


Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual; the only threat
they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels ..


The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy.
These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy
can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.


Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from "No worries" to
"She'll be right, Mate." Two more escalation levels remain: "Crikey! I think
we'll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!" and "The barbie is
cancelled." So far no situation has ever warranted use of the last final
escalation level.

And as a final thought - Greece is collapsing, the Iranians are getting
aggressive, and Rome is in disarray. Welcome back to 430 BC.
God I love Belgium, this is so sad. I hope they can shut these bastards down. It's such a cool international vibe. I remember being pleasantly drunk eating awesome cheese and lying in a park on a sunny day. And thats Belgium. No way they should be dealing with this shit. They don't deserve this.


The Belgian army will be patrolling the streets as soon as they start back to work on Monday.
I was there yesterday. Fucking badass cops with FN FALs and MP5s walking around. Shit sucks because terror and stuff but I won't lie, it looks awesome. 

Nearly as awesome as seeing cops with AK-74s in Russia at football games.
Is it bad for me to be worried about my campus. I go to a school that is very diverse and has a lot of muslim students. To be honest, this shit freaks me out. I mean i know they are extremist that muslims don't associate themselves with, and yes there are 1.5 billion muslims. But still....This shit freaks me the fuck out. 
In Brussels, with my whole family visiting from abroad... I guess we'll stay hope for the week end... 
I live in Canada and we had two security guards standing in my store today due to the events in the past couple days. It really is having an effect on people around the world.
I've had a trip planned to go to Brussels and Paris for the past couple months. Just my luck.
I hate when they say "Imminent threat" they called that so many times, and nothing happens. Could they just "say high risk instead?"
They really need to adjust these alert statuses. I've been working security in a shopping centre that's been on severe (one lower than imminent) for the last 12 months 
Prime minister just said they had very precise information about Paris-styled multiple commandos targeting shopping malls, public places, the subway system and big gatherings (think football matches) -  for what it's worth. He (obviously) won't go into further detail at this point.

The Belgium government as a right to be concerned. When France was attacked they weren't really doing anything against ISIS they kinda neutral and they got attacked. I think it is highly probability Belgium will get attacked.

Behold, European Multiculturalism.

Socialists thought that Islam would be compatible with Multiculturalism and Western Society.

Look where we stand today. No flowers, no love songs, no holding hands. 

Just an aggressive ideology that wants to destroy every other culture but its own.

**EDIT:** To you down voters: you guys don't understand sh*t about what's going on here, nothing, nada. Blindly defending an ideology that will not rest until it has destroyed every other culture. That's what you defend when downvoting comments like these. You must feel so proud. I'm a socialist multiculturalist, but here we are divided in 2 different groups: The one that still believes in Islam, and the other that sees Islam as the biggest threat against a multicultural society in the same way the 1940's Nazism was.
But let's half of the world's muslims enter Europe. That makes sense. 
Ah. The benefits of multiculturalism. Lovely
Western liberalism fails in the face of unadulterated Islamic violence, that is young and virile.

Time for Europe to revert to its defiant &amp; assertive character, or it will go extinct!
Let's bring in more refugees guys
&gt;Are we in fucking america or why do we need to hear about level of threat in some capital in the EU every day? I thought we were smarter than this. This is just making people more afraid. People want to live their lives and not read this bullshit every day. If you want to fight your Oil wars, just do it. Nothing we can do anyways. /u/Shifty2o2



You rather the government not warn the public of a potential serious threat? Let them go on about their day and if something happened, oh well, but hey at least  we didn't scare the public by warning them... okay
This is the new normal. 
Probably those straight white male Christian terrorists AGAIN!!!
Enjoy multiculturalism.
Isn't Islam grand? So peaceful.

We don't need to worry. We're in good hands! Our military is the best!

Ah the old region of peace 
Just out of curiosity, can you get on a plane with a bullet proof vest?
I think it's silly what do you do other than live your life normally?
This is pretty unrelated but is it wrong of me to no longer want to go to a concert I was planning on attending next week? I live in the US but all of this stuff has got me so shaken up that I think I'll be irrationally nervous and on edge the whole time. Am I letting the terrorists win? 
The obvious solution to this is to import more Syrians. 
I hope nothing comes of this and this is just that they found out the Paris escapee is in town.  I hope they get him before anything happens.  

I was thinking though and wondering why we don't see terror acts more often.  Is it that they are stopped by our government/military/police?  Or is it lack of willing participants?  Lack of money?  It seems like if you have willing suicide people, it would be fairly easy to sustain terror around the world every month or so. 
[Politico EU](http://www.politico.eu/) finally has a reason for existing.

I'm not sure what it would take for US cities to be on lockdown with military roaming around like this. That would be a bad day for all parties involved. There's nothing good that can come out of that no matter which way you spin it.
I wonder how people will be treated in Belgium if found outside in Brussels on Saturday by Police and Military Services.

I'm flying to Belgium tomorrow, damn. Hope things settle until then.
"BELGIUM!"
 
-Arthur Dent
If these alert states are similar to the old military security alert states we had 20 odd years ago in the UK which were called 'Bikini Alert States' this being the highest level would equate to Bikini Alert Red which was designed for a specific threat to a known target. If these do equate then this highest level is not designed to be sustainable for long periods of time. Ideally limited to 24 hours but certainly no more than 72 hours.
So are they going to deploy Van Damme?
All football games got cancelled 


Most emergency alarms (fire alarms, tsunami sirens, air raid sirens, etc.) are alerts to action. 

Officials always remind people not to panic.  Stay rational and act decisively. 

***"Terror alert level"***

Terrorists prey on fear for a number of obvious and subtle reasons.

Why help them with this type of language?

Ah OK that... 
What's the difference between an "imminent threat" and an imminent threat?
but, today is saturday
I'm supposed to be flying to Brussels in a few hours. This will be interesting.
[deleted]
Is this a surprise? 
Meant to be visiting Brussels in two weeks....
Unfortunately it's only matter of time before these Islamic terrorists perform a Mali/Mumbai/Paris style assault against a hospital here Europe. I'd increase protection of largest and medium sized hospitals across the Europe... asap. 
According to HLN (Belgian newspaper) shops in the Nieuwstraat / Rue Neuve in Brussels are closing right now. [Picture](https://twitter.com/fthevissen/status/668014116305547264/photo/1)
They said it has to do with the fact that they found guns and explosives in a house in molenbeek. The guns and explosives were the same things as in paris
Does anyone else get constantly confused by the reasoning behind these islamist radicals? I think I understand it and then I don't. 

What started it all off? Was it always their religion that believes there will be an apocalypse or was it the western countries taking advantage of their oil supplies that made them hate the west?
Maybe this has something to do with being able to avoid going to the owners of affairs in the Pentagon, on the radio and on tv at frequent intervals.
So we can never rest one day?
Liberal solution: Accept more Muslim immigrants and refugees, close ears and eyes, call everyone who disagrees a racist, while repeating "but not all Muslims".

Guess I won't go Xmas shopping today...
Now we're all America!
It's not going to be easy to see the new Star Wars this year, isn't it?
Man not even waffles are safe now, WTF. 
When I read this I got a fond feeling in my heart of the old color coded threat levels the US had after 9/11 that bush and co. used for political gain over and over... 
I just upgraded the condition of my bowels to imminent threat.
We need the muscles from Brussels JVCD.
Why use the army, when they have JCVD? 
I live in antwerp and I'm not happy to see the army and cops with machine guns in the street and our metro
a number of the paris attackers were from belgium

somethings funny there
The Belgian government failed to see any of the attacks coming even though they were organized from Molenbeek. And all of a sudden my government is capable of spotting these beforehand? Surely this can't be to clear themselves and keep everybody scared.
so what is the exact reason for this ? 
What the hell did belgium even do?
What chemicals did they find? Bleach? Dish soap? Sarin?
I highly doubt (and hope) ISIS will do anything with security as tight as it is. They're a bunch of fucking pussies that can only shoot unarmed people. If they try anything this weekend they're gonna a get seriously fuckin' rekt.
Fuck, Fuck, Fuckity, FUCK! One day that's all I want!
I like how much Europe fought for their freedoms and now they are basically on martial law. All from their fear of looking racist and tackling their bad immigration policies.

The US handles Islamic immigrants well. Somehow there are tons of crazies in Europe.
Europe is faaked big time. These jihadi rats have infested the continent and have abused the civil liberties and now they will strike at will. Ppl will live in constant fear all the time, scared to go out. Good luck wi th  the new wave of refugees coming your way. 
I strongly urge all sides to show restraint.
And yet Europe STILL wants to accept MORE of these fucking people into their countries?


Disgusting. 
I hope aliens come down and destroy us all.
blah blah blah fear mongering crap..

il got outseide and enjoy the empty streets!!
A forgotten fact is that, after 9/11, Belgium created a Threat Level system similar to America's color-coded system. To avoid fear-mongering, Belgium decided to name terror levels after innocuous terms. The most dangerous level is waffle. The term symbolizes two threats, occurring simultaneously, on a common target. 
I'm more mad than scared, missed class because they stopped all metros and tram timetables were being pushed back. AND Uber was banned, how the fuck am I supposed to get to class?

"Belgium raised its terror alert level to the highest level in the capital Brussels on Saturday, warning of an "imminent threat"
It’s a funny (strange not hilarious) old world. One brought to the brink of insanity, by that virtual reality delusion that humanity imagines is reality. All the more peculiar a situation, as a few simple yet unasked test questions would quickly expose that dubious perceptive rendition effect as a fabricated construct being mistaken for the real thing. Take one example in Britain for instance. At what point will it be realized that the risk to life from fundamentalist religious ideology suicide bombers is statistically less, than suicide prompted by fundamentalist political ideology driven benefit withdrawals? In short, the population is being decimated by establishment dogma, at a attrition rate greater than so-called ‘terrorists’ are achieving. 

Accepting muslims equals accepting terror. The more muslims, the more terror.
Is this for the biggest threat to us which is of course global warming? 
OMG, somebody secure the waffles!
God damn I wish these assholes would play their shitty game of martyrdom below the Bible belt. Somewhere where the innocent people around them might actually be able to fight back with equal force. Excuse my brash tone, but I want to skull fuck every last one of those IS cock monkeys. 

Great, this is exactly what ISIS is trying to accomplish. Fuck. I wish I had more to say, but this is exactly what terrorism is trying to accomplish. Terrorize people to not live their lives, because it doesn't coincide with their beliefs. 
if I was in Belgium right now, I would strut around wearing an American flag as a cape and then after about 30 seconds I would get scared and run back to my hotel with pee coming out of my penis and I would have to ball up the American flag and cover up my pee stained jorts on the way to the elevator so I don't ruin my chances with the hot hotel clerk that Im never going to say more than two words for. then when I get back to my room I masturbate and cry myself to sleep. hope I didn't drone on too much here. 

*spelled "two", "to" and I didn't want some grammar Nazi up in my grill
The only way this could possibly help anyone is if they told people what the threat was or how to protect against it.  But instead, the only advice they've given is to submit to government "security checks" and only believe information from the government.

In other words, be afraid of an unknown danger, trust the government implicitly, and don't even attempt to protect yourself because only the government can help you.
Is the world ending?
If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas
From the land of waffles, chocolate, and beer, here, have some fear.
Anyone heard anything from Angela Merkel yet??..Didn't think so...She has gone unnaturally quiet since the Paris massacre..Seems to be gone into hiding since she caused the damage of allowing Europe to be infested by these jihadi types....What an amazing leader Europe has..
I... don't think it's the Belgians who should be worried. 

Honestly I think it's Germany or the Netherlands.

My eyes are on Düsseldorf.
Hey Europe, you've now been introduced to what Americans felt after 9/11, "we don't know where, we don't know when, but something awful is going to happen.".  


I feel like it's all interconnected by the big players at the top of the food chain. Too many coincidences with TPP and safe harbor and these "home grown" terrorists.

/u/fuckswithducks
great, now babies are going to join daesh isis
Let's troll them until they ragequit the jihad.
I feel like this is one of the more effective ways of combating terrorism.  Let the government treat them seriously, and we can make fun of them.
The next step is to find a way to push these images to the top of Google Images, so that when someone searches for isis the duck pictures are the first 50 results.
I read it as rubber dicks. Utterly dissapointed.
They should shop the ISIS dildo flag in also.

http://imgur.com/gallery/HcQXW2o
We should dub every Isis propaganda video with Donal duck voice when jihadists talk.


Some of you have responded negatively to this, but, really, isn't this how you fight an ideology? Make a fucking joke out of it! Turning the zeitgeist against Islamic extremism is how you keep them from recruiting people. 
Would you rather fight 100 duck sized isises or 1 Isis sized duck?
I've said it elsewhere and I'll say it again. We need to use cyberbullying to its fullest extent against Daesh who use social media.

**Someone needs to capitalize on their social media presence.**

* Find stockpiles of photos of very social media active members of ISIS and use them to create gay dating site profiles, listing Jihad, obscure tentacle hentai, and drinking alcohol as their primary interests. This will discredit them should anyone google their name.

Don't stop there. Denigrate them to the absolute fullest. Start tweeting as them with screenshots of the following:

* Professional-grade photoshop work to make them look like neckbeards (since most have the full beards already).

* Shop fedoras onto their heads.

* Shop logos onto their shirts and decals on their guns of brands that are heavily associated with neckbeards. (Doritos, Mountain Dew, My Little Pony, and anime. Lots and lots of anime. Especially SAO.)

* Shop photos of them with dakimakuras (fuckable body pillows with anime girls on them), laying in bed, taking a selfie, captioned "just hanging out with my virgin waifu."

These monsters, in their pride to show the world how fucking "badass" they are, are basically manufacturing a veritable **gold mine** of exploitable social content. We need to start using it.
/u/fuckswithducks appointed as Allied Supreme Commander in fight against ISIS. 
This should be actual policy for all western media. Any photos received of ISIL members are shopped to show a duck before being published. 

It serves two purposes:
1. Removing any celebrity from the terrorist pictured 
2. Within a couple of months practically all Internet searches for images of ISIL will be nothing but ducks. Anyone looking for a file photo or a picture to hotlink will see nothing but ducks.
This is fantastic. Also definitely one of the best ways to respond. ISIS wants to terrify people and turn us all against each other, but really what we should be doing is all working together to photoshop rubber ducks on their heads. A++ work.

The internet isn't fighting terror with humor. The internet is making itself feel good about doing nothing yet again.

"Haha we made this ISIS picture into something funny with ducks!" 

Meanwhile, ISIS executes another round of prisoners for being gay, or christian, or the wrong type of muslim, whilst giving no fucks about some silly picture on the internet. 

No lives are being saved, no territory regained, no victory being won. Its a pointless gesture, and should be regarded as little more than something vaguely amusing.

We need to drop this stupid concept of "you can't kill an idea with bullets or bombs". Because while technically true, we can kill everyone who believes in that idea. Bullets and bombs are still 100% effective on those guys. And when you strike with enough force, and enough fury, people will look at that idea and go "Do I really want to die quick, fast, and in a hurry? No, no I don't."
Duckheads. All of them.
"I'm fighting terror. huehueheuuehue" come on.
Mocked with what now?
Not humor, but humiliation.  I'm still down with that of course.  
Since ISIS doesn't really represent Islam, shouldn't they be given pig's heads?
This seems like propaganda.  Yellow rubber ducks are something a CIA disinformation officer would come up with.  Use that sloth with sunglasses next time.
Rubber ducky rapids, bro.
I have a feeling this will only incite and invite violence, much like Charlie Hebdo.

However, ISIS doesn't really need motivation since they're already motivated.

Why don't they just photoshop them into gay porn. Like getting fucked in the ass by the gayest dudes ever. I always thought they should do this with school shooters as well, like make it a trend. Shooters want to be famous for getting on the news, but if everybody starts photoshopping them into gay porn after they do something horrible, maybe part of the incentive to be famous will be gone

Are these images on ISIS boards and sites that they've hacked, or is this just a few people posting these on their own Twitter?

Investigate the Saudi influence that was behind importing Wahabist preachers and the Saudi Money that paid for the mosques and so influenced traditional Islamic toleration to become like Saudi's ideological extremism. A thirty year process that is now bearing its terrible harvest in the West but has already had devastating effects from Sudans civil war in the 80's to the situation right now in Yemen.
Great move. I as a Canadian Muslim can say that there are some really bigoted mosques around here and they need to be taken care of. 

A friend of mine explained to me that the imam of the mosque he went to banned the wearing of poppies on remembrance day because Canadian soldiers spilled the blood of their Muslim brothers or some bullshit like that. 

Not all mosques are the same though, the one I go to for example gives out poppies and helps the Royal Canadian legion with donations themselves, so there are always two sides of the coin on this. 

Tldr; great move to tackle some shitty mosques spewing nothing but irrationality. 

Edit: Appreciate the kind words everybody. I felt like I haven't had some nice and sophisticated conversations on reddit in a while :) 
25 years too late.
I'll just put a bit of context here if anyone wants to bother.

The french government and religion have had a complicated story during the 19th century, which resulted in 1905 in the complete separation of church and state. Not a single cent of taxpayer money goes to any religious organization, and churches can preach whatever they want, provided they respect the law. It is kind of a given that established religions respect the laws, so there isn't much surveillance done in that regard. There is however a very strict surveillance of cults (by an organism called miviludes) to make sure they aren't putting anyone in danger or doing anything illegal.

Our laws concerning free speech are a bit different than in the US. To copy wikipedia : France prohibits by its penal code and by its press laws public and private communication which is defamatory or insulting, or which incites discrimination, hatred, or violence against a person or a group of persons on account of place of origin, ethnicity or lack thereof, nationality, race, specific religion, sex, sexual orientation, or handicap. The law prohibits declarations that justify or deny crimes against humanity, for example, the Holocaust.



Wether you find those laws justified or not is another debate (though I personally think freedom is not as easily quantifiable as american media make it look like and sometimes less is more). The point is to not give islam the free pass it had, because clearly there are problematic cases. This is not a restriction of anyones liberty, this is not a modification of the laws, and there is no slippery slope. This is just us doing a better job at making people follow the law.
Did America do anything similar to this after 9/11?
In Europe, this has been considered racist and Islamophobic. When this happens in Muslim countries as it has, it's, you know...just let them do what they gotta do. And so on. 
Other european countries should follow suit. Time to eject the enemy within once and for all. 
If you are peaceful then celebrate your religion in our modern secular societies, we encourage it but if you preach hate and violence in the name of your religion then its time to GTFO.
"Don't be so tolerant that you tolerate intolerance." - Bill Maher
There are a lot of people in this thread calling for surveillance and the rights of innocent people to be taken away.

That's pretty frightening considering here in the west we are fighting to keep all of our rights.

If they did monitor every mosques with cameras and a mic, what's to stop them from doing that to every other person.
Run a Komatsu D575A through the front door while they are kneeling in hatred.
Why not shut down any house of worship where hate is preached?
Like so many other people, you have to wonder why it's taken us this long to shut down centres that are actively preaching hate against their host countries - Why does it have to take a 120 deaths to realise pragmatism is just that, and not racism?
This is a frightening prospect quite frankly. When this becomes status quo who will decide what is hate? 
Good it has to be done. I am all for free speech, but you cannot have groups freely planning and supporting distruction of your own populace. 

What if a group was openly planning to make and build and detonate a nuke, would they be ignored? No they wouldn't. 

Wake up people, not everyone is the same. Democracy and freedom work in societies where people are willing to work and live together. It won't work in the long run when you have groups openly hating and hoping to destroy another group's way of life. 

Basically, the long term plan of these radicals is to use your freedoms against you. They can preach hate, milk off the ridculous welfare system in the West and out breed you 5 to 1. 

Obviously the vast majority are not radicals now, but who knows with future generations that may find openly preached radicalism attractive when they cannot find a job in economic downturns?


Holy shit an actual effective measure. I'm shocked. 
Refreshing to see some common sense action.
25 years too late.
Maybe the west can stop being paly with Saudi Arabia, which btw is the major source of salafi/wahabbi teachings? Remember most muslim countries are poor or developing widescale poverty. Saudi money builds mosques, promotes a narrow and bigoted form of religion. Plus oligarchs from Saudi, Qatar etc have been sources of funds for many radical groups. Heck, 9/11 was funded, planned and carried by Saudis. 
As well intentioned as you may be, what do you think these people are going to do after their mosque has been banned and their imam jailed? If anything helps ISIS more, it's making young men feel that western society hates them and has no place for them. There's got to be a more strategic way to go about this...
What next are you going to send spies every time a preacher open his mouth? This is what the Chinese do in Xinjiang, and it didn't stop attacks. It does make the majority of French people feel good. 

I lived in Indonesia during the Suharto era, where the government did exactly this.  They sent army intelligence to mosques to monitor sermons, if preachers said things they didn't like, they would take them away for "interrogation" ie torture. What end up happening, Suharto drove many of the extremist to Malaysia and the Philippines.

At the end of the day to deal with Islam, France will have to setup a bureaucracy to manage it. Albania has a Committee on Cults, which manages religious affairs. You have to start collecting data, publishing it.  France can't stick its head in the sand and continue with the stupid policy of "We are all French, there is no discrimination in France"



  
Hell, it's about time!
No bashing intended, just an observation that applies to all of us in the West... Common sense immigration standards and expectations of immigrants within our societies would have reduced these issues in the first place. Enough with childish optimism and ultra liberal utopian policies. It's not all or nothing and it never was. As usual the patients run the asylum. It's well past time for reasonable, centrist views to hold sway across the West, before our children's futures are sold in the name of a one sided fantasy. 
This is a great move. To be honest, I feel European nations can sometimes be too careful about their "politically correct" image. Fuck it. If these mosques are spewing hate, they need to be dissolved, and not just in France.

Islamophobia and discrimination will be taunted, of course, but if it helps detecting possible terrorists, then to hell with all these taunts. 
About fucking time
When a religion promotes acts of public prohibition and violence which are in their nature unjustifiably evil and against every sensibility of civilized man. It can no longer be afforded the protections granted to private freedom of conscience. It has declared itself a public actor subject to public debate and censure. It must be excised like racism, sexism, cronyism, and any other form of corruption.

We would not tolerate the KKK or Nazism disguised as religion, yet Islam which is antithetical to western thought is tolerated because it is a "religion". Of course it is truly a political philosophy masquerading as a religion and should not be given freedom of speech or protection from public censure and ridicule. Islam should be relegated to the waste bin of public thought. Scientology is a more respectable belief system than that of the muhamadan.

Religion is by common decency excluded from public ridicule until it becomes apparent that no thinking person of conscience could remain affiliated with the group. Islam has declared itself a public actor and public enemy so antithetical to western ideals that it should not be protected by the politeness of western thought.
This should have been done long ago, but thanks I guess.
Systematic war is the only solution, dismantle the cells one by one.
Reminds me of that Simpsons episode where a meteorite is about to hit Springfield and when it burns up in the atmosphere, the townspeople decide to burn down the observatory so it never happens again.

Good, if you want hate religion move back to the ME and learn it there, otherwise adapt to your peace loving French community.
Yea, about time. This should have been started all over the world after 9/11. They wont do it until the public has been terrorized and murdered. 
About time. Whether they are Saudi-, Iranian- or ISIS affiliated mosques, we shouldn't let our countries be colonised by hostile and extremist religion.

I don't see survailence as a solution though. Just set up an official bureau to set up investigations of mosques that get reported with substantial claims or have been found to have shady financial backing.
As a Muslim, good. Mosques and Madrasas that incite violence have no place in Islam and should be closed.
It's about time.
Nothing new here, we were already throwing out radical Imams from France in the past few months.
How about they also start getting profiles on the people going to these mosques where hate is preached? Stop with trying to be so goddamn PC
Allot of "other/ all religions" in the comments. Lets not pretend as though this is a problem with other religions. This sort of widespread international terrorism is specific to Islam and that is what is being addressed. Unfortunately we can't extend the same freedoms to all members of a community, especially to those that conspire to destroy that community.
Just do it. A religion is not an excuse for the crime. And the hate preaching is a crime(at least in Germany) 
This should be done everywhere. Here in US my Muslim neighbor says he doesn't go to mosque anymore because they incite violence.

Shut down any mosque, church, temple, shrine or any religious institute that incites violence!
About time.
They need to deport the fire brand clerics and Imams as well. Send them to Syria to die as martyrs. 
Cool. I don't get why they didn't do this sooner. Anyone inciting hate should be jailed
It took blood on politicians' hands before they did anything to protect the population.  Remember what "non-judgement" did for you in Paris.  You too have blood on your hands if you shouted down those concerned about extremism as xenophobes.  
Not to be a downer but won't that just drive them underground?
129 innocent people have to die before our societies come to such verdicts. 
As a Muslim, if they have concrete proof that the mosque is preaching hate speech, then they deserve to be shut down. I just want to know that measures will be put in place so that xenophobes can't take advantage of the law. 
Good to see France doing what needs to be done, even if the radical left will scream "racist" until their throats bleed.
Good. Why would you provide someone who is literally brewing ISIS recruits in your own country with benefits? Get rid of that shit stat.
Woah, woah, woah... so, basically, you know you have them in your country and you just let them off the hook even if they may harbor some lunatics who are "ready to sacrifice themselves for Alah"? Dafuq?
This is what always happens. As soon as something scary happens free speech and personal freedom in general ends up taking a hit. 
Because nothing will heal a national tragedy like a good old fashioned witch hunt.

More power to you if you _actually_ find any that match that description, but I'm willing to bet the criteria of mosques is the more important one and that just makes me sad. Hope I'm wrong.
Well, the Muslims can't say we didn't give them a chance. They were allowed into France with relatively little oversight. That is no longer the case. Radicalism will no longer be allowed to fester in those mosques where it is preached. 

My message to the Muslims that aren't radical and love their lives in France and the west: y'all are awesome. You have remained peaceful even amongst fighting around you. You may have even had family members fall victim to either side. Yet you remain peaceful. Thank you. But it's not enough. You have to expose the radicals and silence the imams that spread this filth. You have to work together with the rest of the world to extinguish the hatred that is radical fundamentalism, whether Muslim, Jewish, Christian or pastafarian. Most of us sane westerners still know you exist and thrive in the west. But even us more accepting people are losing patience. More people are chomping at the bit every single day, ready to start a war in the area that will end poorly for both sides. 

I fear is it too late though. I just hope we, as westerners, don't create more hatred for ourselves than we can extinguish. Idk what the right answer is, but I know that we can't keep occupying countries and setting up governments that will inevitably fall. 
Start at the roots. The Saudis and some of the Gulf states spend billions sending people to Muslim communities around the world to spread their hate-filled medieval version of Islam. This poisonous seed has now taken root in many Muslim communities and is bearing fruit. Do you think it was a coincidence that 16 of the 19 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, as were the financial backers?
I am reminded of [this scene from Taken](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH0g1l0IaQ4).
This is a hard thing to debate.

On the one hand, when you hurt freedom of speech, when you attempt to limit the spread of ideas, it's like opening Pandora's box. You'll start limiting speech on everything you don't like.

On the other hand, extremism and terrorism *come from*, or maybe *are* ideas.

I guess it's just a matter of how closely this is regulated and controlled. Hope nobody goes overboard.
A good first step toward eradicate every last shred of the filth infesting Europe.
Why wasn't this done after that attacks on London, Madrid, Toulouse, Copenhagen, Brussels, Paris, Vincennes, and so many others I can't count? 
They have been closing mosques like that in Egypt for 5 years now, and it is not working very well. The problem is much larger than that.
The Friday noon jumma namaz and then speech after that is done of the most bigoted, blatant hate mongering in many mosques especially in non-myslim countries.
I really hate that we all seem to be for the banning of their idiotic speech simply because its idiotic. Let crimes be crimes and speech speech. Unless they are planning attacks let them be.
It sounds good In theory, but what about religious freedom, and what about the fact that they will just move underground to people's basements. 
One week ago, this quote would have been deemed racist. It's interesting how fast things change. 
why the hell did you waited so long for this common sense of a step? Somebody should be made accountable for this laziness/political correctedness....
While I'm technically opposed to this, I do hope that it will have some positive ramifications.
Read that as 'demolition' for a second and was like 'yeah, that's ok too.'
UK/England next, hopefully.  London seems to be the home of a number of such mosques - or rather, hate-spewing Imams. It's not the mosque that's the problem!
And this wasn't done before Friday because....?
This would never happen in England, we prefer to tip-toe around things for fear of offending someone or being called racist
Israel ought to take a page from the French playbook and finally shut down the Al Aqsa mosque.
You can't shine shit, but you certainly can make it smell better.
Facial profiling... those people look like dumbasses.
Cause that's not what the terrorists want or anything.  Marginalization of people sympathetic to their teachings.  Oh no.  How will their vitriolic hate survive if they're not allowed to preach it in the open in public.
This seems like a slippery slope to intruding on people's freedom of speech. What is hateful speech? Do we then tear down churches speaking against homosexuals? Or those speaking against Muslims? Don't get me wrong I'm all for preventing religious violence, but tearing down mosques seems like a bit of a stretch. Moves like this will just cause more hate in the long run. 
I think we (the U.S. and its mighty forces) should re-invade the desert.  No, I don't think we should attack a city and hold its people under extra-national law.  I think we should build an outpost in an otherwise uninhabited space near these conflict zones.  It can still be treated like a military base, but it needs to dispense four things (food, water, medical aid, and information) and also be able to protect itself.  As long as we can gain the trust of people in the area, we can usher in peace one person at a time.

The government can bill it to taxpayers as Mars colonization research or something.
So PC is finally dying.  Good.
As ever, imagine a search-and-replace of "mosques" with "churches" and ask yourself if you'd flip out. Should any government have this power in that case? If all you've got is "but Islam is different!," yeah, that's why you keep hearing people call you a bigot.
How's about that whole Free Speech and Charlie Hebdo stuff. I suppose they've forgotten about it too. So many other FB Ciara to update your profile pic for... Tough to keep up. 
There shouldn't even be Mosques in european countries.
So, they're gonna block Twitter? 

I wonder what PC principle has to say about this?
hopefully they start doing this in the UK too, too many imams spreading disapproval of the western lifestyle, this country gave them everything and there's no praise. Pathetic. It's partially why I became atheist.
lol, I love watching the leftwingers on reddit continue to embarrass themselves on this issue.

When it's white people then totally, gotta shut that hate speech down ridiculing "muh freeze peach!" Non-white people and you dipshits trip all over yourselves crying "b-but free speech is an essential corner stone of western civilization!"

It really is amazing the double standard and hypocrisy when it comes to who the left feels deserves free speech.

I personally think these people should be allowed to continue on their way, even though Islam is toxic garbage through and through, hate speech should still be free speech. Unfortunately, that's not something the left seems to want to extend to those they deem outside the privileged progressive stack.
It begins. For every terrorist there's a mosque and a group of friends and associates, and family, who did not tell authorities, and who support terrorist actions.

France should never have let them in. 10% are Muslim. When it's 51% they can vote for Sharia law and mandatory covering of women and beheading gays.

Islam is incompatible with a free, secular society that values freedom and liberty.
This will in no way have unforeseen negative consequences.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVh8vJwUq-U In this video an imam is teaching kids that if they listen to or play any kind of music god will turn them into monkeys and pigs. This is happening in France.
Le Pen would have done this years ago.
Let's face it, Muslims are the largest threat to a progressive and intellectual society.
[deleted]
Finally!
As a religious man, I gotta love the French not tolerating religious bigots.
This is a step in the right direction. This could not come any sooner. I'm sure it will be attacked by liberals though. 
After ISIS gunned down 30 Brits on a beach in Tunisia, the government there decided to close down 70 radical mosques. Why does it take dead civilians for the West to realize there is a war going on? How many more innocents need to die? Ground troops are the only solution against ISIS.
Strap in boys, this is just one of many decisions fueled by fear. I expect to see many more in the next few weeks.
This is no longer a matter of nationalism or religion, civilization is aligning itself against terrorism. If groups like ISIS keep pushing there terrorist agenda and killing innocent’s things will go very badly for them. Imagine a world where the UN Security Council worked in concert with the backing of the EU to end terrorizing. I think that day is coming and the religious extremists and mad bombers are going to have nowhere to run to and nowhere to hide.
I wish they would do that to these radical Christian churches in America
Good. Then they should do a clean sweep of areas/people sympathetic to this ~~criminal cause~~ enemy combatants and go house to house to look for more weapons/accomplices. 
Well they already throw you in jail for denying the holocaust so might as well.
Looks like a lot of mosques will be closed
Fuck.  Yes.

The French policy of deislamification has begun.  The rest of the West needs to follow suit.
Don't for a second imagine anything that feels good at this point is actually a good solution to this problem. All this stuff about cracking down on Islam is exactly what they want; it's literally been in material released by Islamic Extremist organisations. Winning this is about not reacting by doing what feels good.
Sooooo....no more mosques? I mean it sounds nice, but I don't believe it will ever happen.
will the dissolution be with a strong acid or a base?
No do not dismantle them yet.  Infiltrate them,  get to know the radicals who are recruiting. 

for if you just dismantle the mosques the recruiters will just go underground. 
France has a long and difficult history with religion. I'm not sure that this move will necessarily have the intended consequences.
close them all &amp; ship all the muslims to syria.
The issue is that Islam needs a reformation like Christianity underwent.
I wish every country did this and not just targeting mosques but also churches and temples where hate and intolerance is preached.
Good
So all mosques.
Evidently none of reddit actually believes in free speech 
That means every fucking mosque right
Good. Learn something other than an archaic piece of moral teaching literature. Like, Science.
They should dissolve all the mosques, all the churches, all the temples and begin trials for all of those that propagate these lies created by man and used to justify the killing of other men.
All religion is evil
The same guy who said that last year.
"It's not a crime to preach the Jihad"
https://infocomnet.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/b2jt7tncqaaed9v.jpg
Deport those who attend. 
Hello big brother
Ummm, free speech is kind of a big deal
It is about time. Commonsense approach is needed.
What do they mean by "hate?" If they are encouraging violence then that is legitimate reason to shut them down.  If by "hate" they mean just "hate," then we need to stop claiming that freedom of speech is a western value.
[deleted]
Good this is going to help we its going to be easier too detect possible terorrists..
Why are they speaking English the language of the infidels?
I can't see having the effect you want it to have...  But security theatre is better than no theatre for the public...
Hmmmm.... so pretty much all the mosques right?
Why Mosques, specifically?

I understand the motive here, but it really just seems like adding fuel to the fire. I don't know how to deal with radicalism myself, but won't suppression of it just lead to more of it? 
And then they'll start dissolving mosques where people criticize the government's actions. And then they'll just start dissolving mosques.

its gonna be abused to death to scilience descent, i guarantee it. 
Finally!!
Can we get a definition for "hate speech"?
Did America do anything similar to this after 9/11?
ding ding ding... that is the correct answer.
Less talking more action. It seems that everytime a terrorist attack happens, there is talk of deradicalisation, but no noticable action is ever taken. 
I doubt you have the balls to do so.
Terrorists win again. GJ France
The only issue with a policy like this is, where do you draw the line? Obviously the full on hate preaching should be shut down, but there are definitely grey areas too. Just hope France doesn't go overboard with this.
They should get rid of the people preaching the hate, not the mosques. 
So all of them?
You want to stop funding terrorism?  It's pretty simple, don't buy gas or petroleum products.  When the time comes where these people don't have any money to eat let alone fund their attacks, they will see their state sponsored religious leaders for what they really are.  
Arresting advocates of violence is a needed step. But then France had better prepare for a shitload of car torchings by these Mosque's congregates.
FINALLY!
Interesting, if this were any other group spreading hate, the comments here might be full of sarcastic references to "hug boxes" and "safe spaces." 
Does France have the stomach to make sacrifices to fight ISIS? 
Can't they just remove the preachers? Why the whole mosque too?
So now let's ban all the other hateful places of worship in France. Muslims isn't the only religion that has a few hate preaching places of worship. 
I think this is a good move, although I hope that it isn't used as an excuse to unfairly persecute mosques that aren't spreading hate speech.
"The dissolution of mosques, where hate is preached" or "The dissolution of mosques where hate is preached"? 

That's a pretty important comma. 
Well, here comes the shit storm
Don't forget the private muslim schools teaching kids to do anything but conform 
I wish we would throttle extremism here in the US as well.  It's counter-productive.

What about churches or temples were hate is preached?
OMG... would love if they did that to xtian churches in US (dissolution where hate is preached)!
And all over ISIS land, there was much rejoicing, for their latest terror strike had succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. The "gray zone" of people who accept Muslims but aren't Muslims themselves was going away, and soon there would be only two parties left - the radical right wing lunatics in the west and the radical Caliphates in the Middle East, and forever shall the two be at war, thus destroying our world slowly but surely for completely irrational bullshit reasons.

Terrorists want terror. They *want* France to clamp down on peaceful Muslims to make them stop be peaceful. That's the whole idea of terrorism - to radicalize *both sides*. Why would France give the terrorists what they want? And I speak both of the ISIS terrorists and the local terrorist wannabes like Le Pen.
Islam should be treated like Nazi
Imagine if Clockmed "Texas clock kid" put a bunch of his clocks around Paris tomorrow

Guaranteed mass panic
How about this...  If they want to come into Western countries, they leave their religion where they came from.

What good does it do anyway?
As an American Redditor I know that Europe doesn't have free speech (or at least free speech in the American Sense) is it safe to assume they have the same or similar attitude to free religion?
Can we start dissolving the Christian churches where hatred is preached? If not, then I don't think the mosques can be touched, either.
Can't say I agree with this idea. You get the immediate issue of having to decide where the line is; what qualifies as "hate?" Do you shut down other religious institutions that meet the same criteria?

"What do you say to a government that goes out of its way to protect those who seek to destroy it?" "God bless America."
I don't know how I feel about this. There are a couple potential problems with this in my opinion. 

1. You are now justifying their claims of a "Holy War" by closing down their mosques.

2. You now give them a point of recruitment since they could point to it as "An attack against the Islam faith"

3. And more importantly in my opinion, you risk the spread of hate against all Muslims and risk it getting out of control with mosques that are chill getting closed too. 

France, be careful with this
Lets hope this doesn't turn into a hate parade against all muslims. People need to remember this is how one of the reasons ww2 was started, due to hate of a certain religion. - Am I annoyed some muslims did this, yes. Do I think this will be abused, probably.
You probably should have done that a lot earlier but live and learn right? Stupid multiculturalism. 
But they still aren't deporting? The problems will persist then. 

It's not even a good start. Closing down the mosques will just prove their point that the West is oppressing them. So there will be more anger.

The only solution is to be rid of Muslims.
Way to not handle this like a bunch of pussies! Way to go.
Dissolve all meeting places of hate.
Just define Wahhabisum as what it is, hate speech and ban it.
This is not a new measure. ( I haven't read the article but the title make it sound like it is)
You're free to preach your religion but  if you incitate violence or racism that is considered as a crime.
Oh boy... this could go very well, or very very wrong.
Good, put those weird anti hate-speech laws to use.
Do the same thing with all the other religions and the world will be a much better place.
But what does that mean? What is their definition of hate speech? I mean, sure, if someone is advocating killing the innocent then take that preacher and jail him, but where would the people in that community pray? Most mosques are places of worship where people chip in some money to keep the place running. They're not churches with organized propaganda. They're more like community centers with prayer halls.
Curious to see how this will turn out, and surprised this is what it took to finally intervene. Any religious institution which preaches the destruction of others should not be tolerated.
Genius. Close the mosques and force them underground, where they will be even harder to keep tabs on. They will simply find another way to congregate and spread their awful ideology. Better off just deporting them. 


Good move by France, praiseworthy! And yet if UK or India, even thought about this they'd be criticized by the world. 

Specially India which has faced terrorism for decades, a slight move by these countries the world media will be all over how intolerant they are.
Down with faith schools.
"This is just the beginning... The response of the Republic will be         total... The terrorists will never destroy the Republic, because it is the Republic that will destroy them. " - I swear you could put this line straight into a movie 
This makes sense, since every time there's an attack similar to this one in France, they always say that the suspect was already known by the police as being part of radical Islamic groups.


I understand there's been bombs strapped to terrorist's chests, but my heart stopped for a second at "rocket launcher"
In city of millions, going through 150 houses and finding a rocket launcher is either extremely effective profiling or super fucking scary, either way they're doing it right. 
Civil liberties! Police state! Police brutality! A rocket launcher! oh ok 
Well if a rocket launcher has been found then I'd say it's working
"This is just the beginning... The response of the Republic will be total... The terrorists will never destroy the Republic, because it is the Republic that will destroy them. "

Sounds like a quote from a star wars movie.. 
This is huge, and great news - it is time to dismantle the terrorist cells present on our territory. Also the intel gathered will be worth gold.

Honestly, I think this is a biggest blow to Daesh's influence than airstrikes. Go France.
The question is, will they be able to relinquish that power after the threat has passed?  
We've seen this story before.
Ok, I know gun control clearly doesn't stop these guys from getting them

But how da fuk did they get a rocket launcher? 
Reddit hates invasion of privacy, warrant-less searches and big brother... until it actually matters and it isn't just empty platitudes. Then fuck your civil rights we will sacrifice all the liberty for the feeling of security.
At first I read this as "over 150 searched, executed,...."
Having random stop-and-identify checkpoints for a while might not be a bad way to address the migrant issues and ensure that everyone is registered.
My parents live in Strasbourg and my sister in Lyon. I don't know if I should be glad they found these things and arrested these people or be scared because they found those things and the fact that these people were there in the first place.
I asked my mom to come see me during Christmas so she would be away, her answer: "Hell no". Mom doesn't like bullies.
Damn a rocket launcher they must be pretty far through the game I bet on Friday they were just finding klobbs and shit
Actually, that's the _right_ way of doing this. Have a very rare and exceptional state of emergency. Do whatever you have to do and solve the problem. End the emergency state. 

Are there a few cops/prosecutors who decided to knock on the wrong door to maybe solve another case? Quite likely, but it's going to be _much_ more limited in scope. Not to mention it could backfire in pretty ugly ways if their colleagues find them squandering limited time.


Though I am no fan of things like the "Patriot Act" I am also not under any illusions that the government doesn't SOMETIMES need to use the military as it was intended. It should never be permanent or even a long time. But sometimes, things need to get done and the military and government need to do their job. The problem lies when they change entire laws and take away freedom because of "terrorism and national security."
It's like some people forgot what martial law is all about.
150 searches executed "hmm ok"

Multiple arrests *nods head* "yep, yep, ok"

Rocket Launcher discovered "holy crap"
I don't get why hasn't this been a common thing for over a decade now... If someone expresses support for radical jihadism - search him and keep an eye on him, instead of spying on your entire population.
Rocket launcher - jeesus
Must have been a legally-obtained rocket launcher from Walmart though. Let's be honest.
They will realise they can only push westerners so far until we hit back and when we hit back we don't fuck around.
All european countries should take the same action as france and seek anyone sympathetic to the Jihadists and bring full force upon them. The west has had enough.

ISIS will be decimated within a year.
Bring back the guillotine for those ISIS motherfuckers

OFF WITH THEIR HEADS 
I don't want to fear monger but if this many people are on house arrest and weapons such as a rocket launcher are recovered from some of them.... then we (Europe) definitely have a bigger problem on our hands than most believe.

One of the attackers in Paris was french born and well known to authorities, "he disappeared for six months" his brother said and then he goes and does this. How many of these country born brainwashed radicals are already here, waiting for the order?

Be safe people, remember, in a stampede of people stand still and slowly make your way to stand behind a lamp post/car or beside a wall so you don't trip and get trampled.

In event of emergency, use texting only to lower network traffic and not cause network outages.

Please tell others these things, even if you sound crazy. The people who were attacked in a place like Paris literally had an almost impossibly low chance of being attacked there yet they were... and we should not stay in fear but be weary of more attacks and to not panic.
&gt;Among the items recovered in raids in the Rhone region were **police armbands, police clothing** and several weapons.

Oh, good. Terrorists dressed up as police. Even better.
Every fucking major western city should be doing this, especially now after what happened in Paris.
Good news. Damn i usually dislike arbitrary arrests but it's time to dismantle the entire network and separate wheat from chaff.
Started reading this title thinking it'd be a post about the police abusing their authority, ended it thinking to myself, "Holy shit, a fucking rocket launcher? Carry on coppers, you get dem terrorists."
I'll believe it when I see some deportations happening.
Something I found strange reading a lot of media the last couple of days: A lot of newspapers talked about how the focus of the airstrikes up to now was in targetting french citizens fighting as part of Daesh in Syria. The same articles also refer to how hard it was to keep track of these same fighters once they came back to France. 

How is it that when these assholes are in Syria, its ok to send Hellfire missiles at them while they're driving around, but when they come home, they can't even be arrested? Why don't they just make it illegal to join Daesh, and then lock the fuckers up when they come home? 
But but but police state and George orwell! 


Just kidding! Hell yeah france, get em'
Muslims definitely aren't making the best case for themselves these days.

I hope they give those powers back when they are done.
Yaaaay Muslim culture is so great
Feels like the Deus Ex timeline might actually happen more and more
Excellent. Round up all these psychotic fucks.
I... where do you just get a rocket launcher in France? 
Time to hit up Belgium. 
i am guessing the rocket launcher was on of these a rpg 7  http://www.armyrecognition.com/images/stories/east_europe/russia/weapons/rpg-7/RPG-7_anti-tank_rocket_grenade_launcher_Russia_Russian_army_defence_Industry_line_drawing_blueprint_001.jpg
In 3 days they've uncovered more than the NSA.
Fucking good.
so by this time government was just scratching balls. They were supposed to act way earlier. What is the point of declaring war and doing all drama now. This steps were expected right from beginning.
Why couldn't they convince a judge if those people are so dangerous?
Marine is having consecutive multiple orgasms. Over 150. 
people dont like the patriot act giving new powers but are okay with this, you know why? cause they are actually doing shit instead of spying on what type of porn i jack off to. 
Slippery slope
Actually, that's the _right_ way of doing this. Have a very rare and exceptional state of emergency. Do whatever you have to do and solve the problem. End the emergency state. 

Are there a few cops/prosecutors who decided to knock on the wrong door to maybe solve another case? Quite likely, but it's going to be _much_ more limited in scope. Not to mention it could backfire in pretty ugly ways if their colleagues find them squandering limited time.


Too bad they didn't do it prior to this attack. Not that they wouldn't have attacked anyway but i will never understand why we're letting those supporter of ISIS and other enemies of our nation run around freely.

It's a bit like if Churchill decided not to arrest Nazi agent in London while they were at war with Nazi regime, that's beyond stupid.
Perpetual war on terror=perpetual state of emergency=continued erosion of constitutional rights=military-industrial-media-complex $profit.
FUCK POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. HUNT EM DOWN
Seems like a "state of emergency" is a much bigger deal in france than it is in the US.

In the US it usually doesn't mean much, but in France apparently it means curfews, warrantless searches, the military patrolling the streets of paris etc.
Muslims definitely aren't making the best case for themselves these days.
That's right, look at all the success that France is having by giving up their civil liberties.  Come on America, all you have to do is give up all your rights to freedom and privacy and corporate media can tell you about how the military found rocket launchers in YOUR neighbors house.
Deislamification.

Time to kick the terrorists out.
This isn't "radical jihad." it's just Islam. They've been at it for a thousand years. 

Thomas Jefferson fought Muslim pirates. They invaded Spain. The crusades were a reaction to their invasion. 

Just because not all Muslims kill, doesn't mean Islam is compatible with the west. 
I was expecting this to turn into an overreach of power and then...



rocket launcher
France just needs to follow the money, anybody that are receiving funds that originates from Saudi Arabia especially when a transfer is routed through several countries should be looked at.
Can't see this being abused.
Why wasn't this done before?
So wait , until the most recent attacks they were sitting on their hands just letting those in the movement do anything?
Sounds like a success. I don't recall the USAPATRIOT act ever finding a rocket launcher.
Search the fuck out of all of them.  Stop hiding behind your BULL SHIT religion.  
And that's how you get shit done.

Freedom's not so free anymore. 
Would be good to know how many of those arrested came over as migrants. 
If you were on the watch list before, I think you're on the interrogate list now.

Good, they should.  Anyone complaining is a paranoid fucktard
Can't wait for the cries of "Islamophobia". That should be fun for a certain party to play identity politics with.
Good.
We need to start seeing mass deportations of men aged 18-60 from certain countries.
Rocket launchers + police uniforms. Holy fucking shit.
A scene from walking dead last night " people will trade anything they have to feel safe" i thought about those bombing and what America turned into after 9/11. Now when people say it was an inside job, I don't think they are crazy and is extremely plausible. There were no government officials killed, and now they have all the money and the power. I'm not saying that this was an inside job, just that its possible. In fact I think the president was near one of the stadiums when one of the bombs went off so if it was i couldn't see a official putting himself in danger like that. 
A rocket launcher? Shit, how did they smuggle that bad boy in? 
As a french, i like the "state of emergency" because it give "more right" to our police.
I mean, basically our police have a lot of administrative shit to do before acting. but in case of emergency state, they can do more.
Sad we have to be attacked to give them the chance to do something :/

God damnit I applaud those people. Also russia
i just wanna remind everyone that the french are supporting this


they are supporting giving the police the right to kick down doors of people and check them out

cause france isn't full of a bunch of pussies with something to hide
A perfectly reasonable use of emergency powers to sweep up all the people they were keeping tabs on but didn't have evidence against. Hopefully itgoes a long way towards stopping these sick fucks. We'll save the tinfoil hat stuff for when these powers are actually abused.
Let me guess -- most of the suspects uncovered are French citizens by birth.
Here we go
See I'm reading that sentence and I'm like,  "Searches? Emergency powers? I am a principled liberal and I am not ok with this!" And then I get to the phrase, "rocket launcher discovered," and I'm like...shit.
I get the right to privacy, but if my house gets wrongly searched because of a new way to search for these punks who are out to cause a mass civilian massacre then by all means go for it. If even one attack was stopped in a wave of searches then it was worth it.

The people who scream "you can't monitor communications" are the same people who are going to scream "why don't you do more to stop this?" As soon as an attack happens. It's an unfortunate world we live in. But you can't have both anymore people.

The faster we all understand that the faster we stop some potential attacks.
Though this strikes at civil liberties, I think the majority of French people want this to happen to extremist on the "list". The UK has stopped many attack since heightening security. I never thought I would say this, but I don't mind the govnt snooping as long as it keeps us safe. But their needs to be a compromise and court ordered warrants. 
What if we created a transparency deal, where the govnt gets more abilities to spy, but we get to see more of where the money is going in our govnt. Our elections are 100% guaranteed. We should get transparency of they do. Thoughts? Elaborations?

Think of what they didn't find... I mean if they have more shit like this they might be trying to take on the law enforcement in a fight.
Get some!
Rocket launcher?! What the heck
False alarm, turned out to be a Nerf gun.
Good.
So a worthwhile temporary state of emergency then.
Good!
If you are found to publicly support ANY act of terrorism I feel like you completely forfeit your right to privacy in the country you reside in.

oh, so they're making the same mistakes the US made?

Wait what? France has declared a state of emergency allowing it's police to impinge on civil liberty in order to regain security...

Well shit! Doesn't that sound just like what the Israeli defense minister said was going to happen. Well, before worldnews Israel bashing community jumped in and torpedoed the discussion on what, apparently, was quite a reasonable observation on the impact of terror on civil rights.

Q
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1T35TpoXJ14
The warrant process should always be used. Even for pieces of Shit. 
Questioning them??  How about jail or deport them?
That's a better success rate than the US's TSA...
Don't go down this road France, take it from an American. Yes, you're people are scared and yes they may see this as a valid snap response, but it's not worth it.
Please can every country drop your stupid human right laws or any other bullshit laws and if you suspect anything just knock the door down and search. We're at war with people who are on our turf and hidden. Lock the fucker up as prisoners of war until the war is over. 
    "French police are using their new powers.....Over 150 searches executed." 

I read that as:

    "French police are using their new powers....Over 150 executed"
how convenient.
The issue is not emergency powers, suspensions of liberties in times of crisis or war. The issue is defining the circumstances under which to allow such power to be exercised and those powers being dissolved when aforementioned circumstances have passed.
well.

this should end well...
Just for voice of sanity: They discovered a rocket launcher, but there's no mention of finding rockets. A rocket launcher is pretty much a tube with a firing pin. 
They are going to trace this stuff back to dead ends in Germany, because German is far more intent on keeping Muslims happy.
I'm sure all Americans would gladly have given up all their freedom and protections sheet September 11th too.

After all, I'm sure there are more than a few privately owned ticket launchers there.
It'll start small. "We raided without a warrant," here; "we lie under oath in exchange for more power" there. Consolidation of power will happen small and it's going to grow exponentially. All this in the very, very near future if you don't stop it. The people are with you: the globalists are scared. 

A global economic system that causes terrorism: that is what the media is not addressing.

You need to look out for power consolidation: we've already had our 9/11 and we're in a different place in space and time right now. They're saying (the rich are saying this): don't continue your push to gain back what we've stolen from you otherwise more people will die.
This is how Liberty dies, with thunderous applause. 
new normal; police state with total power over individuals, and noone will bat an eye.
Its like a prison shake down 
They've gone batshit insane now. Not in a bad way, just they're going mental on revenge.
Some people are pissed that it is becoming a radical government, but guys remember that this is a state of emergency. Heck, I am against gitmo, but I suggest France to give extradition of terrorists to gitmo. 
Welcome to the official kick off of World War 3.  I say official because it's been going on for 14-15 years,  talk about a slow burn, cotton.

Civil liberties! Police state! Police brutality! A rocket launcher! oh ok 
150 searches and only 1 weapon found ? thats called harrassment
bbc is reporting that one of the paris attackers passed through greece with migrants a few months ago.  if there's no way to differentiate between the people actually trying to escape war, and the people actually trying to bring war into europe - what are these countries supposed to do?  cross their fingers?  their obligation is, first and foremost, to the security of their citizens, not foreign migrants.
I believe a cultural integration program should be held.

1. learn the language. young and didn't learn? bye bye.

2. kids must enter school with majority cultural natives. doesn't want? bye bye.

3. migrants must be spread out throuout the country, with a specific ration as to avoid guettos and culturally divergent communities. doesn't want? bye bye. 

4. think this is unfair and want to live as you did before? fine, go live where you lived before. can't? then accept the demands.
Greece has confirmed that one of the terrorists involved in last night's massacre is indeed a Syrian refugee. He was registered on Leros island in October. It is foolish to think that among the millions of Muslim migrants, most of whom are young men, there would be no jihadist recruits. 
We have family friends in northern Sweden (a good 600km away North from Stockholm). The wife is not Swedish as well as her son, and the husband is local. The town is tiny, friendly and safe like no other place I've seen so far.

They have refugees there. The refugees refused to eat what the centre provided, stating it is not what they 'can' (presumably because of religious beliefs) eat. So now Swedes are importing expensive foods for the refugees, most of which even the locals wouldn't afford on a daily basis. The wife, since she's much more sceptical and has a different upbringing, clearly said that the refugees were taking advantage of unsuspecting Swedes, knowingly doing this?

I know they run to save themselves and their families. But really, how far are they going to go with their demands? Soon you'll see laws changing to accommodate their beliefs.

I never thought this day would come as to me referring to Putin's words, but he was right when he said: the refugees who come to Russia need Russia. Russia doesn't need them. When they come to Russia, they should obey the laws of Russia. If they want Shaari (pardon my spelling) laws, they should go to the countries where that is the state law. If they come to Russia, they will have to speak Russian.

"This [multicultural] approach has failed, utterly failed"

*Angela Merkel*
*Potsdam, 16 October 2010 *
Go Poland! Don't let them fuck up your country, like our Swedish so called government has done.
About time someone did this. When you open the doors to migrants without first being able to identify the "good" from the "bad", it is a recipe for disaster. Poland needs to think about its citizens, first and foremost.
No country should be forced to accept people who they don't want there. 
I'm from Poland and immigrants don't give a shit about us. They are passing trough to Germany, France and UK. Poland is just a pit-stop. 

We are too poor to support our citizens so immigrants get almost nothing from us (just enough to survive). 

It's one reason on the short list of positive things about polish politics. 
On one hand I know these people are running from war, fleeing to provide a better future for their families. On the other hand I wonder how many terrorists are disgusied within the refugee groups, using the refugee crisis in europe as means of undetected passage.

With Poland not accepting migrants, more EU countries will follow suit. I 100% fully respect and support the decision of Poland and any country willing to do so, however, how will this impact on migrants and their choices? Their final gateway to hope will end up with a door slammed shut, leaving the only option to return home. IS will use this opportunity to further brainwash the migrants and add to their numbers. The situation at hand is completely fucked, whichever way you choose to view it.

EDIT: A word. 

EDIT 2: I am aware there are many homegrown terrorists carrying out the attacks and more waiting on orders to act. But still, I do not doubt for a second that IS is seizing the opportunity of migrants fleeing in order to station more terrorists around the EU. 
The member nations of the European Union have an obligation to their own citizens above all else. The unhindered flow of refugees into these countries is of far greater benefit to the refugees than it is to the citizenry. Are they prepared to assimilate such that in a generation they become indistinguishable in their values from native citizens? If not, then the leaders of the European nations are perpetrating well-intentioned treason against the very people from which they derive their power. This is a dangerously naive policy that will reverberate for generations if not stemmed soon. Full stop.  
  
edit: removed a letter.
I can't really blame Poland for this response. The risk outweighs the benefits unfortunately. Any thoughts????
Respect to Poland for standing up to the corruption and rotting core of the EU which is run by ultra liberals. The EU should beg Viktor Orban to take over the EU presidency.  He seems to be the only respectable and sane leader in power. 
The video included, the guy telling "it's not Islam"...

Why do people try so hard to deny it? To make excuses? It starts to annoy me greatly.
Migrants are already getting pissed that they aren't receiving the housing and accommodations they are promised by the smugglers. They expect middle class arraignments not a simple safe haven from a war torn country.  As soon as they get disenfranchised they will become terrorists. I understand you think you are a good person for wanting to help "refugees" but our cultures do not mix well and it is a bad idea to take in hundreds of thousands of people who already think you owe them something.  
So it begins...the migrant hot potato.
I have to say I'm not surprised.

As a nation we have a very rich history of fighting and dying for our own freedom and independence. We suffered more than many so-called first world countries in Europe. There are still millions who remember the Russian occupation. If they see something as a direct threat (which is exactly what forcing a large group of Muslim immigrants through the door looks like to them - whether you like it or not), they will not allow it. Period.

It may seem irrational to some but it's perfectly justified IMO. Don't try to force a change of mentality onto people who are not ready.
Poland putting on the pants!
Smart move, Poland.  


Germany against the rest of the EU. 
Refugee asylum should be a temporary thing.  All over the world, we should be ok with taking in refugees during a crisis, because the truth is it could happen to any of us, even in the west.  But it should always be a temporary thing, where after a crisis a change needs to be made in the original country so people can return.
Every country have its right to protect its own safety.
I definitely agree with Poland on this one. A majority of them are also not willing to learn the language, respect the culture and law, etc. I don't understand why they don't just go to countries that neighbor Syria. Due to the religion, culture, and customs being the same, there won't be any problems. Europe needs to close its borders now.
Poland is literally the last bastion for Europe. 
Every country have its right to protect its own safety.
Saudi Arabia taking in zero refugees but offers to build hundreds of mosques in Germany, how generous.
Good.
Poland is smart.
The Polish government is doing what it should. Protect the safety and security of their own citizens and look out for their own people first.

The tragic events in Paris showed weakness in Europe. Despite the strengthening of cooperation of European anti-terrorist services following the attacks in Madrid and London, Europe is still vulnerable to (successfully Asked blows to) [effectively targeted blows in] the asymmetrical war (against) [with] Islamic terrorism.

European countries must return to this topic.

The attacks in Paris [are] taking place in the immediate context of the (crisis, migration) [migration crisis] and the bombing of the French (position) [grounds by] ISIS and oil fields controlled by Islamists.

The attacks indicate the need for even deeper revision of the European policy on migration crisis.

Europe must urgently put on the agenda of migration demands of the EU's external border controls and the fight against the crisis at the source, in agreement with third countries. There is a need to intensify work on the program [of] readmission, which (should refer to any person to whom it is owed) [concerns every person not subject to] international protection.

(Our criticized) the EU Council decisions on the relocation of refugees and migrants to all EU countries [that we criticized] still have the status of (existing) [mandatory] EU law. In view of the tragic events in Paris, (but) we do not see the political (possibilities) [capability] of their execution.

Poland must retain full control over its borders, [and the policies] on asylum and immigration.
I recently read an interesting article (can't find the link) about so-called 'commonweal' vs. 'non-commonweal' countries.  The gist of it is that in commonweal countries (most explicitly seen in Northern Europe and the westernized Anglosphere) there is a long history of mutual trust in society, which generally leads to lower corruption, a high standard of living, and a generous welfare system.  Unfortunately, I don't think many well-meaning people in these countries can appreciate the stark contrast exhibited by some cultures, where the ideas of bribery, scamming for advantage, and  tricking those outside the inner circle of family and friends, are taken as a given.  'If lying will give me an advantage, I would be stupid not to lie.' And that's not even addressing the potential for terrorist infiltrations. We are all human beings, yes, but all cultures are not equal...
Poland yes!
Good decision, protect your own people.
Fantastic. The first EU member that is safe for tourists. Give me two more and I'll call it a vacation.
Finally a country with brains and balls. Protect yourself before you try to protect others. I'm all for saving lives etc., but many of these refugees are going to fuck up the very country that has offered them shelter. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. There are so many clowns who refuse to integrate into the culture, they refuse to eat what other citizens eat, they refuse to function like them.

Love to the guy who quoted Putin: "Refugees need Russia, Russia doesn't need refugees". 

Either leave your staunch religious beliefs behind or go somewhere else. You can be a good muslim even if you don't strictly adhere to the beliefs. 

And of course there are so many terrorists who are making use of the situation. Protect your own citizens first...
Brave, brave Poland. Somebody has to make a stand.
Good for you Poland. The rest of us should follow suite.

"High fences make for good neighbors".
To be honest most likely the terrorists will turn out to be second generation or even third generation born in France. I actually agree with the Poles for other reasons but France has had a homegrown terrorist threat for quite a while.
Terrorism works. Controversial, but true.
Nice to see Poland still has at least one functioning brain in its government.

As much as I'd like to have sympathy for the Muslim refugees and population, until they quit shielding these extremists and start turning them in, I wouldn't blame countries for not wanting to take them in and deporting them back to the middle east. The longer this goes on, the more we risk another "final solution" type of thing or the genocide that we saw in Bosnia not so long ago. And yes, American Christian extremists are just as bad and dangerous, they just haven't gotten to the level of the Muslim extremists.....yet. All religion is crap, sigh.
About time they started waking up.
As should all the nations of the EU. These economic migrants should focus on improving their own country instead of looking for handouts in other countries.
Good for them.
Good
The problem is Islam. The Mujahadeen was replaced by Al-Qadea, which has been replaced by ISIS. Some one will replace ISIS when they are eliminated. Why?

Because Islam. 


Poland's already accepted a fuckton of Ukrainian refugees earlier this year. Fuck Merkel for strongarming the rest of EU into dealing with her mess. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/ukraines-refugees-find-solace-in-poland-europes-most-homogenous-society

Thank God I live in Poland, we still remeber the Vienna Victory in 1683
At this point, you can't even lump them together as "migrants", since who knows how many of them are actually ISIS infiltrators. Block all borders, now. 
It is NOT racist to defend your nation. Let COMMON SENSE return and do away with political correctness. It is absolute insanity to jeopardize your country while letting an invasion take over. 
I'm glad people are finally awakening to the Muslim problem. I can't wait for Trump to win just to see reddit's reaction. 
It's 30x cheaper to provide aid and shelter to a single refugee in neighboring countries than to import and care for them in Western Europe. It's ironic that the do-gooders are actually helping less people with their policy of open borders in Europe.
For having a fairly liberal fanbase, Reddit sure gets conservative *real* quick when shit like this goes down
Poland is literally the last bastion for Europe. 
For once, I can be proud of my country - or at least for it taking step in right direction.

If you want the ~~refugees~~ the islamic economical migrants and conquerors, then go ahead take them all. 
And we say: no, thanks.

Please take all your political correctness along with it too.


Who the fuck wants to take in people who are afraid to fight for their country? I understand the elderly and children coming, but fuck there are tons of cowards.
Since when was it a priority to help migrants over the safety of your own citizens?  Their homes are fucked up, now they will bring that to their new destinations.  Fuck that.
Shut the door. Too bad. Stop the rape of europa. 
Poland never wanted these people and this is a great "excuse". And that's fine; imposing quotas on people might give refugees a home and be a good thing in the short-term but imposing them on a country will make for neither a happy host community nor happy, well-integrated former refugees.
Poland knows what it's like to get invaded.
HOLY SHIT!!! To all those who apply...with the utmost sincerity, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

I'm reading these top "best" comments and I feel like I want to cry with joy and pride. The level of thoughtful common sense and peoples understanding is uncommon here on reddit, at least in my experience. Calling people racists, xenophobes, Islamophobes etc. etc. simply because you understand and express your logical concerns about DEADLY serious issues of refugee migration and immigration in general, border security, debt etc. is heartbreaking. Europe is in DEEP DEEP trouble with migrants but don't think for a second that the US isn't heading in the same direction with our SUICIDAL immigration policies and current state of the nation in general. 

Many of our Western governments for what ever reasons have chose to destroy our nations. Place the citizenry in grave danger, the ONLY question is WHY? While I have my theories I don't pretend to know. What I do know is that if "WE" allow it the global chaos we're heading for will be monumental. 

There is NO doubt what so ever that the multiculturalism policies in Europe have FAILED completely. The evidence is plain to see. What is happening in countries like France, Germany, UK, Finland, Sweden, Belgium is ONLY going to get MUCH MUCH worse. A lot more blood will be spilled before things will get better...IF they do get better. A handful of nations have refused to follow the current insane marching orders to DESTROY their nation &amp; culture for the sake of absurd Utopian idea that humanity isn't ready for. That is WHY countries like Australia, New Zealand, Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia MUST be LOUDLY supported. 

Make no mistake, the 2016 US election is the most important election in the we've had in GENERATIONS here. It will determine whether US will have a CHANCE to reverse course and with MUCH luck save it's self from the destruction coming or whether our coffin gets it's final nail.

I pray ( figuratively ) that enough people will WAKE UP and that our government takes the hard steps necessary to save our nation. So, when Europe burns ( and it very likely will ) we'll be in a position to render help. Otherwise if you think the world is a dark place now, we'll be looking back on today wishing we ONLY could go back. Asking our selves, what the fuck were we thinking, how could we let it happen. 


The road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
Ironically, Poland seems to be one of the only countries dealing with the invasion in a logical manner
I'm perfectly understanding of that. I called a major attack happening this year as a result of this migration crisis and sure enough it happened. I know not all are bad and that the issue is extremists and not the general population, but this open borders nonsense was bound to see something horrible happen eventually. I think the solution is to go in all and wipe ISIS out with a major invasion led by NATO and with cooperation by any other nations wanting to assist. The time for half measures is gone. Full measures only from now on. Taking in refugees is a half measure because it doesn't solve anything.
Good for Poland, they are thinking of their own citizens first.
Hooray for Poland!
I love that when I sort this thread to "controversial" it is full of a bunch of politically correct idiots crying "RACISTISM"

well done Poland, everyone (that matters) supports you
Intelligent decision. Stay strong Polska, don't be bullied by Merkel. Many people are with you on this.
Merkel has blood on her hands.  I really hope that the citizens of Europe will just rise up and say enough!  Take your countries back.  I love France and visited numerous times and it saddens me that as the years go by, it seems less and less likely that I will visit France again.
Go Poland go!
I think the European Union unravels within the next 10 years
Common sense prevails!
Eastern Europeans aren't as infected with multiculturalism and feminism as their western counterparts, so they aren't terrified of taking a common sense stand.  Good for them for standing up to this politically correct BS and their historic homelands.

Sadly, I'm not very hopeful for the rest of the west.  A good portion appear willing to sell out their neighbors and piss on their parent's graves so they can boast about their compassion to other feckless, pale cowards.  
Smart move.  Now if the rest of the EU says the same thing we'll be in great shape.  And if the USA says the same even better
Nothing but their own fault tbh.    
Sure, it's just the bad eggs, but if they're not throwing them out, we can't tell the difference.    
     
Our pc attitudes will only go so far.
Can't blame them, their obligation is to their people first before any other. And when you can't really differentiate between refugees and terrorists sneaking in with them you gotta play it safe.
We should close the boarders here, Poland has the right idea 
Holy moly, I really hope Canada is more cautious with these people as well. Liberals passed a law that women can wear their full face masks during their citizenship oaths, so really, really hope that they wont start playing into this 'they're innocent victims' narrative.

Are the vast majority of muslims bad? I don't think so, but holy shit do they like to play the victim card or get offended if you criticize their faith, you draw their prophet by someone who lampoons everything? Fucking justify his murder and cry 'that's what he gets for hurting my feelings', then complain when things aren't adequate enough to their tastes, fuck I hate this two faced hypocrisy.
But shame on the US for cracking down on illegal immigrants. 
There wouldn't be any islamic linked terrorism in Europe if they didn't let muslims in. 
Wasn't one of the goals of the attacks likely to get European countries to stop taking in immigrants? It just seems like this might make groups like ISIS feel like these attacks are effective at accomplishing their goals. 
im 100% behind eastern europe countries not accepting imigrants if they choose to do so

if you could save 100k of them,its not worth it even if only one of them turns to violence of this scale...nobody should be forced to deal with this shit just because germany desperately wants to erase the image of hitler

in times like these being humanitarian can get you killed,its unfortunate but its true


Sadly, this is what terrorism does. Can you honestly just let people in  your country in massive numbers and not be a little wary when shit happens like what just did in Paris?
Tough situation.. Someone in the thread yesterday explained that the whole point of ISIS is to "bring about the end of the world". I guess part of that is driving a wedge between the world and them by being the boogey-muslims. Making sure everyone is scared of people that look like them so that these normal people are now afraid to live in the civilized world. 

It's like Check-Mate for the first match. EU really doesn't have a choice and ISIS got what they want. 


Personally, it seems like a propoganda game would be somewhat effective. Bring the west to them, education, technology, video games.. As it is now it's just a vicious cycle that goes in the favor of people who don't care about the value of life, who can't wait to die.

This thread is textbook liberal behaviour. It's got all the hallmarks: using the term 'racist' to shut down any argument, acting morally superior to anyone who disagrees with you, character assassinations etc. 

And it does the heart good to see them being shut the fuck up. I swear, liberals will bury their heads in the sand til the time comes to chop them off. I'm sorry but frankly I don't give a damn about the refugees if it means protecting the people of my own country. I do adore how left-wingers will always put any foreign entity on a higher pedestal than his fellow countrymen, not realising that every other foreign entity is just as patriotic and favoured towards their own. Stop it. I also marvel at how left-wingers are clearly privy to ISIS' plans, constantly asserting that their plan is of an infinitely more morally testing and philosophically straining fibre than one that's simply comprised of brute force. Stop. Even if it is true that ISIS is planning to instill fear and hatred of European powers within Syrian refugees, its basic risk assessment. If we let in refugees, some are bound to be ISIS supporters and terrorists, who will no doubt strike out at our respective national securities, murdering hundreds or more, while also still having us deal with threats from overseas. If we don't let in Syrian refugees, we'll still get attacked, but it won't be from Syrian refugees, it'll be from overseas, and we'll be encouraging hatred of us within those very same refugees. Either way, it seems the terrorists have already won, if the left have anything to say about it. How can we win with you leftards? 
Classic battle between the humanitarians and everyone who doesn't want their shit blown up. Isn't the argument let in refugees or else you're basically a xenophobic racist or something? 
respect to Poland from Lithuania.. eastern europe is the future of europe.. western and northern parts will become third world sh*tholes in a few decades when muslims will become majorities and will take over governments.. while our eastern europe will be free of this islamic cancer
Good job Poland, finally a country with common sense.
Good on Poland at least they aren't sheep going out of their way to say look how "tolerant and definitely NOT Racist" we are.  Like most other European countries.
One attacker has just been confirmed as an Syrian refugee.
Well done and Good job Poland.
Polan can into common sense
Who will be our John III Sobieski? 
I hope it won't be interpreted as racist - Poland simply refuses to play the game where elites use refugees to create a police state. It shows that Polish democracy finally works. Refugees on't get any rights in the west, and get abused and driven to radicalze - I feel extremly sorry for them, and I hope my country (Poland) supports them as much as possible, by sending humanitarian help and helping their countries on public forum like UN - but won't participate in any other NATO operations in middle east. Let us help them, not make situation even worse. I love you my dear muslim friends. I feel ectremly sorry that you are used as a political card in EU games.
good
In the meantime join the conversation in /r/Europe and get banned for 'hate speech' within three minutes.
Bye bye Schengen Agreement.

I wonder what it must feel like being a border guard in Hungary or Austria. You see these people at the fence and you want to help, but after yesterday's events you're looking at all of them as potential threats.

If it's them or me, then I'm going to protect my own. Let them freeze in the winter. They want free access to your shit so they can blow up your soccer games. Fuck that. 

Can a small group of assholes ruin the chance of life and safety for the millions of refugees? You bet.

It's not like you can turn these people to 21st century thinking anyway. All they know is the Quran. You can't have a quantum leap from 7th century mentality to the 21st. In the West we had our age of enlightenment.
Good.  We're finally having this conversation.
Please Europe, follow Poland's example! 
Depending on the source, the polls indicate between 13% and 39% of the "refugees" support ISIS. Even on the low end it's a lot of support though, admittedly, not all of that support would automatically translate into active participation in terror. 

Take Merkel's wet dream of letting 1.8 millions of the "refugees" to EU. Suddenly 13% looks like an army of over 230,000 people. Let's say a mere 1% of those would be ready to actually work for ISIS. That's 0.1% of the proposed quota, or 2,300 people.

The Paris attacks were perpetrated by 8. 


I respect Poland's decision. 
We warned Europe.  Now all the people that supported the migrant crisis are also responsible for the blood shed in France.
What do they say? An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure?  Holy shit, who'd of thought white Christian and liberal cultures would actually be better off with white Christian liberals living in them?

Multiculturalism does. Not. Fucking. Work.  How, as a westerner, can you live with a massive Muslim population if they think doing things like simply owning a dog as a pet is unclean and should be banned, drinking wine is a sin, or eating German sausages/proscuitto/ jamon shouldnt be allowed?
It's really getting difficult as a young and impressionable person to form a political opinion that coincides with my moral view. I'd like to think I will stand strong and defend the ideals our society was built upon and which were taught to me, but it is getting harder and harder to not break to exceptions.
The problem with these migrants needs to be fixed at the source. Even though the governments of the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia do not openly fund IS, members of these countries' royal families and aristocracy continue to do so while making a fortune of the US oil market. The only way IS and radical Islam can be stopped is by taking them out, but the US just puts too much value on its oil. If you stop IS, you stop the refugee crisis, and radicals disguised as refugees, its that simple.
Trudeau should learn from Poland
Better late than never. Its a tragedy for legit refugees but I fear this is just the beginning. Real people went to bed knowing that they were gunna do this massacre and they believed that a god would welcome them with paradise...
Good to hear that atleast V4 countries holding it together for Europe. I wouldn't hold my breath that western europe follows the same course though.
No no no, take them...Germany wants them so let them have them.
So proud to be pole!
Open borders is lunacy. 
Sorry migrants. our safety is more important than you. 
Good on you Poland. You actually care about the future of democracy and the well-being of European nations.

Get off that psychic high a lot of you pro-refugee cunts seem to be addicted to every time you say "MORE REFUGEES, YES LET THEM IN!" or "How dare you refuse refugees you xenophobic nazi." It's not just these radicals disguising themselves and committing the crimes and terrorist attacks like we have seen as of yesterday. It's also the antagonistic mindset of many of the Islamic peoples. They are flooding into these democratic nations after having been raised and cultivated in Islamic states/regions. Do you fuckin comprehend what makes up their culture!? No separation of church and state, no concept of innocent until proven guilty, inequality for women, executions for dropping the Muslim faith, widespread abuse to women and children of various forms, etc. 

Is that the kind of fucking people you want your children growing up around? Is this the culture you want your nations to adopt and be overwhelmed by? Those of you promoting multiculturalism with these people and politically correct mindsets, I have one thing to say to you. This goes for you as well government leaders of these EU nations accepting all the immigrants: the blood of 150+ people is on your hands just as much as it is on the terrorist Muslims from last night. If people don't wake up now, everything our ancestors fought for in Europe and America will be for nothing.
No muslims should be allowed entry into any modern country. This is war.
Good job Poland for defending the safety and culture of your own country. Hopefully more European nations will follow suit.
Of course this is exactly what ISIS wants--they use your own liberal laws, tolerance , and culture against you.  They know you'll tolerate mass immigration,  they know you have to tolerate freedom of religion due to PC, and they know you have to put up with multiculturalism.  That does nothing more than pervert your way of life and allows them to install people that will use all of that to their advantage and then commit terrorism in order to make Europe tear itself apart.  How's it feel to have your own tolerance used against you?  Tell you what, if you're Christian try going into Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan and preaching your religion and customs in the hopes of converting it to a Christian nation.  It'll only be a matter of time before we see your beheading video on YouTube.  Why tolerate an intolerant religion and culture?
The refugees should stay and fight for what is theirs. It seems as if nobody in the Middle East is willing to fight/work for anything...except for the extremists.

Iraqis won't fight to for their countrymen outside of their own villages, afghans won't fight for anything except them selfs and if everything returning servicemen have said is true they will sale their mother for a modest profit. Apparently Syrians won't even fight for their homes. 
good decision, hope they stick to it
Finally a none-spineless country.
Good for you Poland... If the Fox is going in the Hen House why does his color matter?
I have a bad feeling that Germany is going to deal with some very deadly attacks in the near future. 
Finally a EU country with some balls. Every other EU country is like "you gave us a bloody nose? I really hope it didn't hurt your hand". Syrian people need help but putting up with this invasion is lunacy. 
Well a Syrian passport was found on one of the bombers at the soccer game (reported by CNN this morning).  Connect the dots.
Ban the burka.

Monitor all mosque sermons. 
Good. Left wing pc sjw policy has failed the EU.

Most people saw this coming but the liberals don't want to offend anyone. As long as its other people paying the cost with money and lives oh well!!!
In threads like this, people should have a flag that says where they're from. Would make it a lot easier to see who to take seriously. 

EDIT: I'm not taking sides with the above comment. I'm saying it cause it helps determine how valid an opinion is and how based on experience it is, that's all. 
If I was a leader of a country, I wouldn't take any migrants in either.  I'm no fool, I know plenty of them just want to get as far away from the bullets as they can.  But at what point does the risk to my own people become too great?  I can't tell if old Achmed over there wants to blow up a school, but if there's a 1 in 1,000 chance, then that's not a risk worth taking.
It's only racist when America does it.
Good, fuck the immigrants 
Western culture needs to take a step back and realize what is happening. You can't try to install western culture in these assbackwards countries. Then, train their militaries and arm a ton of different groups with loads of weapons. And god knows who's hands these weapons will end up in.  THEN, fucking open up your borders in a country that is "gun free".  This is a perfect recipe for disasters like this.

These terrorist had all the time in the world to slaughtered all these innocent people. The police with all the weapons took over 2 hours to repond. 

Sadly increased intervention in the Middle East will continue happen and things will likely get even worse. 
These so-called "refugees" remind me very much of the Puritans that fled Europe from religious persecution. As soon as they came to the US, they tried to instill *their* religion on the local populace. 
Good! Keep them out of my homeland. I understand people wanting to escape. The problem is they just create the same monster wherever they go. The UK is falling from within, forced underage marriages, wife beatings, hymen reconstruction, polygamy, 20+ unloved or cared for kids. Some guy strangled his wife in Arizona after she fled a forced Muslim marriage.
I can understand giving refugees decent living quarters, an education, and food that doesn't go against their religious beliefs. That's fine. But if they are demanding better housing, food for any reason other than religion, or trying to have local laws changed to accommodate their belief system, then that's when the government needs to put their foot down. I also hear a lot about local media not reporting ethnicity of perpetrators when the ethcity is some kind of middle eastern. Or they dont report on the crime. Withholding information because it doesn't suit the narrative you want to portray, is not okay.

This is what you get and if you don't like it, leave. This is paid for by our citizens. Many of whom have less than this. Give them just-above-the-poverty-line living standards. They can learn the language, find local work, and better themselves by integrating into society. If they don't want to, they can go. 

I wish the EU and USA could figure out better means of providing safe passage for refugees leaving Syria. They would be in control of this migration and could regulate more means of background checking the refugees they carried. 
Instead of fighing for their homeland they run away and seek shelter else where. But they disregard the kindness of the countries that hosts them and still abide by their moronic religious belief over the laws of the land. You offer a helping hand and recieve ignorance. 
THIS is the proper response.

Not pretty colored lights or Facebook Likes.

To anyone, especially Americans etc, who critique Poland for this; YOU take the refugees. YOU give them a house, food and money. Not your country, not your city, YOU. It's so easy to say we are terrible for not wanting to help but what are you doing? We didn't start the war nor are we responsible. Anything we do for them is extra. 
Before you can come as an immigrant you owe me 100 ISIS scalps. 
BASED POLAND IS BASED
Really makes me grateful as an American that we give the illusion of open doors when in reality they're closed and locked pretty tightly.  
Then stand with Hungary and reject them.
Good
Just a guy from Scotland here! I was all for supporting refugees when that whole thing kicked off.  However I said from the first minute, it's a little concerning that a Wolf could easily be amongst the flock of sheep, and that also.. I believe Cameron gave in to it too quickly, suggesting that there was gonna be a plan for later on. Ie. "act of terrorism"  happens, Cameron blames "immigrant influx", entirely shuts off our 4 countries to all outsiders and we get raped by his bacon scented wee willy. 

Then again, I just fucking hate the prick.
Wouldn't be surprised some are these are the ones that left Europe initially. **"Chickens come home to roost"**. Mistakes are on the so called "ally" Turkey. Which allows the terrorist to flow freely as long as they are not Kurdish people.

fuck yea!
The Hussars will ride again
Anyone who thinks the refugee policy that the EU was pushing is still going into effect, they are blind to the local politics of the nations that make up the EU. It would be quite short-sighted of the EU to risk their  existence over this.
Oh it feels so good to be right about everything. Bye bye E.U. 
I will never say that Poland stemming the flow of migrants is unrealistic, but let's take everything in context. IS operates via a cell based structure more horizontal than vertical--more decentralized than directly controlled--but there is a fundamental strategic and ideological similarity nonetheless. They all have varying convictions leaning towards violence, but if they can walk and shoot, they likely have the capabilities of common sense. These aren't idiots. They're people, and they knew what the international response would be. It would not surprise me if they assumed (correctly) that France (already fringing upon very anti-Islamic rhetoric) would be flung headlong into anti-immigration and anti-Islamic fervor because of these attacks. In doing such, we give IS control of our moral considerations. Control of our obligations and control of our refugee policies--in ways they expect, and in ways contrary to reason. To expect screening to be wholly infallible is idiotic. But this uncertainty has always existed. Many a terrorist attack has been conducted by terrorists who hsve slipped past borders, or refugee screening, all in times of far less refugee flow. And to argue that the migrant crisis is more succesful in the spread of extreamist violence is--as of yet--unfounded in the grand scheme. Assuming there are more terrorists because there are migrants seems silly. Again, IS knows that, with our reactionary behavior, we will destroy any grey areas in public opinion. That we will demolish the chances of the public viewing these migrants as potentially productive individuals, and instead cause the public to treat them as a threat.

Every instance of national  is followed by a wave of conservative and reactionary actions. These aren't always wrong, don't misunderstand me. But they are *always* the national course of action, and IS knows this. And how many times have these courses of action stopped the influx of violent extremism prior to the refugee crisis? 

And to be clear, yes, Poland should do what is needed for domestic security. And yes, the world needs to seriously examine any potential relationship between the migrant crisis and the possible spread of violent extremism. But no, we should not allow reactionary and conservative rhetoric to cloud our thoughts. We should not unintentionally play into the hands of militants. And we should absolutely not give these bastards control of our moral response to international crisis. The migrant crisis itself is merely a symptom of the problem. The problem itself needs to be addressed--the problem related to both the increase in militancy and the influx of asylum seekers and refugees world wide. And an overly political and overly narrow reaction will prevent that problem from being addressed 

Additionally, I'd like to point out that IS very much wants to foster the notion that they can be anywhere, at anytime. They operate internationally in a decentralized format, but always under the same operational principles so that there exists constant worry as to where the next strike may or may not be. But by their nature, they operate via a collection merely interrelated cells. Homegrown terrorism is a thing. I would not doubt that there are groups utterly unaffiliated with IS in all but their own personal claims, and thus separate from this migrant crisis. They may exploit it for greater access, sure. The question is, how do you stop that sort of nebelous threat? And more importantly,how do you stop it while avoiding the typecasting of Muslims and racially related demograohics on a national scale? Because this is what organizations like IS want. We all realize how multicultural terrorism is becoming, but let's not pretend that when we all read that erroneous story about four heavily armed being chased through the outskirts of Paris, we didn't see four brown men with AKs. We did. But that alone is increasingly becoming an obsolete face of terrorism.
Bravo Poland, things like these makes me proud. 
I don't think anyone blames them. Considering the Paris attacker was a "Refugee". All countries should put the welfare of their citizens first. 
There is another reason to don't "invite" migrants to Poland. They just don't want to go there, because of grants wich are smaller than in Germany or Sweden. They will go abroad in first occasion, how and why shoud you stop they? There was such an incident in Poland with one of migrants (who has been adopt by a family).
I wonder what will happen when we will find that attackers were not from Syria or Iraq.

I guess ISIS achieved making it a cultural problem and installing fear of migrants in EU.
I dare to hope, but is this some common sense the EU is showing?
Bravo Poland!  Many will hopefully follow suit and force these people to band together and take their own country back.
This is exactly what ISIS wants, isolationism and hatred. I couldnt imagine being a refugee with no home, no place to go, and to immediately be targeted the same as the terroritsts who did this.
Way to go Poland. Hopefully the rest  of EU will follow suit. 

This is awesome. 
Well done. Stand up against the insanity.
[Situation right now](http://x3.cdn03.imgwykop.pl/c3201142/comment_ZCMO5GUZSg0NhKha1x0BrhwZGXegiIwQ,w400.jpg)
I agree with Poland. Go fuck yourself you left wing cunts.
Greek minister Toskas confirms Paris attacker w/ Syrian passport was registered as refugee on Leros island in October.

Considering this, it makes sense. 
Good for you, Poland. I wish my country would do the same, but our government's tongue is so far up Merkel's ass they can't even use it to speak. 
Accepting immigrants is ok but to be safe countries should only accept Females of any age and absolutely no Males.

They have a better chance of fiding a man that will support them and a lower risk to buying a AK 47 and blowing themselves up.
Good! Wise up and stop giving your society over to murderers. You can't placate them, so get rid of them.
I will enjoy some polish sausages today in honor of this wise decision. Cheers to you, Poland. 
Poland has their shit together.  Been to France recently? The Champs Elysée looks and feels like you're in fucking Saudi Arabia and not France.
The UK should close it's borders too. 

It's high risk at the moment.
I hate to say it but I'm surprised it took so long for a massive massacre to take place with Europe's borders being wide open. ISIS themselves have TOLD us they were sending in fighters among the refugees, in fact they claim to have sent thousands of fighters to Europe so this could be just the beginning.
See thats what you get and the libetards denied it from day one. This is another step in the fractioning of the EU. Dont let these immigrants in Europe expel them all. 
Excellent use of common sense, Poland. Keep your people safe!

Immigrants be like  "gibs me dat" 
Fukkin A
Finally, some common sense. 
Didn't a terrorist attack just kill like 200 people on a Russian plane? No one really even cared about that after a couple days. 100 people get killed in an attack and the world is going to shit now? 

What the hell. 
Finally a country with some balls.
Islamophobia and reaction in the West is an explicit strategic goal of ISIS. Their propaganda talks explicitly about eliminating the 'grey zone' of those with moderate attitudes to Islam, both inside and outside the religion, via the fomenting of mutual hate. In the long-term, I doubt ISIS can survive the constant assault they are under (not least by Kurdish forces) for very long, but in the short term they are well served by an upswing in anti-Islamic and anti-immigrant bigotry. 

That, I think, is the point to emphasise; ISIS is sickly and deliberately co-dependent with the Western right wing. Those who are giving in to paranoia and bigotry are playing precisely into their hands. If you, as a regular European citizen, want to hurt ISIS, march against fascism here.
Asylum is something that is granted. I don't think anyone has the "right" to asylum.

And with that I can accept that many countries are wary and don't want to accept anyone (which is rational).

In Germany we have cases where Christians and Yazidis are attacked in refugee shelters.


Small villages (100- 500) get 1000 to 2000 refugees next to them without any notice or information.
Haven't read the comments, but I'm going to guess the SJW's on here are going to whine and make the usual excuses...

Fucking sick of these idiots already. Why the hell would you defend people who would most certainly go against everything you believe in, in their communities? Do you think Islam cares about homosexual, feminist and religious rights?
And they dont have to accept any. Good for Poland for keeping Poland Polish
Apparently, the attackers spoke perfect accentless French. Why take it out on the refugees? This is exactly what IS wants, no?
For people who didn't know:

The UK was *already* participating in military action in Iraq 

and now join USA, France, Russia etc fighting in Syria.
60 Labour MPs voted for Airstrikes despite Corbyn voting against.
I hate the fact Cameron called people who voted against strikes "terrorist sympathisers".

Agree or disagree on the strikes but that is a bullshit statement.


I'm both surprised and not surprised by some things:

1. Do people really believe that there are 70,000 moderate rebels in Syria? How is it that the US spent $500 million and could only train "four or five" rebels? 

2. How is it that there is no discussion of those countries that feed the ISIS beast? I'm talking about Turkey, Saudi Arabia, etc?

3. How is it that you decide to bomb a country without any sense of what to do afterwards? Who will rule Syria if Assad is gone? How is this not a replay of Iraq and Libya?



My right honourable friends. 

As someone who has had nothing better to do all day but watch the majority of these debates take place and listen to countless opinions for and against over many hours. I am mentally and emotionally exhausted. I come away with the feeling that this was no easy decision for anyone in the houses of parliament today although I do not include the party leaders in that thought as they clearly have agendas . 

I am talking about the MP'S who have represented their constituencies. Some who spoke with a lot of emotion. 

My concerns coming away from today are the "supposed" 70'000 Free Syrian Rebels quoted by Cameron who play a vital role in the government's strategy, of taking territory and co-operating with Britain . Rebels that he himself was quoted as saying may not all co-operate, because of the divides of factions from within. 

For me this is a very wishy washy strategy when you cannot  give people a certainty in numbers of those who will actually co-operate with your strategy on the ground. As of now the only certainty we have with us are the Kurds. 

Another big issue is the amount of civilian losses these airstrikes will entail. Arguments against state that civilians in these Cities will be used as Human Shields by Daesh, which we all know is a certainty and arguments for state that civilian casualties are happening and will continue to happen  regardless. 

Other criticisms included the fact that our supposed allies in the middle east and notably Jordan had pulled out from the striking Daesh and although the end game plan was stated to be one of overthrowing Assad within the next six months and installing a new syrian goverment within the next 18 months. I heard no concrete plan put forward as to how that would exactly be achieved. Along with that fact that our Allies Russia want a different outcome from this. 

Personally I would have voted against this motion. The plan of action seems overly optimistic in regards to rebel support and co-operation and that in 18 months Syria will have a new government in power seems unrealistic at this time. My predictions from all that I heard today will inevitably be the inclusion of our ground forces at some point in the next year. It's whether Cameron puts that to a vote or not. 

Special Thankyou to the person who gilded me :) and its my pleasure to those who thanked me for the summary. 
ISIS has also had a vote

http://i.imgur.com/TjUgWU8.png
MPs have voted to attack Islamic State group targets in Syria. The results of the vote was:

Ayes - 397

Noes - 223

Majority - 174
This after Cameron had said on October 4th that Russian bombing would "lead to further radicalisation and increased terrorism."
I assume that British bombing, and that of her allies, will not do this then?
I do agree that _something_ should be done, but now by bombing them Cameron has put the UK, a country where we know some of the terrorists have come from, in the firing line.
Perhaps more attention should be put on crippling the organisation at source, by stopping their source of funds, rather than just bombing them?
Only once has bombing won a war - over Japan with nuclear weapons. 
I am gravely concerned that this is a knee-jerk reaction which will backfire spectacularly, a la Iraq, Libya, Afghanistan, etc.
Syria's just going to be one gigantic shell crater at this rate. Like a rubbish dump for peoples bombs. 
397 - 223 in the Government's favour. Not enough Tory rebels.
I dislike this decision, but only because it doesn't get to the root of the problem.  This is Iraq circa 2003 all over again; what the hell do we do once we've bombed Syria and cleared ISIS from the region?  Do we install some new leader in the vein of Maliki, who will just go on to fuck things up even moreso than they were before?

There probably really isn't an answer for the question, and if there is, it isn't going to be found by applying our ideas of democracy and governance to a region that they aren't suitable for.  

I get the feeling that this is going to be the defining issue of my generation, as the world begins to deal with the harsh realities of globalization.  
I like how everyone's forgotten that the UK has been doing airstrikes in Iraq for years and years before and after ISIS. In fact they are still are. Has it changed anything? Has it made the UK or Iraq safer?

So let's follow the same strategy in Syria. I'm sure it'll work out this time. If not they can just bomb Libya or Iran or some other country in 3-4 years' time when everyone has gotten tired of Syria.

The West will never learn. They're the ones ultimately responsible for this mess and that's why it will never end. Their own leaders wouldn't want it to.
Speaker - "We come now to the petition"

*Everyone laughs and leaves.*

I hate politicians, I really do.
Kurdish people thank Britain for this decision. 

We are your boots on the ground, we have liberated dozens of towns and hundreds of villages from ISIS. 

It will be the YPG and their Arab allies in the umbrella group of the Syrian Democratic Forces that will liberate Raqqa, the ISIS capital. 

We also need heavy weapons, airstrikes are vital as seen in Kobane and Shingal, but they are always done in combination with the boots on the ground who have heavy weapons needed.

Arm the Kurdish people, we are on the frontlines of humanity.
Aw shit son, the band's back together!
And this has worked *so* well for the last 15 years.
RIP those civilians that were deemed collateral damage.
**14 years of non-stop bombing and we now have more terrorists than before...but I'm sure this time it'll work! Right?**
I didn't want us to bomb syria. TIL that makes me a terrorist sympathiser 
No money so we have to cut money for the NHS, police, mental health, school and benefits but of course we *have* to join the bombing campaign in Syria and spend a tonne. I'm all for wiping Daesh from the world but it's the surrounding countries who should be taking the job not us, but it's not in their interest so :/
I have a very bad feeling about this
I can't help but feel that these airstrikes have been wanted or even planned by British intelligence for a while now, but it's taken the attacks in Paris to generate enough support for the proposal to be made public.
Terrorism is too integrated domestically to cull with one misguided mission to wipe Syria clean. Call me pacifistic, but think of the civilian losses. It's just not going to 'sort' everything the way the majority appear to think it will 'sort' everything. It's bizarre jingoism that I thought the world was too learned and apathetic to stomach again.
Yea, if you ask me they're just looking for a place to dispose of their bombs. What happens when you 'dispose' your bombs. Well you need more and that cost money. Perfect! :D
Purple rain.... Purple rain.....
Why can't Cameron be more like those other leaders and be content fucking up just the one country.
Is there a list of who voted for and who did against this madness? Thanks!
Was only a matter of time until the crooks at downing Street dragged us into this proxy war, between the USA and Russia. 
**Lister:** You wiped out the entire population of this planet?

**Rimmer:** You make it sound so negative, Lister. Don't you see? The deranged menace that once threatened this world is vanquished.

**Lister:** No it isn't, pal; you''re still here.

**Rimmer:** I've brought about peace. Peace, freedom and democracy.

**Lister:** Yeah, Rimmer. Right. Absolutely. Now all the corpses that litter the battlefield can just lie there, safe in the knowledge that they snuffed it under a flag of peace and can now happily decompose in a land of freedom. You smeghead.
I have been convinced by the arguments of Tim Farron MP. Air strikes, if applied properly, are a good course of action to inhibit Daesh.
Those must be some seriously advanced missiles to hit targets in Syria and stop extremists in Europe.

Impressive.
I like how we (The UK) cut spending in almost every sector imaginable to save money.... and then we go on and spend billions on bombing the Middle East. Ashamed the way the government has acted today, sad day for democracy. 
Death to you playa haters
Let's spend a load of money on weapons to fight the guys that are using the last weapons we left there. It's not like we will miss any targets, terrorise the local population or end up in a proxy war with russia. Heck if we're lucky maybe the young people watching their parents die in an misguided missile won't sign up to the next big group that forms following this crisis. What could go wrong?

But hey, at least now we're involved this will make ISIS unable to attack us at home

Coming up next: Why do they hate us and our culture?
and i suppose this makes syrians vote in favor of isis-attacks in uk.

cant blame them.
Isin't Russia the only country who syria allowed into their air space? 
Apparently if a recent poll is to be believed, the British public is not overly enthusiastic about yet more bombs being dropped on the middle east, yet the politicians go ahead regardless, since they know best, after all, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya have been such successful interventions haven't they.

(well, if the aim was to create war-torn, divided countries that keep their oil prices down, then i guess they have been successful interventions)
I love how the reasoning behind more killing is to keep us safe. Has everyone forgotten that the last time we invaded to keep everyone safe has lead to this day again. But this time there's a shit load more terrorists and they are entrenched all over the world. It didn't work then and it won't work now. You can't dig yourself out of a hole with bombs. 
ISIS is a red-herring, the British endgame is the removal of Assad which means we're on a collision course with Russia. The only reason we're going over is because Russia has been hammering our assets over there. 

This is really shameful, just look at who we're allying ourselves with. These so-called moderates are war criminal terrorists, Turkeys involvement is reprehensible. The entire NATO/western orchestration of the destabilising of Syria is nauseating and now we strike our superhero pose and charge in, ostensibly to help sort out the mess we created but in actuality to create further chaos.

My only beef is the fact we're going up against Russia, if they weren't there i couldn't care less what action we took.
This is a mistake.
I see people so offended by this idea while forgetting that we have currently been bombing Iraq with this mandate simply extending the firing range.

ISIS attack the west to make us afraid of retaliation. This is a holy war; an ideological war between hard-pressed Islamic and the secular west.

Who will deal with Isis if not the west? Their surrounding territories are happy to buy their oil, and care little for the human suffering accrued by the expanse of ISIS. The death of homosexuals; genocide of Christian; the suspension of all human rights in the region - what are we to do? We are being torn apart by our own fear of retaliation and war.

Britain made the mistake once of stepping aside as a group of madmen swept their way across territories while suspending human rights and committing huge atrocities and only when it was too late did we act. More lives were lost by our lack of early action. Hitler was no different than ISIS. An ideology of hate.

Unfortunately all the tweets and liberal love fests won't stop terrorism nor will it stop the spread of these ideologies. Only war will stop the spread of genocide in Syria and the surrounding territories now.
Fuck paying tax for this shit. 
In the immortal words of Basil Faulty:

Oh spiffing!
"Hey guys! Do you remember that time we bombed the Middle East and it made everything better?"  "No."  "Let's do it again and see what happens anyway!"
How does this make the streets of UK safer is what I ask. 
I can't see anything but more death and hate coming from this decision.
Isis is an ideology, you can't bomb an idea. 
I wonder what it feels like to be some ISIS fuck, cowering in some blown out house, when you find out "oh, great, the UK has voted to bomb us further into the stone age", and you wonder what comes before the stone age, right about the time you hear the jets overhead...
I want to get of Davids wild ride. 
I think I am the only person out of everyone I know who thinks military action in Syria is a good thing, if handled correctly. ISIS are expanding, they're making their way into Europe, and it's become more than just taking over areas of the Muslim world, they are attacking the Western way of life, killing European citizens and they want nothing more than to make us suffer.

Every time ISIS performs an attack on European soil, and we do nothing, it's a good advertising campaign for ISIS, to other Muslims from that part of the world it may seem like they are "winning", drawing up more interest, and creating more and more soldiers, strengthening their forces and personnel. We need to get in there and kill every single one of them before they become so big that it's too difficult for us to take them all down. Obviously, killing innocent civilians is an atrocious thing, and I feel like boots on the ground from the US, UK, France and Russia would be a better way of preventing this, but I just hope we can carry out these strikes and actually do some damage while protecting the lives of innocent Syrian people.
A sad day for the UK in my opinion, more unnecessary killing with no real plan on how to stop ISIS put in place. A majority of MP's must think dropping bombs has helped out in Libya . 
This is exactly hat ISIS wants. Why do exactly what your enemy wants?
A successful terrorist attack on the UK is inevitable, and it WILL be blamed on these airstrikes by the general public. (I personally believe it is happening whether we bomb or not). Are they just ignoring the political ramifications of that? 
Dual mode Brimstone II

Only used by the RAF. The yanks admire them greatly.

Only fitted to our Tornado GR4' soon to be fitted to our Typhoons.

We can start with the oil tankers Turkey claims don't exist. 
We did it reddit! 

*Sigh* see you next recession.
Is there going to be a mass protest against this that I can join?
Cameron: 'Hey guys how did Iraq work out?' 
Philip Hammond: 'Not well chief.'
Cameron: 'Let's do it all over again!'
no money for the NHS, no money for housing, no money for education. Money to bomb a country already bombed to fuck. Good job pig fucker.
Right, I'm prepared for the downvotes. In no way do I condone the violence on either side, the guerilla warfare or the airstrikes.

However stop and think what they think of us. Just consider it for a moment. We know that Saudi funds terrorism. That much has been proven. They feed us oil so we smile, and they give that money to their religious zealot friends.

So - what did we do. Well, Iraq and Afghanistan for one. We waded in to Iraq on the pretence we would create a democracy. We devastated an entire nation. The males of the country were denied work because it was sub-contracted to Jordanians working under the American banner. They were never given the opportunity to think what kind of nation they wanted in the place of Saddam's. Baghdad used to be a TOURIST resort. A beautiful city, now it is nothing. We forced our way in, destroyed the country, fundamentally ripped out the economy based on a western ideal that the people could never take to. Afghanistan used to also be a nice country. We ravaged the fuck out of it.

For a moment, sit back and think what these people think of the west. It isn't hard to imagine the deep seeded hatred they must feel for our culture and ultimately our religions (they see us as Christian Nations which we predominately are) so they are able to incite their own people into extremism. Ideas do NOT disappear with bodies. All we are doing here is feeding their people more reason to hate us. Its a massive shame. I'm not a sympathiser, I fucking hate Islam (among all other religions) I hate terrorists, but it's not difficult to see exactly why they've started this and what the world has become as a result. Keep putting out these little fires around Saudi and all we're doing is making the flame brighter elsewhere. Eventually it'll be a mass scale uprising from the entirety of the middle east and then we'll be fucking sorry. I guarantee it.
Bombs can't kill ideologies

I am willing to bet there will be British, American, French and possibly Russian troops in Syria in the next few years, and I can't see it going well.
Complete knee-jerk reaction. I was listening all day and I don't think I heard anyone in the Aye camp explain what exactly the next step is after beginning the air campaign. So now there are bombs dropping, what next?
As a syrian this is utter shit. Bombing "isis areas" will result in inocent casualties and that should not be accepted.

Edit: for idiots talking shit , the war started as a fight for power between the government and multiple other parties , note that i am with none of the sides im with the people , the civilians. The fight is equal right now. The only real losers are the people getting blown up and shot right and left. So don't tell me to "control my territory" that really sounds very ignorant.

Anybody know what the purpose of this is?
So what defines a World War?
Sympathetic to their aims, not necessarily their methods. If you want to compare ISIS to the IRA then you're a fool 
Im still trying to figure out how all these extra airstrikes are not killing people held hostage by ISIS. I don't hear the media even mentioning anything about it.
How many millions will this cost? I sincerely hope Australia does not waste their resources on this shit.
Yeah and USA is putting boots on the ground. Do we get a say in anything? 
Better than troops on ground
Having never heard parliament in session being an American, it was rather colorful. Felt like I was listening to a Dr. Who episode, and not just because of the accents. 
Is this symbolic support, or are they actually going to do something? How many fighter jets are they going to send over?
Two great speeches, one from Hillary Benn. (www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/watch-hilary-benns-extraordinary-speech-6944024#rlabs=2%20rt$sitewide%20p$1)

and one from Dr Julian Lewis (www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/syria-vote-julian-lewis-gives-6942338)

Both from different sides of the debate, both from parties the majority of which voted against their speeches.
Against whom?
And then what

The key is that they chose to extend their air campaign, not just establish it. 
Must be nice to have a congressional body vote before taking military action...
Hey at least they voted on it before they started bombing shit. That's more than I can say for how things have worked in the US for the last half century.
If they are killing the junior varsity team i'm all for it!
You don't change horses mid-stream.

Hopefully ,the Airstrikes will be successful in reducing the power of the enemy greatly so that not only the UK but the whole world will be a safer place.
the UK is joining all the cool kids. 
more decisions need to be made by the majority. If this were a referendum, im not so sure if a majority would have supported it.

Now obviously entities like the parliament are voted in so the majority doesn't have to vote on every little thing.

BUT

imo, i think the people of any country have a lot more time than most would think for important issues that come up.
Thank god.  Now we don't have to rename English Muffins 'freedom muffins'.
Wow, this point in the video, excuse music, shows multiple launches....earlier in the vid there is footage of a launch from a jet which immediately arrows down...very odd.

Straight for the oil fields!!!! Dickheads... 
is syria a crater yet?
It makes me feel sick that children will be killed in these bombings. This may sound like a stupid question but why do civilians get caught in these bombings? Do they bomb public areas in which they think isis are hiding in or what? 
Welcome to WWIII
Too Many Cooks Spoil the Soup
Without Corbyn, we would both not be anywhere near where we know some of the great UN.
So we have had at one time or another Syrian army, America, Russia, France, UK, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and turkey bomb syria. Thats 10 factions, is there any other point in history where 10 different countries are conducting operations in one area?
Nice to see them all laughing mid results- I mean what a hilarious moment in history. Bunch of pricks.
Only 3% of Scottish MP's voted for this. Don't blame us.
[For those who want to understand why exactly the US is so eager to expand operations in Syria](http://ftmdaily.com/preparing-for-the-collapse-of-the-petrodollar-system/)
Why don't we make a law where any MP who wants to go war, has to fight. And their children have to fight. And anyone from the public who voted or is in favour, has to fight and agree that they will take in refugees into their homes after the fighting. How about that?
I am very disappointed with my Government today.
I don't agree with everything Corbyn says, his view on unilateral nuclear disarmament is to me, insanity, but i've been left open mouthed in wonder at the way half of the Labour party have reacted to a genuine left winger, the very type of politics that made Labour the working man's party, gave them the NHS and decent working wages.

How far they have drifted to the right is amazing, what is the fucking point of having two right wing parties to choose from?  I'm starting to think that there wasn't enough space for a truck-load of right-wing career politicians in the Conservative party, and they had to reluctantly join Labour in order to get on the gravy train that is parliament, it's utterly bizarre.  

They got comfy the last couple of decades with Labour as a 'tory light' option, and now they scream bloody murder when the party tries to return to the people it was meant to represent
2 years ago Cameron lobbied to bomb Assad, now he lobbied to bomb Assads enemies. How has no one brought this up?
Am I the only one that feels like acts of war shouldn't be handled through a vote?  

I'm all for democracy, but war requires a clear head that makes the best decisions not a bunch of people who might have other agendas than actually winning the damn thing.

Imho, whether war is waged or not should go through a vote, but actual plans and decisions should be fully on the responsibility of a commander in chief.
I seriously think this is a bad idea.

Russia, and France (the main two), and more are already there bombing up the place and taking it seriously, why should we add to the damage and deaths of innocent civilians of their country? 

To add, all these air operations are going to cost us a hell of a lot of money, why should we fight fire with fire when we could have used that money in investing into things like our health or education sector? We could have made more jobs too by investing in infrastructure

Wont this make Britain closer to the top of ISIS's 'hit list'? what is there to prove that they wont retaliate in one way or another very soon?

My last point, the ones in favour for these air strikes will I bet you be the ones to first say "We dont want immigrants", you cant bomb up a place, ruin peoples land and homes and not expect them to flee to the west and I dont blame them either.
 
Britain is just making more problems for them selves.
I have one question - Why is there so much opposition to the UK starting airstrikes in Syria? - when they've been doing it in Iraq for months, and the USA, France, Russia (and other nations i believe) have been striking in both Syria and Iraq...
Continuing to do the Arabs' job. I don't know if this a good thing or a bad thing at this point 
Another country invading Syrian airspace without even so much as asking? Syria has more than welcomed airstrikes as long as countries ask for bloody access.
Everybody is someone elses terrorist. 
 It's so to strange think while I'm browsing reddit in my nice warm house that is not in a war zone that there are people right now basically living through the apocalypse. The average person in Syria is so fucked. It's not their fault and there is nothing they can do about it. The definition of tragic. 
https://youtu.be/VZZvPlGCt_8

Extremely relevant.
Bombs away! 
Kind of sucks to have the whole world wanting you dead, huh ISIS?


Yes, but who will they be attacking?  What combination of enemies have they chosen?  It's a pick-em!  A veritable buffet of murder!
Great, Great Britain is in the New Crusade!
£800,000 wasted per bomb dropped..
Violence breeds violence. Throwing bombs at the problem won't do anything to solve it.
Do we really need more country to bomb Syria?
Parliament in ignoring public consensus shocker, more at 10.
They're going to bomb the assets and infrastructure of the Syrian government, like the Americans have been doing all along.

This is a war between two forces: one wants to prop up Assad, the other wants him gone. The UK is part of the latter, and their team is currently losing (due to Russia's intervention). That's why the UK had to join (and so did Germany, since they're on the same side); the anti-Assad forces simply need more firepower to counter the advantage that the Russians have created for Assad's government.

This is *not* against ISIS, which none of these governments really care about.
Not good news at all.  :(
Be safe UK armed forces Come home safe. That's all that matters now the talkin is done.
You'd think governments would realise you can't defeat these groups using traditional warfare tactics. 

Didn't defeat the Vietcong, didn't defeat the IRA, didn't defeat the Taliban/ Al Qaeda and they won't defeat Isis with air strikes.


This will most likely be another war we will still fighting in ten years time having achieved nothing.
Exciting news for people living in Syria... people in the UK vote to bomb them. We'll done.
The political repercussions will be far greater than the actually military impact. This contribution is a drop in the ocean.

Well, so long as you call the inevitable 'collateral damage' on innocent civilian lives and the radicalisation of the victims a 'drop in the ocean'.
This world is so fucked.

Yes ISIS is evil.

No this won't solve a thing AND it will kill thousands of innocents  
Jesus. I fucking hate our government. If it was a vote by the common people we would never allow this. Barbaric. My thoughts are with all Syrians tonight. 
Pros: British technology 'could' lower civilian casualties, and could aid those on the frontline who are fighting this war for us.

Cons: Fear wins, people are so afraid of terrorist attacks that they are willing to bomb other innocent people because the delusion that 'attacking them will stop terrorist attacks' exists. 

I wonder if people would feel the same way regarding this decision if the media actually publicised the thousands upon thousands of innocents that have lost their lives in Syria - not just because of collateral damage, but directly by ISIS.

Decisions like this just perpetuate the idea that Western lives matter more. 
Very bad decision. Reminiscent of Iraq bombing.
Christ I despise the Tories. 
Syria is becoming like a real life free to play MMORPG.
Can't help but feel like this is just going to make us a bigger target for ISIS terrorist attacks.
How is this not ww3?
Can you imagine if a given parliament voted in favor of bombing your state?

"French parliament vote in favor of airstrikes in New York."

"Chinese parliament vote in favor of airstrikes in North Carolina."

"Russian parliament vote in favor of airstrikes in Oregon."

We are all so fucking the same, and helpless in this world. The whole fucking place is run by mad people. 
Yet another tax quid that will go towards something I definitely do not want. Obligatory fuck this, fuck that. Horrid stuff. We're not all some kind of evil Avengers ~~~~here  in the UK.
Good News
Literally every single move any politician has made (with the exception of hollande doubling down on his commitment to syrian refugees) since the paris attacks have exacerbated the issue they claim to want to mitigate.

The increased military activity by the west will simply destroy infrastructure, homes, and lives of innocent people who already had enough reason to join ISIS.  Now, they will be much more motivated to do so.  This is exactly how ISIS wants the west to react.

If every penny that has gone to bombing the middle east to shreds would have gone to rebuilding it, there wouldn't be any issues with terrorism.

It is clear that the west deserves what is happening, because they know that they are destroying lives out of hate and revenge under the guise of justice and quelling extremism.  But anyone can see if they actually wanted to do so, they would take a humanitarian instead of military approach.  

They simply want the blood of muslims.  And to argue otherwise is to play devil's advocate.
Cool, Cut Welfare for the poorest cunts in the country, Privatise the NHS on the sly as long as your buddies who own the companies that take up the slack get the contracts. Because of course we have a massive Deficit (That has increased steadily since Tories have been in power.) But on top of all of that lets drop a bunch of bombs that cost 20K each onto Syria to stop ISIS... But really what we will we be doing?

Not even counting the general Intelligence Fuck ups that lead to the killing of a bunch of poor cunts who don't want anything to do with any of this shit in the first place and want to live like they did in Damascus et al, the rest of modern Syria like when it was an Islamic country but socially secular, kinda like Iraq before we fucked it.

Will we achieve anything... the enemy we are fighting are not a cohesive force. They actively manipulate any source of intelligence to cause civilian casualties in their own "State" so that we are the bad guys. ‪#‎bombing‬.

They want a fight and as much as I and the majority of people of sound moral standing I know want to give it to them, their is the overblown and obvious fact that it is like giving a a 3 year old attention whilst s/he is having a tantrum.

If We attack we will be creating exactly what these fucking barbarian fuckwitts want. They are a Fascist Death Cult.

And we are giving them yet more reason to vilify the west in the guise of protecting our own security, our "relatively" stable civilisation, tolerant of all and based on merit (Mostly, it is not fucking perfect but it's one of the best on the god damn planet.... PLANET! [‪#‎PLANET‬] and anyone who says otherwise is an ill-informed, halfwit with the cognitive ability of a child who cant tell the difference between emotions and rational thought.

Bombing this country creates a recruitment drive based on hard facts and evidence in it's rawest form (Their dead children!). It turns not only the borderline extremists in Syria, Not to mentioned the Disillusioned farmers who for the past 3 years have found a better living, simply monetarily holding an AK than growing food for his Family/Nation.

The answer. for whatever Geopolitical reason the west wants Assad gone.

To go mental on the mad conspiracy train, maybe it is the "quid pro quo" to keep the Saudi's onside.

But potentially young disillusioned members of that society and other neighbouring Islamic countries (I personally hate to use that term and I hope my friends and brothers forgive me) but also the UK's 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation families of Islamic decent have who culturally have corresponding nationalities and have been with us since they stood beside us during the First world war and then again in the Second against the tyrant who I will not name as it is gives too much credence to a modern and misguided political environment.

I have no doubt this is the absolute minority. And I speak this from my own personal experience. But until we stand together and stop indiscriminately slaughtering one another there will be no end to the violence on either side.

Their is an insidious darkness within every religion. Whether it be 9/11esque Islamic extremism (Wahhabism), so easily vilified in the west. Saffron terror as Hindu Extremism, the violent Buddhist extremism in Thailand, and the Christian extremism evident THIS week

None of it matters. I am not an atheist, Though I do not believe in organised religion. Any man on this earth who tells you what god thinks about a subject is only telling the truth if he doest ask for money afterwords.

I believe anyone on this planet claiming to know what the most powerful being in the universe thinks is a fucking dirty little fibber and that most people know he is, Including most of their own followers. A lot of people attribute heinous acts to religions, including the people who perpetrate them.

Though that is almost certainly true. Every ounce of evil committed in the name of a Religion. I think there is 100 people doing good for the same Reason.

Singing off

A cunt that has drank too much!
And they say Scotland does not have renewable energy.

Fuck our government. 

I'm disgusted that the tax money I paid is funding this terrorism.
I am absolutely disgusted with this. The current government is a disgrace and could not be so far afield of what the political landscape of Scotland is.  How can we even begin to comprehend the fact that a room full of people literally just sat and voted on whether or not innocent men, women and children should die. Killing innocent people because innocent people were killed is not the answer. Your deeds would shame all the devils in hell. 

Edit: Spelling (angry rant typo)
There's always money for bombs,  never for aid. :(
I'm so fucking sick of these war mongering cunts. 
Good job UK.
Cameron has done a Blair
And history repeats itself again...all those poor civilians.  I'm ashamed to be British.
57 out of 59 of the Scottish MPs who represent Scotland in the Houses of Parliament voted against bombing Syria.  The suits down in London disagreed though, so now we're bombing Syria. Democracy!
As a member of the British public, I feel as if I need to apologise to the innocent Syrian civilians who are going to be plagued by *even more* warfare because a group of middle aged men in suits decided to commence airstrikes... And even *laughed about it*.

No matter if you're for or against more British military action in Syria, you have to see that airstrikes are not the best way forward.
Not a decision to be undertaken lightly, I hope we don't receive information about civilian casualties in the weeks to follow.
Yay, time to kill more innocent people. /sarcasm
No way.... UK in favor of Airstrikes.... this is a game changer and will totally solve all conflict, been waiting for them to get on board......
At least it's something as opposed to nothing. Sitting around with our thumb up our bum isn't going to make ISIS go away, you know.
Its worked every other time!
Those who voted no will have something strong to run on in 5 years
so dumb. . sept 11.. paris style.  now they are gonna abuse the power. and make money off the crisis 
Step 1: bomb Syria
Step 2: ?
Step 3: profit
Hey, they get to contribute in containing ISIL and they get some real-life experience in deploying their military. Seems like a win-win so far. 
Good luck. You can bomb a country, but you can't bomb an ideology.
We are literally going to have to queue up to bomb something that's been bombed to fuck and long abandoned, it's tragically hilarious.
Gotta play the game I suppose.
Mark my words, Syria is the first in a new "war playground" where world powers can fight each other without any civilian casualties (of their own)
but Syria is empty, they're all in Germany now
Can someone ELI5 to me about this please? I don't understand where the money to fund this comes from when we have to cut the public sectors funding
Well fuck
History repeates itself and noone learns a thing.
They have a role to help their allies, terrorism should not be tolerated anywhere at all. Questionably what is the cost and what is the result? What are they achieving, what has been achieved?

Seemingly the same game is being played as it always was at the start of this conflict? But call it stability instead, in it becoming an absolute mess? Where maybe people should pause thinking about what they are really adding and why?

I just don't see how adding more airstrikes is helping anything there? Why couldn't they just let the many others already continue destruction? For once offering the world a peaceful resolution. The Swiss do it fine, the Swedish do it fine, the Japanese do it fine and so many others. What now Germany is back in war? If around 65 countries have been bombing, or have been involved in this conflict, but in that single country those threats haven't been obliterated already, something hasn't been done right, because it seems to be like a mythical Hydra? Just how many bombs does it take? 

If a decision had been called for stablising Iraq go on right ahead, because it remains unstable, and that country was already a former war? 

Syria is a different conflict, where is has already become destablised, causing certain actions that have continued for so much time with no real resolve into ending that war. By adding airstrikes in trying to create peaceful stability after 5 years of war, so by dropping bombs it must make it suddenly more stable? Until everybody has to get involved, and so the bombing continues? Until this is the same war under a different name, but what is causing any crisis?
[The Shadow Foreign Secretary made a fantastic, rousing speech, on the side for military action in Syria.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tgeswg85ak) It almost swayed me into the for camp. Probably is going to go down as one of the best speeches since this century.

Imagine Benn as Labour Leader. His oration skills against Cameron.. Cameron wouldn't stand a chance. 
When the speaker smirked at something immediately after confirming that we are about to drop bombs that will indirectly kill innocent civilians I felt sick to my stomach. 
Yay! More bombs!
This will accomplish nothing. The only thing that may possibly come of this is a new job opening for the next Isis leader. 
We've air bombed the shot out of the entire country.  Just drop a nuke.  17 countries and a lot of different agendas sounds like it's going to have some accidents soon.
WW3 began a few months ago.
Because a few more hundred bombs among the tens of thousands already dropped will obviously do the trick.
good, blast then a new asshole.
Yea, there is no way this is going to go wrong.
"UK openly ask ISIS to attack the United Kingdom"
Not in my name. 

There is an overwhelming sense of unease among many people regarding this decision. 
The biggest problem with bombing is it gives Syrian children of today the reason/want/desire to attack back 10-20 years from now.

The assholes that bomb now might get killed in airstrikes but then the survivors just get more motivation to follow their ancestors. 

We have to tackle terrorism with information, education and love. Also we have to convince the muslim population to follow in the footsteps of christians and to stop taking their book so literally.
This is an international crime, I tuned in and listened to the lunacy playing out. The west has invited themselves into Syria despite the wishes of the democratically elected government of a sovereign state. It's madness.
To all the people talking about London being bombed as a result of this, they'll attack us even if we don't bomb Syria. Don't let their supposed 'retaliation' scare you. These animals don't want us dead because we're bombing them, they want us dead because we're breathing, period. Even if we knelt down to them and begged them for forgiveness they'd slaughter us. 
Can someone explain to me why this isn't history repeating the Iraq War? I might be naive, and if I am then do correct me, but the comparisons at this point between the escalating Syrian invasion and the aforementioned conflict are becoming increasingly prevalent. 
Good, bomb the fuck out of them.
What a sad time we live in where being pro-peace is being called "sympathizing with terrorists". 
[deleted]
It won't change alot, but I think it's important for deash to lose control of major cities and towns and continue indoctrinating hundreds of thousands of minors into jihadism. A future army built from a kind of Hitler youth that is being created would be a far more dangerous monster to deal with in the future, and driving them back into their extremist secret cells with airpower (and hopefully some sort of alliance with moderate ground forces in conjunction with a post-isis plan with Russia) could be considered a victory.  
On a diplomatic point, it shows our support to our allies. But we definitely need to start an embargo on the KSA, otherwise we are just fighting ourselves. 
I honestly feel that our air strike contribution will be minimal in the grand scheme of the coalition. And more importantly any strikes we do would have been done by another coalition member in our place regardless, so all we are doing at this point is agreeing to shoulder a bit of the cost and blame of these air strikes, which honesty doesn't seem too wrong in my opinion. We are all in this together with the rest of the western world, and refusing to help our allies would definitely not make us less of a target to Isis, probably the opposite in fact.
Could someone let me know when the full debate is avaliable on YouTube or Parliament TV? 
If Britain get attacked before their referendum on leaving the EU, they will 100% abandon ship.
For fuck sake man.
2 RAF tornados already in the air syria bound according to Sky news defence correspondent Alistair Bunkall's twitter.
Which part? The rebellion or the current government force? The part that the Russian is bombing or the one Russian is not.
he's an evangelist isn't he?
I'm not casting my vote for either side, but it'll be interesting to see the ratio of terrorist to civilian deaths after this.
Are we formally at war? How can we just invade their sovereignty? 
*sigh...*
If ISIS getting off of Twitter means governments can no longer monitor their communications, then the NSA really sucks at their job.
I think the girls who tricked isis into sending them $3000 are cooler http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/11775228/Three-Chechen-girls-catfished-isis.-Now-theyre-internet-heroes.html
Serious question, but what if the government intelligence agencies left these online assets alone on purpose? In order to gather info or whatever? I mean, surely they have the capability and resources (not to mention administrative powers) to shut down all those ISIS assets if they wanted to, but elected not to?
Can anyone tell me what the actual "messaging forum" was that was taken down? I've read a lot of material on this story and no one seems to know what that target was.

I'm glad Anonymous is actually doing something this time. Instead of expelling hot air. Not that I'm actively doing anything. But still, makes me kind of happy.



EDIT: This is getting bigger than I thought it would. Real quickly. A bit too quickly for me to keep up with. Thanks for all the replies! I'm glad I got to start a discussion! :)
So, 2 tin cans and a rope?
On one hand... it seems like that would be somewhat counterproductive on intelligence gathering (not to say it's all that effective, but i really don't know)  On the other hand... what they are doing is essentially being a stone in the shoe... won't stop them, but will slow them down.  i think as long as Anonymous can slow the recruitment down and might actually start limiting channels could help the intelligence communities have some more focus on where to look... but that's all speculation and there's so many levels of nuance that simplistic soundbite answers are poison.
Damn, the only time Telegram, the supposed Whatsapp-killer, makes publicity is when it's used by terrorists to encrypt their data... 
**First**: I like the flavor of anonymous fighting daesh. Why? Because the idea behind anonymous stands for values like anonymity (yes!), equality, freedom, individualism and so forth, which are all deepest western values, and stand in stark contrast to the twisted "values" of dash's ideology.

**Second**: The use of twitter and co for daesh is probably mainly for propaganda and recruitment, so wannabe terrorists can get contact to them. If you take these easy access platforms from their hands, they loose this propaganda tool, and I cannot see how this should be a bad thing.

They would not tweet concrete plans about their next terror attack. They probably make concrete plans via the "dark net" or other means since a long time already.
I say, if you can take a propaganda tool away from them, then yes you should do so. They have enough shit to deal with at the moment, so they will not be happy about having to deal with computer crap in addition to that.
Sure, they are organised, and sadly not stupid. But also their capabilities are limited.

**Thirsd**: The argument, that the government would take down all these accounts if it would think it would be useful is not a good one I think. If we should have learned one thing from all the terror attacks in the last decades, then, that our governments are actually NOT always one step ahead of the terrorists.
And see, groups like anonymous already hacked into the pentagon systems before. Its not like hacker groups are necessarily worse in what they are doing than government experts.
Here I was thinking the fundamentals of spying were pretty logic and easy to understand. Seeing the massive amounts of ignorance spewed made me doubt that.

Reddit, just... just how are you gonna spy on an enemy if you go up to them and punch them in the face? Ponder on that for a minute and then ask yourself again why it seems like the spy agencies are doing nothing.
Is it at all possible that governments are posing as anonymous to do things without fear of retaliation?
When a govt. Shuts down a torrent site or similar, the common response is multiple other sites will be created or existing sites will accept new users to fill the space left behind by the downed site. The idea is that the pirate community only grows stronger in response to shutdowns. Attacks on the community are studied and  security measures  are adapted or created for protection of the site and users.  

The people responsible for thwarting piracy are viewed as fools playing a winless game of wack-a-mole and I don't see how this logic doesn't apply to anonymous/ISIS as well.
I'm not sure how I feel about non-state actors intervening and possibly interfering with the work of the world's intelligence agencies.

Sure it feels good to irritate ISIS but perhaps there's a reason those accounts were left alone.

For all the shit we talk about the NSA and intelligence agencies as a whole, abuses of power aside, they still play an important role in monitoring dangerous groups. 

This virtual vigilantism may be detrimental in the long run.
I'd contribute to Anonymous if I had these kind of computer skills. Well, I'll cheer for them. I don't know how successful they're gonna be, but at least I'll commend them for doing something different than the kind of wars we've been losing (although we won many fights, whatever that means in the grand scheme of things) decades after decades in the Middle East. &lt;3 Anonymous, thanks for everything !
Will some tech savvy sort explain whether pushing ISIS onto the darknet will or will not NOT lessen their reach? Because the answer doesn't seem straightforward. And, so far, the comments here seem to be made by people who are only guessing, or not considering all the ins and outs.

The darknet is harder to access. Is it or is it not the case that the number of people able to access the darknet are fewer in number than those able to access the public internet? 

If ISIS is presently cultivating relationships with a bunch of newbies, won't that process be cut short by Anonymous's activity?

Also, wouldn't pushing ISIS onto the darknet ultimately make them easier to find and control, since it seems that the darknet is a smaller place? Or at least I assume that it is.

If the NSA has perfected the art of monitoring Facebook and Twitter accounts, can't it also perfect the art of monitoring darknet accounts if it wanted to? If Anonymous can go after accounts on the main, public internet, can't they also go after accounts on the darknet? I think it's probably a naive assumption that intelligence agencies aren't monitoring the darknet. Or, if they are not, might it be that they just don't have the money and manpower to do it effectively.

I think you also need to make a distinction between spying on ISIS and interdicting it. Both surveillance and interdiction seem to be legitimate activities. And now that we actually do seem to be openly at war with ISIS, might not interdiction be a reasonable escalation? Neither surveillance nor interdiction is going to get the job done, but don't you have to do both anyway? Isn't it standard operating procedure to use both tools against an active enemy?

It's obviously true that ISIS can, one way or another, replace the sites and accounts shut down by Anonymous. However, aren't people underestimating what a pain in the ass it is to replace these accounts? Or how inconvenient it is to replace an established internet identity of any kind?

Consider how difficult it is to change your main email address or your cell number. Sure you an do it, but it really is a pain, even with specialized apps. And in the process you can't help but lose touch with some people. Some ISIS agents in the field will doubtless find themselves high and dry.

Assuming that ISIS can and will find workarounds, can we just assume that it won't hurt their operations on some level, to some extent to force them to find workarounds? And will the workarounds be as good as the methods being replaced? I have never found workarounds to be as useful or reliable as the methods they are intended to replace.




Maybe we could get the infamous Lizard Squad to help out too....
If it's common knowledge that it's their main forum then it certainly can't be. I hate isis as much as the next guy but they seem to be pretty tech savvy.
[in This Thread](http://i.imgur.com/og3IHLN.jpg)
how the fuck was it up in the first place? 
Reminds me of the Boston Marathon bombers. The FBI had their suspects identified on video, but they weren't announcing it to the public because they knew the brothers would pick up and run once their face was all over the news. However, all of Reddit all of the sudden became CSI investigators and started posting pictures and videos of potential suspects in crowds from the marathon which was making targets out of a lot of innocent people, so the FBI was forced to release pictures of the suspects prematurely before they could narrow in on them a bit more. Not a single Reddit user identified the correct people either by the way. Fuck off and let the professionals do their jobs.
I can't be the only one who realizes that all this is doing is disrupting ongoing operations by intelligence agencies.

I mean, come on, the people who brought us Stuxnet can certainly take down a forum or a Twitter account if they want to. If those things stay up, it's because the agencies *wanted* them to stay up.
This is fucking stupid. Sitting on these forums is the easiest way to gather intel; why do you think the world governments haven't shut them down already? Because it was a hotbed of chatter that they could watch. 

Stupid fucking anonymous always paving their way to hell with good intentions
ROCK N ROLL

"Hacker on CIA payroll does dirty work"
Reddit is obviously still up.
i bet isis will be terrified when pizza starts showing up to their houses and their psn goes down.
Plot twist.

It was 4chan.
They are probably wrecking all the honeypots setup by the NSA. 
There is a solid reason why Allies did not let anyone know they broke Enigma cipher in ww2. Intelligence gathering.

And Anonymous just destroyed valid information source which will be put alive somewhere else on net in few days. Good intentions, bad decision.
I'm sure the NSA is loving Anonymous' "help." Now they have to work twice as hard to find their dispersed means of communication.
They will make a movie about anonymous one day. It will be full of inaccuracies and cringe but will produce thousands of memes.
"If you don't hear from the boss every two weeks start the event"  
Can somebody explain the differences between NATO or US hacking abilities/intentions and Anonymous?
If anonymous can do this than why isn't the military or CIA? They have to have the capabilities to do so.
&gt; According to some analysts, these attacks launched by Anonymous could be doing more bad than good, as ISIS will be forced to use other platforms, which will then make it difficult for authorities to track down the terrorists.  
  
That logic escapes me. They clearly can't hide, and them having to find new places makes it harder on them.
Better than ordering a bunch of pizzas to some random person. Good job Anon. 

Yes yes. Make it harder for agencies to find them. 
Good job！
Attack by FBI/CIA on Anonymous incoming; they won't openly say they're responsible, though.
If Anonymous doxed all of the sympathizers who expressed outrage that would go a long way. 
Down side. It drives them deeper into a communication hole. Making it difficult to communicate the smallest idea.
Harder to find.


Up side. It drives them deeper into a communication hole. Making it difficult to recruit the smallest mind.
Harder to join.


Good job anonymous. 
The entire west should just start applying to Isis, bombarding them with applications that they would never be able to keep up with.  Ask for money for travel but never go.
I am curious to know Anonymous going to do with the communication performed on the Tor network. I am sure they would be using it by now. Taking Twitter accounts down is really low level stuff. 
I know a lot of people have been making the point that anonymous is taking down a great deal of intelligence we can access from them, but at the same time this may be their main medium of communication.
If they remove their ability to quickly communicate with very distant partners they have potentially prolonged the planned attacks and gained the information that was planned. 
It seems reasonable that if we just shut down the forums, they will more quickly become disorganized without expected communication channels.  That is unless of course they have fully written and executable disaster recovery plans.
Finally, we can get on with our lives!
Keep it up...follow the rabbit hole.
It may have something to do it effectively.
If Anonymous can go after accounts on the CIA's part - just a completely sticky situation and I remember some person being brought up as a possible spy, they would just take that shit down.
Why would they do that? That means they will find new ways of planning their terrorism and it might make the job harder for the intelligence agencies.
How do you know it's the main? 
They took down Puffin Pals! Oh no!
Isis use Facebook messaging and plenty of other platforms,
So this is not exactly a major victory.... Check the WSJ report. 
Chances are the US and various govt's were using this forum for counter Intel--this isn't exactly a win, it is a source destroyed. 
The message board was almost certainly being monitored by many intelligence agencies.  Anonymous probably just made their job harder.

Anonymous is like PETA - their main accomplishment is always drawing attention to themselves.
Why does it take anonymous to do this. couldn't a major government have been able to do this years ago?
Wow, what a badass using DDoS
So the lesson seems to be here, that although finesse has a part to play, in hitting the flow of recruits to ISIS anonymous seems to be achieving more by crowdsourced, low skilled "attacks".
Um....so, uh, how are we planning to track ISIS online now ?
Just checked habbo hotel, it's still up.

And there goes all that good Intel?
This seams like shutting down a source of information and source of reader identification. 
Wouldn't it be better to monitor the forum to see what they are up to? They're just going to build another forum. 
Anonymous is doing more to combat ISIS than most countries are. Good for them.
what a bunch of morons. I think they should stop intervening with police works. that forum was most probably tapped already. fuck all those pimpled script kiddies
About time Anonymous should be appreciated
Clearly they're effective combating cyber ISIS, things our Government couldn't accomplish
Was it 4chan? I'll bet it was 4chan.
Would that be CNN or Fox?
Damn, MySpace was still trying to come back though
its like Edward Snow
den unplugged

How they do take down Twitter accounts?  What does it mean?
They should get access to everything. Go NSA status on everyone and make sure you're aware of keywords and connections within people. Catch any hidden ISIS member within the U.S. or anywhere. Link all that info to local police. Now that's an operation.
Great.

Because what good was an online communications system that we knew about, and which could be used to harvest intelligence about the locations and activities and viewpoints of ISIS terrorists?

Good job, guys.
Anonymous are heroes of the Republic. 
Is Anonymous fuckng retarded?
I guarantee that the US and other government intellignce networks have been reading that shit. 
Now that those cocksuckers took it down, ISIs will only find a more secure and hidden place to message.  
Sometimes it's best to wait until the time is right. 
Anon knows nothing of the overall strategy. 
Where do those dumbasses think we get the intellignce to bomb ISIS's asses from? 
Those God dang retards! 
oh noes ISIS subreddit is no longer functioning :(
Making it harder for intelligence agencies to track terrorists. Great work you fucking basement dwelling losers. 
[deleted]
Seems like this may be damaging the war effort. Isis moving over to Tor? 
"Rachel Bryson ... it will not affect the spread of Jihadist propaganda in the long run. She added that even if Anonymous becomes successful in paralyzing all of ISIS' systems, the terrorist group will still find a way to rebuild them."

Rachel Bryson does not understand how effective social media is as a tool. 
Anonymous is overrated. 
They're like the avengers but covered in taco bell wrappers 
Good, now take down their porn and we're good.
Has no one else noticed the article doesn't even mention what the main forum was, where it was, etc. ?
I would just post the link to 4Chan and grab some popcorn 
Thanks Anonymous! Keep doing what you're doing 
Twitter is down again?
They took down Xbox Live!?!
About time.
And what if those message forums was the best source for government information regarding their activities? 
What if ISIS is Anonymous? Anyone thought of that? Hear me out... What if ISIS members are pretending to be Anonymous and using this situation to spread red herrings, cover tracks etc. 
Why didn't they do this before?  Why wait until they've killed over 100 Europeans?
I never understood this type of tactic. You find the medium they communicate with, and instead of watching it and finding out useful information, you shut it down completely, making any intelligence gathering impossible, and yea it may stop them communicating and carrying out missions for a very short while, but this just forces them further underground and potentially more dangerous. Very foolish if you ask me. We need to think about the long game, cause they are without a doubt, instead of just trying to get a small win in the short game. 
CIA probably monitors the forum for Intel. It's like working hard to find and bugging the place then Anonymous comes siren blaring and raids the place making it unusable. Now ISIS gotta find a new forum and the CIA gotta find it and start all over again. Not sure if this tactic is productive. 
Anonymous should focus on western armies and governments who kill way more civilians than any Muslim terrorists do. 
If anonymous is objective they should fight all evil in the world equally.  
Save lives with your information, don't pick a side. 
I'm worried by destroying their infiltrated comm network, we now lose tons of intelligence as they move to Tor.

Not sure this is a good idea at all.

so why do you spend billions on cybersecurity if a bunch of script kiddies into CP are doing your job for you?  makes you look like you aren't even trying .. what a scam.
I think this is a mistake, I worry we lose a lot of intelligence by taking such a thing down, rather than simply infiltrating it. They may accidentally do more harm than good
They took down the PlayStation Network???
Honestly this might be worse than doing nothing- what if the messaging forum was one source of intelligence on ISIL?

Although I'm sure are existing SIGINT routes to sniff out traffic in Raqqa and Mosul...
&gt; According to some analysts, these attacks launched by Anonymous could be doing more bad than good, as ISIS will be forced to use other platforms, which will then make it difficult for authorities to track down the terrorists. ISIS has reportedly moved the majority of its operations towards the dark web, which is only accessible with special computer programs like Tor Browser. “We keep seeing them migrating across different platforms,” according to Bryson. “I don’t think by shutting down a current means of communication will mean the Islamic State fails. It’s not key to defeating them.”
[deleted]
Hehe, stupid 4chain virgins, xDDD what do they think they will do? Post shit memes on /ISIS/?
That's fucking stupid, we use that to monitor these fuck ups; you don't want them opting to use Tor next. 
These fucking morons need to stop. They are making it harder for the people who are going to actually do something. You do not want to just fucking cut off your source of information even if it's bad. 
LOL they are such jokes! They're not going to accomplish anything. /s
People, read the article.

&gt;I provided examples based on our data on the financing of different Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) units by **private individuals**.

He's saying there's evidence that **private** individuals from 40 countries, including G20 members, are funding ISIS. Not the governments themselves. 
This is being misinterpreted by most commenters - please read the article!!

 Putin is talking about private individuals financing ISIS, not states. It should be obvious to anyone that ISIS is financed from Islamists residing in many countries - possibly including France, the UK, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, Russia and other nations. It is also obvious that a lot of that money must transit through money-laundering-states like Luxembourg or Switzerland. None of this is real news, although it would be useful if the individuals could be identified.

Now if it could be proven that states (not individuals), e.g. Saudi Arabia or Turkey, are financing ISIS, this would be big news with major geopolitical consequences.
Why on earth doesn't the US do something to curb the funding of ISIS by wealthy citizens of Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey?
&gt;*The motorcade of refueling vehicles stretched for dozens of kilometers, so that from a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters they stretch beyond the horizon.* Putin added, comparing the convoy to gas and oil pipeline systems.

Trucks filled with oil shouldn't be too hard to destroy, sounds like a ripe and easy target.

Never thought I'd say this but I'm really liking Putin right now.  This is the type of straight forward discussion and decision making that the world needs.  

EDIT: For all of those who keep taking this post super seriously and as some sort of general support for Putin, get over yourselves and take a deep breath.  It doesn't matter how you feel about him or even if you think he has ulterior motives.  This post is not meant to be anything more than it is.  Relax.  Go see a movie.

EDIT: For all of the upvoters, thank you.  Glad to see calmer minds can prevail.  
can't wait until the world is less dependent on oil 
Russia is admitting that there's legitimate opposition in Syria in addition to the terrorists? I'm kind of surprised. 
Guess which G20 member is funding ISIS?
http://gfycat.com/ReflectingLargeFurseal
90% of you dont (*seem to) comprehend this but Turkey is more than its current president.
"I’ve shown our colleagues photos taken from space and from aircraft which clearly demonstrate the scale of the illegal trade in oil and petroleum products," he said.

“The motorcade of refueling vehicles stretched for dozens of kilometers, so that from a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters they stretch **beyond the horizon**".
  
^I wonder who they sell that oil to?  
He's right.

- The House of Saud is practically directly funding them.

- Turkey is literally shipping weapons to them, categorically denying it when they were caught doing so, and prosecuting the journalists who openly called them out for it.
Putin is the only one world leader who can reveal information like this without fear and that is what makes him the most powerful man in the world.
Can we change "countries" to private individuals in the title, this is misleading
Turkey funds them.
Cameron looks like he asking to borrow a tenner in the photo.
It's... curious... that Putin has to show Obama/U.S. what ISIS is doing.  We have ample capability to get the same satellite imagery, or UAV images.  Is the U.S. military / intel incompetent, deliberately not bothering, hiding, or is the U.S. government ignoring?  We could spot a terrorist leaving a house in Iraq, but we don't know ISIS is hauling oil in such numbers?  Something is not right.
 
Typical Reddit...has anyone read the article?..most of the comments  on here are talking about a completely different subject ( governments) now  from the article  Putin says:



During the summit, “I provided examples based on our data on the financing of different Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) units by private INDIVIDUALS. This money, as we have established, comes from 40 countries and, there are some of the G20 members among them,” Putin told the journalists.
Lol why did they put in the clip of that guy being awkward in front of the camera
ITT: Redditors thinking they know, even the slightest bit, about international relations and economics.  smh at this thread.
What about the countries that buy the oil from ISIS?
Not surprising, I remember back when ISIS started up as a legimate state, people were giving handouts and requesting donations on the streets(Copenhagen, by the way, yes i lived in a shitty neighborhood).

They're widely accepted by a large minority(not majority, we know) of muslims. Unfortunately there's a LARGE majority who silently enables it. 
God damn Putin is a bad ass.
I hate to agree with Putin, but...
Is everyone also forgetting the enormous black market funneling money to IS to buy antiquities from ravaged archaeological sites? That money is coming from all over the world. IS has been plundering sites in Turkey, Iraq, and Syria for a while now, then turn around and hock it online.
Prescott Bush funded Hitler.  Ask me if he's related to two presidents and one current presidential candidate.
Why would they do that?
People in this thread making up different things from their own deluded perception of the middle east 
As far as I'm aware, about 70% of US equipment is abandoned and basically taken for free by ISIS, that's some meaningful help I guess.
The site says that the US refused to work with Russia.  Putin says the US sent him a communication that says "we reject your offer".  I thought I read in the news that the US agreed to work with them at the G20.
Russia has some great spies,  maybe its time they used them to pay these people a visit.
Saudi Arabia is in G20.  How insightful.  
Investigate the banks and governments through "International Transparency Forensic Accounting" and you find the money source that feeds ISIS. That is the way you cut off the head of the snake.
When you cut off the supply of weapons and food, the ISIS mercenary will go back home. There are certain US government officials that know about the money trail that leads all the way back to the US taxpayer. These dark officials need to be flushed out to expose the lies that are being told by the US government and its Allies. ISIS is a state without a country, no borders and no common language either. It was created by “Big Money” that is supplied by states and banks and corrupt corporations.
This is the "Army of Darkness" and it is going to fight anything that has beauty, light, integrity, freedom, higher thinking. It is going to fight them all. Darkness fights for survival, darkness represents control, absolute control over everything, but mostly over money. Greed and corruption exists in the dark easily. By exposing it all through the internet and bringing it to the light it will not survive and lose the battle. The old energy of "Divide and Conquer" has waged war for a long time in the name of God, Race, Religion and political, economic separation. This enemy must be fought by Governments and Organizations and people that still have integrity, power, guts and compassion to defeat ISIS and its control named Fear.
We are all in this together on this only planet of free choice. The war against this dark force can only be won if we see ourselves as one instead of being divided by race, religion, color or nationality. So when we change our world will change with us.
Remember: Peace is not the end goal, it’s the beginning of a new era in our future.

We should be referring to ISIS as 'Daesh' (داعش).
I bet one of the reasons why he didn't mention which countries are those is that Russia is one of them. Maybe Chechens? Or s1 from the military industry?
I'll try to summarize what I learned *after doing my research* about the war in the middle east.

Religion is one the main factors. It's basically an indirect fight between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and Israel on the side.

Saudi Arabia regime's religion is Wahabi, which is a sect of Sunni Islam, which literally hate Shiite Islam (Iran). Add to it, Saudi Arabia preaches jihad and suicide shit in their mosques. Saudi Arabia wants to stay in power in the Arab world, by having control over Sunni Islam.

Iran is mostly Shiite. Asaad Regime is Alaoui, sect of Shiite Islam, also Asaad and Iran are allies. Hezbollah in Lebanon are Shiite also.

So you get the idea? it's basically a Wahabi vs Shiite fight. Note that, the terrorists, ISIS members are either Wahabi or Sunni indoctrinated by the Saudi Arabia regime.

As of today, mostly in the Arab world, the islamists (not the Sunni in general, just the Wahabi or extremists) hate the Shiites blindly. The conflict goes back to after Mohammed's death, so yeah it's a long story. If you want to know some small and interesting info, this conflict wasn't mainstream until the Shiite got back in power, like in Iran, or powerful like Hezbollah in Lebanon. Even in the 2006 Lebanon-Israel war, Saudi Arabia were hoping Hezbollah gets wiped out and Israel wins the war.

The biggest weapon suppliers for Hezbollah are Iran and Syria, and usually everything passes by Syria. So by taking out Asaad, they made it harder for the others. That's the main reason why Hezbollah was involved in the Syrian fight, to defend his ally. They used the Lebanese borders attacks as excuses to go in the fight. The border attacks are basically pre-ISIS (free Syrian army) attacking the villages on the Lebanese border with rockets, which are mostly populated by Shiites. So when Hezbollah interfered there in Syria, they managed to turn things around for Asaad's regime. After a while, ISIS popped out of nowhere like a cancer, they started chopping heads off and doing insane shit. Take note that, Asaad and Hezbollah directly blamed and are still blaming Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar for funding ISIS, Israel(mainly Mossad) and the US for supporting them, either via weapons or trainings.

You might ask why Israel? 2 countries surrounding Israel are definitely against them, Lebanon and Syria. Hezbollah(considered as a resistance) in Lebanon given that Lebanon army is pretty shit, they can only buy certain types of weapons, sanctions set by USA. They tried taking out Hezbollah before but they failed so far, so they jumped on Syria. Asaad will never make peace with Isarel and that's already assured. Why do you think the US and Israel are anti-Asaad? So by taking down Asaad, they are left with Hezbollah which isn't a big deal, given that Hezbollah is considered a resistance in Lebanon and they don't have enough man/power to attack Israel.

All in All, and that's my opinion. US and Israel are involved in this fight, and they fund ISIS indirectly or at least they support them. wether you like it or not, this whole thing was being planned for years before this started and the soul purpose is to protect the borders of Israel. The arabs fight between each other while ignoring the Palestinian cause and Israel all together. Add to it, Saudi Arabia, if Asaad resigns or dies, will keep it's dominance over the entire Arab world, and the Shiites will become weaker.

I know, this is fucked up, and please before commenting defending the US or Israel, do your research, it's pretty clear that I did mine. The US fucked up in a lot of occasions and sooner or later, these information will become clearer.

Also if I want to blame a person for all these issues? I blame George Bush. Invading Iraq was the main purpose of the rise of the indoctrinated extremist jihadis to this current state, ISIS. Some rich dudes, regimes... saw the Jihad thing in Islam as an opportunity to create the so called extremist mentality.
You know the worlds fucked and completely off its moral compass when a Russian Gangster Dictator is lecturing the rest of the world on camaraderie and togetherness.

All time low.
The best way to fight ISIS, basically, is for leaders to stop thinking about money and start thinking about humanity. We've literally given them the weapons they are now shooting with.
Putin dropping truth-bombs yet again.
You have to ask the right questions.

Who or whom are benefiting from the continuous battles/bombing/turmoil?



*Oil used by the allied forces cost money.


*Bullets, armory, weapons etc cost money.


*Behind the scene finance related industries may benefit by insuring properties near the area from damage etc.


*Developers, with agendas on rebuilding damaged areas affected by war.



*Hedge fund bankers, manipulating the performance of the economy and corporations affected by the turmoil.






Corruption and greed are  strong dominant traits in society.


I wonder who is buying ISIS oil, and why the ISIS controlled oil plants haven't been disabled by airstrikes?

Nice time for a wire reference "If you follow drugs you get drug dealers and drug addicts. If you follow the money you have no idea where it will take you!"

Hence the reason why no one talks about how ISIS finances itself and no one follows the money trail. It would be a crying shame if JP Morgan, Citigroup or some wealthy Saudis was funding them now wouldn't it?
Russians are fucking OGs   

ISIS? Bombed. Next.      
ISIS Again? Ur funding them. stop funding them. Then we bomb them.   
Next    

Any source that's more credible than state-controlled Russia Today?
Can we just clarify that this is a Russian owned news company posting comments made by the president of Russia... Propaganda is a double edged blade...
This is the plot of a video game Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist.
I feel like instead of calling them "Islamic State" which is what they want to be, we should all agree on a more fitting name, like maybe "sh*t eating dog f*ckers."  That would sound better in all the news articles.
ISIS won't be where they are without the Saudis and other rich Arabs.
Post their names publicly and hang them publicly  
&gt; Let's work together to annihilate ISIS.

Amen.
Individuals don't always represent the countries they come from. 
watch how much coverage this gets on mainstream media.. NEXT TO ZERO!
Just make European version of Mossad. Go around killing terrorists and terrorist funders without remorse. Make them shit themselves.
Let's find out these 40 countries.

1. SAUDI ARABIA
conspiracy theory or not, would lockheed martin for example be doing as well financially if wars suddenly stopped happening?  metal gear solid coins this idea "the war economy".  it might just be a game, but you have to admit war is great business for contractors.

now im not saying that there are necessarily large, corporate interests who want this conflict to continue, but I don't think military contractors are losing sleep over new wars being waged.  what good is weapons production with world peace, right?
Plot twist: Toyota is funding them vehicles
&gt; “We really need support from the US, European nations, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran,” the president added.

Why the fuck are we still taking the Saudis seriously?  They funnel more money and support to terrorists than anyone.

Oh right...they're rich and the war on terror was lead by Conservative president for the first 8 years...Thanks, Bush.
Is RT to even be trusted on these matters anymore. They are the russian propaganda machine. 
Russia has a lot of nerve criticizing other countries for "funding" horrible regimes and etc. Aren't they largely responsible for funding many bloodthirsty regimes in southeast asia in the past?

Aren't they somewhat working allies with North Korea? Don't they support the Assad regime (though won't openly admit it.) Aren't they also actively bullying eastern europe right now?

Putin should fuck off with being a hypocrite about this sort of thing.
Kgb, Fbi and Kgb are trying to prove that they are the best at catching criminals.

 Secretary General of the UN decides to give them a test. He releases a rabbit into a forest and each of them has to catch it.

The CIA goes in. They place animal informants throughout the forest. They question all plant and mineral witnesses. After three months of extensive investigations they conclude that rabbits do not exist.

The FBI goes in. After two weeks with no leads they burn the forest, killing everything in it, including the rabbit, and they make no apologies. The rabbit had it coming.

The KGB goes in. They come out two hours later with a badly beaten bear. The bear is screaming: "Okay! Okay! I'm a rabbit! I'm a rabbit!"

You don't mess with the Russians
Is he talking about Russia, who is aiding Assad's army in fight against rebels, instead of ISIS? The same Russa that Helps Assad, who then buys oil from ISIS?

What a dick.
how the fuck are we allowing garbage articles from the kremlin sponsored RT to be the top post of the front page of reddit? 

***cough*** Saudi Arabia ***cough***
One must ask, why the fuck are these guys allowed to line up oil trucks for kilometers without being vaporized?

Reeks of conspiracy.
This is really rich coming from Russia considering Syria is one of the main purchasers of Islamic State oil. They know this, and turn a blind eye.

Why not bomb the oil convoys? The ones that stretch for miles... oh, right, you'd anger your ally, Syria, and lots of other people who are looking to turn a blind eye.
Funny how everyone points fingers as if **we** haven't given funding and support to ISIS in recent memory. Money was flowing into Syria thick and fast when Boogeyman Bashar was *international community* enemy #1.

Everything critics said about Syria and Bashar al-Assad turned out to be true. Just as before that everything said by critics of western foreign policy turned out to be right on Gadaffi and Libya. And before that Iraq. We've been blundering so much since the 90s it's no wonder people jump to conspiracy ideas about illuminati long-cons for Orwellian one-world governments. The alternative is that our intelligence agencies are retarded almost beyond belief which is no less outlandish. I have a hard time believing that some of the smartest and most well resourced organisations in the world are completely oblivious to the concept of blowback. They almost certainly knew that their actions (supporting rebel groups in Syria, Libya) and inactions (looking the other way in the case of Saudi Arabia) would lead to ISIS becoming what it is today. 
 
Also lol at people who recognize RT for being propaganda but have a complete blind spot when it comes to the media in their own countries. If you think RT is *that* bad compared to the media in the States then you are truly brainwashed. They both ship propaganda and blatantly so. If anything western propaganda is more dangerous because we're that much better at it. The Russians are midrange propagandists and it's on the whole easier to spot their outright lies and state apologism. 
*Putin, save us.*

-Sincerely, the world
man, I respect the fuck out of Putin. Is that normal?
RT reporting is shit! Why do people consider it a reliable source!?
Funny how Reddit has no problem with RT when it matches the echo chamber.
Russia does not have nearly the intelligence gathering apparatus to monitor that many countries.  This is merely RT playing its role as the propaganda mouthpiece of the Kremlin.
this will not be reported on by the media

He is one badass politician. 
Sorry guys, when I see an article is from RT my brain automatically tunes it out. RT is for conspiritards and crazy Putin supporters. Also, Putin shares a lot of responsibility for getting ISIS to where it is. ISIS was only able to come to power in Syria because of the chaos that Al Assad caused when he attacked initially peaceful protests and plunged his country into civil war, and he did it all with Putin's political and military support. Putin is only concerned with keeping his crony in power there, and his imperial interests by way of their Syrian military base.
So what? 

The USA *created* ISIS. Gave them all the guns and money they'd need.


This whole thing is hilarious because it's clear that the gulf wars of the past were a facade; drummed up by the Bush's to maintain influence and control. 

But wait, now a group of militants raised under the ignorant and oppressive regime you manufactured, yet publicly condemned, and gave money and guns to, is *doing things outside your control and/or foresight?*

What are the odds?

hashtag whitepeopleproblems
After the Russian government presented photoshopped pictures from Google maps as evidence for Ukrainians shooting down a plane I find every intel presented by Russian government very very suspicious. 
This makes me think Putin is more competent at battling this than Obama at this point. 
[deleted]
If you wanna go tinfoil on that it would be easy to see why some countries did this since it's like a win-win for them. The goverments have an easier time controlling a scared population and push for mass surveilance and restrictions of freedom (which we have seen plenty in the last decade and beyond), they can point to a boogeyman to distract people from other issues, push patriotism to make people go along with it and tax them. The military industrial complex can reap tons of profits from the war going on and there're some goods to be had with some under the table black market deals.

Kind of reminds me of that one conspiracy documentary, though the sad thing is that what I just descriped is what is happening, though the real motivations might be different.

But even if these people in power aren't driven by greed and are indeed benevolent and really want to protect their people and defeat this enemy, even if they're absolutely genuine in their efforts... the path to hell is paved with good intentions, and we're seeing plenty of that.


I really can not understand why we allow this to happen. I have no doubt we know exactly who is doing this and the solution is simple. If someone sends one fucking cent to ISIS the next day a SWAT team busts down the door and puts a bullet in their head. Regardless of where you live, who you are, or what you do you will be hunted down and killed if you fund ISIS.  
I bet Goldman Sachs has its filthy claws somewhere in this. Probably on the backend with illegal oil sales, covering the money trail.
Why is RT allowed to be shared here? It's the propaganda arm of the Russian government that spreads conspiracy theories and lies. 

They had all sorts of "alternative explanations" for the downing of the civilian MH17 plane. They're not credible news. 
Why the hell are we upvoting russian propaganda to the front page? 
"Putin also disagreed with Western criticism of Russia’s actions in Syria, where the country has been carrying out a large-scale air campaign against Islamic State and other terror groups since September 30."

Other terror groups = Syrian rebel forces?

That is my first assumption, being the article is from a state-owned 'news' agency. 


Does this to anyone sound like the 5 Kage Summit where they learn that some of the Kages themselves were funding Akutski and basically allowed them to grow to the menacing force they are today and leaving them no choice but to start the 3rd Ninja War? No? OK... 
US spy satellites have the same images Putin does. If 0bama really wanted to shut ISIS oil trading down it could be done in mere hours. We are being lied to. Endless war is the goal of the US and the international Zionists.
Putin is the based god the world needs.  fuck these spineless leaders like Obama and Merkel.  
Why should we believe ANYTHING Putin says?????????????
ISIS is Western propaganda created by the US government and the CIA for anti-Arab and anti-Russian interests.

This journalist on RT speaks the truth: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7GAbVhjTSw#t=145

So what's the solution? 
We need an energy Manhattan project like yesterday... Let's stop sending money to the people who want us dead.
In 20 years oil won't be that big a player... then we can go to war with Saudi Arabia :)
Uveal
Just do what Tennessee does and have cops take all the money they can find because "drugs are bad, mkay?"
I didn't expect coming out like this! :-)
I heard on NPR today that ISIS pays their soldiers $700 a month! How are we supposed to fight against that? I can't imagine there are it of jobs to be had -and very few paying that much. 

I also heard in the same story that they are running schools only teaching about jihad &amp; showing young children beheading videos. 
war is good business and business is good.
Is there a list of these 40 countries?
I think the real question that needs to be asked is, who are these individuals? Who would benefit from financing ISIS?
ELI5??
&gt; "I’ve shown our colleagues photos taken from space and from aircraft which clearly demonstrate the scale of the illegal trade in oil and petroleum products," he said.

I'm sure that once this gets investigated and the "buyers" are named it will be a list of names as interesting as the oil for food program in Iraq was. Numerous countries and companies were involved in paying Saddam Hussein kick backs for preferential oil contracts in Iraq. Including some UN officials who were overseeing the program. 


One of the primary beneficiaries during the program was Russia.

So America funds Terrorists that it is trying to kill?
So we find them, and we SIEZE THEIR SHIT.
It is a purely political statement. He is just trying to become a hero and to show that western allies are doing damage to people by not supporting him.

Intelligence agencies must be sharing this kind of information already. But Obama or Hollande or anyone else never blamed other nations by holding a special press conference.
Russia is happy to be involved to stop the cheap oil trade.
Is that the same Putin whose plants are bombing the Kurds and other enemies of ISIS? So that the West will have to choose between ISIS and Putns Assad?
Almost considered anarchy. Thanks for the flair.

Why would G20 countries do such a harmful thing? Finance the modern time KKK?
There is nothing simple about ISIS

It is not officially supported by any Arab government, yet it appears that it is supported by many Arabs, some who work in government

It's a complex story, and I wish we knew more of it

Who exactly supports it? What are their strategic goals?

Why do they do whatever they can to fan the flames of war?


This can't be good...
Now that the Liberals are in power, Canada has considerable resources they can allocate from other defense resources toward this kind of means of investigation.
Maybe it's time to announce war on terrorism against Russia. Maybe throw in some chemical weapons aswell.
Politics are weird in the middle east. America supports rebels against Assad but Al Qaeda is fighting against Assad in Syria. Putin is supporting Assad against Al Qaeda. The Kurds are fighting all of those except some militias. The Turks don't want Kurdish autonomy so the US can't support them. ISIS is fighting everyone. Jesus..
Does anyone else notice the photo in this article of Putin &amp; Obama chatting is the exact photo taken by our beloved, "weird man at G20". Haha full circle. 
Going after these financiers, perhaps lethally, may be an idea to consider.
MMM...smell that executive immunity.  Smells like dead people.  Pungent.  
What would really be interesting is if Putin starts putting the pressure on the US to go after saudi arabia.  Everyone knows they're a state sponsor of terror.  Putin has nothing to use by turning the entire world against the US for not taking action against them.
No shit, this is exactly how the NSDAP became so powerful. You think autobahns just build themselves? fuck no, it takes money, alot of money.
Ah right.

I hadn't got the whole fossil fuel economy control angle before explaining Russia's keenness in eliminating ISIS. That would explain a lot. 
Money is power, not the government!!
They're probably one of the richest fund-raising organizations in the world.
Hearing Cameron speak is just the funniest, i want to see that full meeting he and Putin had, blatantly lies through his teeth, it reminds me of Nixon, Kennedy debate.
And we keep the money in Russian banks.
So, even if it is funded by private sources, why would somebody fund them and what advantage would they get by doing that?
If it's RT or not, Putin calls a spade a spade, despite western politicians.

Just take a look at the Obama/Erdogan meeting today @ G20. Erdogan talking  about fighting terrorism, are u fucking kidding me? This guy is tolerating ISIS next door all the way and watches them slaughter Kurds in Kobane eating popcorn. Our western leaders are full of shit and lie when they open their mouths. Turkey is buying ISIS oil and lets weapons and fighters enter Syria since day one.  Not to mention the crackdown on free press and opposition media inside Turkey. 

Cowards, all of them. 
Are we just going to forget that Russia hasn't really been attacking ISIS? The vast majority of their targets have been rebel groups that are direct threats to Assad.
forgot to add who give it 3 cents to create it :)
Yeah we know.  But everytime we try to investigate someone we get called racists.  How do you know someone who says he is sending money to his parents to buy a house in Iran is really doing that and not a front?  You cant without infriging upon privacy of some kind.
I wonder if any of them are Russian.
Not "by", "from".
&gt; “Apparently, their opinion of us is based on their own concept of human decency,” he added.

Twitter twats are smalltime compared to you guys. Keep it up
And on the same day Obama bombed the trucks used to transport the illicit fuel. Had Putin not said this, would Obama have allowed this pipeline-on-wheels to continue making IS a million dollars a day on oil sales?
It's the Kabal in real life!
This must be tackled by the government but most are probably just exchanges them right away to his local currency so that from a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters they stretch beyond the horizon.
We already know there is one particular country not far from ISIL, ruling over Anatolian peninsula, that may or may not be covertly supporting them.
Lol why did they put in the clip of that guy being awkward in front of the camera
maybe we should start our own terrorist group to terrorize isis.
EEUU its one of them and the hates will come but its true people, search a little in google, behind everything EEUU creates the ISIS/ISIL 
Why would we turn down teaming up with Russia to take out terrorists?
Why hasn't reddit removed this yet?
Well  

    putin   

 says it and  

    RT  

  confirms it so...WORD
Terrorism ?
Only money or power works in the real world.
Probably just happens to be supporters who have made bank accounts in foreign countries, because who would leave a large sum of money in the hands of an unstable country.
Most of fucking middle east wars were funding by the west. Why is this surprising?
Saudi Arabia needs more freedom. Let's liberate it from the oppressors. 
Let's see the list!!
Putin's words are for his people, not for the international community. In Russia, it is common to blame/link western influences for the world's issues and problems. The Russian immigrants I know have told me about how most Russians buy into this propaganda and it is an eye opener to see other media when travelling abroad.
I like how Anonymous and Wikileaks are being good boys and not exposing the financiers of ISIS. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UAeSsvHhTg

Why the fuck is RT allowed on here.
RT as a source...not reading that. Even if this is a fact based article, they are known for their lies.
Honestly, Putin is correct.
Putin, when will you finally use the legendary quote "You're either with us, or you are with the terrorists!"
Many major Western dailies have determined that their comment sections are being regularly inundated by Russian internet trolling operations.  Reddit needs to wisen up and recognized when they are being used.
If you don't know that the U.S played a part in funding ISIS then I am not sure what will open your eyes.
Well someone is funding them
World is so messed up right now. 
"We need to organize work specifically concentrated on the prevention of terrorist attacks and tackling terrorism on a global scale. We offered to cooperate [with the US] in anti-IS efforts. Unfortunately, our American partners refused. They just sent a written note and it says: ‘we reject your offer’,” Putin said.
He's taking so many political points right now. He must be absolutely loving it.
I would make fun of Russia for clearly only caring because their oil industry and economy is suffering, but ain't like Europe or the US is any different.
I haven't the faintest notion as to why the EU prefers to have better relations with the Islamo-fascistic absolute monarchy of SA than with the free, European, almost-democratic Russian Federation. Is it simply a love affair with hardline traditionalism for the spoiled, affluent European liberals? Do they believe that Islam is better than the cultural anarchy that has taken hold all across Western Europe? Or is it simply a cold, ruthless economic partnership? "We'll let you execute gay people and apostates as long as you sell us oil for 50 cents cheaper than Russia offers".
I like how he criticizes the US for not wanting to give information about groups, fearing that Russia will attack the ones the US supports by saying we don't trust them, then Putin immediately continues the lie about not knowing if their aircraft was bombed by ISIS. Just wow. Talk about being completely tone deaf to the situation. And the Putin Bots will defend this bullshit, of course.
From the news source that brought you gems such as "The Moon doesn't exist, NASA made it up"
In before Reddit nukes this front page post. Just saying. 
Another conspiracy theory proved true. 
The difference is that Russia has an interest to actually destroy ISIS, an almost entirely selfish interest, but a legitimate one. The west has shown absolutely no interest at all in attempting to stop ISIS. 

Ever since the Arab spring, the clear focus from the west has been to try eliminate secular Arab leaders and replace them with radical jihadists regimes. Any attempt at a peaceful democratically elected government is shut down if it is not under western control. 
Not much of a surprise given you have Saudi Arabia and Turkey in the G20. 
But Mostly individuals from USA, KSA and Israel.
RT isn't news. It's Russia's PR agency.
Putin dropping truth-bombs yet again.
&gt; “The motorcade of refueling vehicles stretched for dozens of kilometers, so that from a height of 4,000 to 5,000 meters they stretch beyond the horizon," Putin added, comparing the convoy to gas and oil pipeline systems.

What countries are buying this oil and why Syrian and intervention forces are not bombing those oil fields to negate ISIS access to those resources? This is a no brainer...
I wonder how many of those countries are raising the French flag right now. Fucking crocodile tears 
Countries like russia should have more control with money through Banks to mafia and terror organisations..  And all the other dangerous people..  Probably goes for turkey and italy too.. 
Well if Putin is saying it, then it must be true. 
Who would have known, russia is the good guy.
Apparently, their opinion of us is based on their own concept of human decency,” -- Putin.  Jeez, I wonder why, mate.
The problem is that it's Putin saying it. He's saying so much crap that you can't know what's true and what isn't. Kind of like the boy who cried wolf.
“They’re afraid to inform us on the territories which we shouldn’t strike, fearing that it is precisely where we’ll strike; that we are going to cheat everybody,"

Well maybe they wouldn't think like that if you hadn't proven yourself again and again to be a liar and a cheat.
You cant have a successful war on terror if there aren't any terrorists.
this is one of the dumbest headlines I have ever read on reddit, and thats really an achievment. 
Does anyone else think the US's goal isn't really to get rid of ISIS but to have them and Assad just kill each other off?

The Paris attack probably changes how they'll react but before this I never really saw anything other than bombing raids that forced the fight to happen on the fronts that were most advantageous to the Western efforts against Assad and Putin.....

I've got extra tin foil hats for anyone that's in need. 
Saw this first on r/conspiracy saw both people actually kind of thinking "um yea this could have merit" and other saying its b.s. Nice to see the claim got the attention it deserved.
He makes some good points, but unfortunately he has no credibility.
He is probably the most deft politician out there right now. I rarely agree with him, I deeply suspect his intentions... but holy cow he runs circles around US politicians in terms of political strategy.
Even though RT posted this, it is true. Go google the facts that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and turkey have been supporting Isis. Plenty of proof out there.
Counter-terrorism should indeed be a global effort. 
China's in y'all.  Who else?
This is still an ongoing terrorist attack, and yet world leaders are chiming in with offers of help.

So even though it sucks big time when horrible mass-murder events such as these take place, the feeling of brotherhood that people in various countries all across the world feel for each other immediately afterwards is calming.

Silver linings, you know?
Shanghai tonight

Que last time when hundreds of people died in Urumqi in large scale terrorism, French and other western government condemned China for 'surpressing minorities', and expressed regret when terrorist leaders were executed.

I hope France wake up this time. 
Meanwhile under the French embassy's Weibo(chinese twitter) people are spamming mockery towards French by saying the state should have trialed the freedom fighters before executing them, "I express my condolences to the innocent but the french government need to improve human rights and stop oppressing minorities" etc.

These are the words used against China from some western medias in previous Muslim attacks in China. So they are just rejoiced and call it Karma.
They have their own Uighur terrorist problems. Don't forget the extremists that killed hundreds of their own. They need to collaborate with France to stop these terrorists. It's good when countries come together in the name of counter-terrorism.
I would like nothing more than the full force of all the Western powers, plus the EU, plus Russia, plus China and other Asian nations all in one huge show of force show these fucking cowards what's up. I really do believe the world is genuinely pissed off together. We have our bitching matches with China and Russia, but this can be something to have common ground and common enemy. At least with Al Qaeda, they were very specific in targets. These ISIS fuckers just want to spill blood. We need to go in with our full military might of all our nations and show them what real shock and awe is. Vive la France, Vive la liberté!
China has a big problem with muslims too in Xinjiang. Nearly 200 stabbed by muslim radicals in just one attack last year at kunming.   
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attack
This is not really new, and not really related to the Paris shootings. China, for a long time, has been putting itself out there and looking for partnerships in combating Islamic extremism. 

Urighur terrorism is a huge problem in China, and it's now it's even a bigger problem because Urighurs are joining ISIS or other Islamic militant groups, and then possibly returning to China.

There has been a lot of rumors on Chinese military forums saying that China is paying Russia for intel on Urighurs in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East. 
You probably read too much into it. What he said is "fight terrorism together with the rest of the world communities to ensure security for the people". Just diplomatic language, no hint on "combat". China of course wants a better relationship with France. But sending Chinese military to Syria will be considered a big help to Russia. 

So unless France specifically asks for help, I guess China will be watching without actually doing anything.

Some people really want to see China join the fights so we can see WW3 later. The fact is Chinese military lacks actual combat experience. They have some new hardware but never used them. Also, a Chinese military intervention won't happen without UN authorization.

Lets all unite instead of being enemies. Talking about China, Russia ans the West.
China is not going to get militarily involved with ISIS whatsoever. The extent that they will help is sharing intelligence.
[deleted]
You know, this is actually a pretty good opportunity for peace between China, Russia, and the West. We should put aside our differences for now.
Now lets see if the west are willing to play nice with the east
Good. The more the merrier. 
Now ya dun just pissed China off. 
肏你妈了个屄 , 我们来了 !
Xi couldn't have said pointless words like "pray for you"  or something related to "GOD"  - so instead, he offered concrete support.
oh china.......RIP Terrorism

Say what you want about China...but they dont tolerate this kinda shit at all
Talk is cheap. Everyone says shit like this the day after. Canada promised to do everything it can, yet on the same day pulled out of the ISIS bombing coalition
With Russia getting involved and now China are going to get involved. It seems as though fighting ISIS is uniting the planet. ISIS may have kicked a hornets nest by attacking France. 
This could be big news. Putin is also calling for coordinated efforts, but he's likely just posturing to get back in the club G8. China has always been standoffish about ISIS. Interested to see how this plays out.

Bonus: Lots of world powers set aside their difference to fight a common cause.
It would be wonderful if our leaders could work with Russia and China rather than against them to combat ISIS. ISIS is the continuation of Zarqawis thugs. I did my time in Iraq. These terrorists kill anyone that doesn't conform to their murderous ways
World Wars Ep. III: Force Awakens
As long as the vile mind-poison known as islam exists, I am all for the most ruthless, big dick motherfuckers in the world coming in and cleaning house.  


So the US, Great Britain, Russia, France, and now China.  Isis just pissed off 5 of the baddest motherfuckers on the planet. If they get Germany and Japan all riled up it'll be the beat down of the Millennium.
MY GOD ITS JUST LIKE COMMAND AND CONQUER GENERALS
You're reading too much into it.

He just said he want a global joint effort to combat terrorism, as usual, nothing special for the French here.
Remember when the middle east did that whole oil embargo - and the U.S. threatened to internationalize the world's oil?  Why can't we just be like "each country takes control and appropriate actions for all their extremist, if they don't the rest of the world comes in and fixes it for them - along with a new government."     

Yes, I am angry, this probably doesn't even make sense.
What would great if a Muslim country offered to hunt down these pieces of crap. 
This is very important. Now, all five permanent members of the security council are definitely on the same page about this, at least right now. If the UN is going to do something, they should do it as quickly as possible.
It's about time China out on the big boy pants and start getting involved with the rest of the world. 
Its about damn time China got involved!
China can into diplomacy
Even China knews how stupid Islam is...
So is this just gonna be like the end of watchmen when world peace is achieved through a common enemy
Look...Ben Carson is now right. He is amazing. /s
For some reason, I thought this said "Charlie XCX" and I was really confused about the comments.
Talk is cheap. Do something about the root cause - Islam. Identifying and killing individual terrorists is probably not going to get us out of this situation, we need to come up with something that will effectively reverse the growth of Islam.
Its sad it takes such a tragedy to get everyone to hop on board.
[deleted]
Yeah!!!!
They'll help France but they won't help anyone else. Atleast with their high budget ~~communist~~ military, they should kick a lot of ass.
Why the French of all the people to attack?
This is fucking huge...
Shits getting real
So.. basically what you're saying is China, Russia, USA, and pretty much all of Europe is about to fucking descend on ISIS.. that's pretty much every country with a world-ending military force in the planet. Give them fucking hell. Make these fuckers regret the day they were born. 
China flexin' on em.
Did anyone else read 'Xi' as roman numerals and think it was a thread about China's national football team?
The wars in Afghanistan/Iraq are projected to cost 4-6 trillion when the last dollar is spent. How about we just give the Chinese/Russians a trillion to go end Islamist extremism. 

Will be cheaper in the long run and we can all act outraged when they do the things that are necessary but we don't have the stomach for.
lots of Chinese diaspora in France.  
I wonder if China will get into this in a big way seems as of late they want to show military muscle. The middle east is about to become a place to show off the military tech countries have been working on for the past few decades. Hopefully US, EU, Russian, and Chinese forces work in tandem and figure out what to do in the part of the world.

Getting rid of stable yet heinous dictators and sending weapons isn't working suprisingly. (sarcasm)
You can't fight terrorism, it existed for centuries. They have no identity, no ties to any countries. We will be just wasting the lives of our own people just to kill a few fucks who probably want to die anyway. The whole western involvement in the middle east has been a huge mistake. Any country that joins the West will be in risk of terrorism. 
Good. But let's start with fighting religion in the arena of ideas.
If you thought the west were brutal soldiers, just wait til you see the Chinese in combat. 
"...just let us station a few million troops in your major cities and we'll fix the problem for you."

"OK"
This is brilliant. 
Love how we just call him Xi now. 
You know you've fucked up when China is like, "you need some help bro?" 
Would China actually join the fight it would be awesome news! :):)
Ah shit.  
  
ISIS' bout to get gang fucked Sasha Grey style.  
  
It's gonna be disgusting, but in a good way.
Why are we not showing support for all the people killed by terror attacks in Middle eastern and African countries that happen every single month and greatly exceed what just happened in Paris. Seems a bit one sided the attention we/the media gives European countries.. Hum maybe because they're white?? And yes I'm a white Texan.
This would be a massive shift in China's foreign policy. Not a good thing 
Now ISIS fucked up real bad. China has over 2 million soldiers, if they want, they can overwhelm the terrorists like it's nothing.
He's just saying.. 
Goddammit.

We don't need to "combat terrorism", we need to deal with capitalism, eradicate poverty and stop nations who go to the middle east and blow shit up just to steal oil, thus destabilizing the entire world, quite literally.
Empty words. Let me know when Chinese jets are flying over Syria.
Fuck combating terrorism.   Combat the fucking underlying ideology that wants to kill you.   
As much as people are hopeful here, I'd say China would never actually put in its military and join forces with anyone else. 

First off US would be frustrated China's getting too involved in EU affairs, regardless of the initiative. Secondly, China's a paper tiger. It boasts impressive power to the world but all it has is hand-me-downs from Russia, hell China's aircraft carrier leaks even when it's on a parade. Last but not least, China seldom gets involved in issues that don't really concern them. They talk a lot but never help, the only time they'll send out their forces is when Japan or Vietnam pisses them off, or when there's unrest in their own country, like the uyghur. 

So don't get your hopes up people. 
Hypothetically speaking, how many nukes would take to remove that part of the world? Those countries arent that big.
China: hates terrorists but embraces cyber terrorism.
What a joke. Everyone is a hypocrite. China supports Pakistan based terror groups which are responsible for 26/11 Mumbai attacks where more than 600 people were shot in a similar fashion. The governments of the West and China need to rethink their foreign policy. China commits a lot of atrocities against minority groups especially Muslims.
I for one welcome WW3
I'm the only shmoe who read it was "rapper Chino XL says willing to join France"
It's about time China does something to help police the world. 
I'd be nice if the Chineese could join the party in Syria.
Ben Carson was right!!!!!!! /s
What does China have in terms of military power? I mean, every little bit helps but what do they have?

I'm not trying to sound snarky, just curious on what the Chinese can bring to the table. 
If this were an indication that China were moving toward becoming a member of the liberal world order, that would be great. To any Chinese nationalists out there: loosen up on your political system and no one will be nervous about your growing power. If you had liberte, egalite, fraternite as a core ideology, the world would embrace you as brothers. Please, for peace and for your own prosperity, become one of us, become a liberal democracy. We'd love to have you. 
Impressed no one is thinking of the plot from spectre!

Sidenote: awful Day :-(
That's it, let's forget about everything they are doing to their neighbors and own people.
They sure know how to help and support people.
China is just trying to justify their killing of Uyghurs. Soon we will see Myanmar will join this 'combating terrorism' shit too, Israel, India, Australia, Rusia, Egypt, Syria etc..will say the same shit. These countries are sponsoring 'state terrorism' against their minorities i.e they are using 'terrorism' to combat terrorism. Bloody hell.
China has been itching to bloody their troops for a while now.

They need to catch up with NATO /  Russia in terms of modern tactics to deal with insurgency and combat experience.
ITT astroturfing
Now Ben Carson is one step closer to not being wrong about China being in Syria.
yea right stfu china
California
We really don't need China attacking the United States.
I hope Xi remembers that the next time he blocks global efforts to combat extremism. Both he and Putin have blood on their hands. Look up their recent vetoes of several UN efforts to stop Iran and the Syrian conflict. 
they should hack into ISIS communication networks
Wow, Ben Carson predicted this
People also have to remember it's not just twitter accounts being suspended. Anonymous is also targeting more than 100 known VPNs so they are forced to either use public VPNs or none at all which helps as much as these accounts being suspended. They are also targeting know websites that incite violence / extremism 

This is just a small part of the effort against Daesh however it's more than most are doing so I suggest people hold their tongues until at least next week and then we can all assess how effective anonymous has been.
&gt; Alex Poucher, a spokesman for Anonymous

Ummm...
Next, howabout Daesh bank accounts? 
It started out at 900 accounts this morning....
I'm guessing next will be the Playstation network?

Considering the rumours going around saying that they used PS4s to communicate.
5 point 5 fucking K
Well, that escalated quickly.
I'm imagining the Twitter account sorting process at Anonymous HQ.

*ISIS.*

*Not ISIS.*

*ISIS.*

*Not ISIS...*
What's stopping them from just creating new accounts? I know their followers will take a bit of a hit, but they will still use the same recruiting hashtags for people to find them. Like people were saying in another thread, the best thing for twitter to do would be to create a shadowban that feeds them fake retweets and favourites, and then their activity could still be tracked as well. 
The whole "ISIS is a master mind of social media" meme needs to die. 

They've been pushing about how strong and secretive their social media presence is but I remember reading an article a bit ago about how most of them have about 2k followers and are being monitored. I'm sure the CIA has the twitter firehose and if they were really concerned they would have shut these down already.

If I can put my tin foil hat on for a minute: the government's endgame is backdoor encryption.
Genuinely curious...what kind of impact does taking down these twitter accounts have? Does this affect recruiting primarily or operations?
Why doesn't twitter do this?
Imagine how awkward it'd be to have an account completely unaffiliated with ISIS and get a Message from Anonymous saying they're taking it down for being affiliated with ISIS.
Soooo why cant Twitter just take down ISIS accounts themselves?
Wait, wouldn't taking down these accounts make tracking these individuals more difficult? While I respect what anonymous is trying to do, I can only assume certain agencies already knew about these accounts and were using them to attempt to track or get information. Am I wrong with this assumption?
If anonymous really wants to have an impact they should drop names of financiers and accompany proof. Shutting twitter accounts grabs headlines but changes nothing.

Ironic that 72 virgins are fucking them while they're still alive.

Oh my god, the use of the word Daesh is actually spreading. I thought it was just a /r/CringeAnarchy post lol.
It makes no sense to me that these accounts are still up in the first place
I know the FBI and other intelligence agencies want these accounts to stay up to track them but they should be taken down because some of these are recruiters no doubt and I'd rather have it impossible to get connected to ISIS online.
Good to see the FBI is back in the Anonymous business. Shout outs to Sabu
Anonymous *claims* to take down 5500 twitter accounts they *claim* belonged to ISIS.  They don't exactly have a stellar history of honesty.
why doesnt twitter just get rid of them? (serious)
The ISIS terrorists must be shitting themselves now they can't tweet a picture of their latest decapitation without having to create a new account.....
Wow... They weren't joking when they said they were going after ISIS.

Not like I have anything against that though, I'm French so this is great revenge. Fuck ISIS.


Here's to hoping it's over 9000 by this time tomorow.
This has interrupted the data collection efforts of government agencies monitoring the known ISIS Twitter accounts. Blunder. Attention mongering. 
5,500... [or 900](http://metro.co.uk/2015/11/16/anonymous-identified-900-isis-related-twitter-accounts-and-now-theyve-been-suspended-5506452/)?

EDIT: [or 3,824](http://news.softpedia.com/news/one-day-later-anonymous-already-takes-down-3-824-pro-isis-twitter-accounts-496258.shtml)?
Someone please ELI5 me - How they do it?
Why didn't twitter deny or block these accounts in the first place?
Ummm...actual question here. Why can't Twitter do this itself?  I mean.  It's their servers, right?
This morning it was 900. Now it's 55000. But that's according them. And of course, we have no way to prove it cause they're all, you know, Anonymous. First, do you think that the military couldn't shut down those accounts or VPNs if it really mattered? And do you think ISIS doesn't have atleast one or two tech geeks at their disposal? 
a) how do you find 5,500 Twitter accounts related to an organizations?

b) if they're so easy to find why wouldn't twitter shut them down?

c) why wouldn't they use the Twitter accounts first to spread misinformation?

d) what sense does it make to take down Twitter accounts only - how will this stop terror?


While I think this is pedantic, it does beg the question (leave me alone)...why hasn't our government done this already?

This whole thing is squirrelly.  The day after the attacks France bombed ISIS training facilities over there.  Why haven't we done that already?  WTF are we doing over there?

Also - if we are bombing the crud out of them like they tell us, why do they even have Internet and/or cellular access for Twitter to begin with?  Its no wonder people think Obama has zero leadership on this issue.
Wait, why is Anonymous more effective at stymying terrorists' social media efforts than Twitter is?
It's a sobering thought that there are  enough of those scumbags to even open 5500 accounts. 
If I was ISIS I would communicate via imageURL and use steganography to embed operational data within the images.  Then post all day as hardcore rightwing Murkans with right wing dummy memes - have the dim folk propagate the meme and you have broadcast to a nearly untrackable mass of people.  

And really encryption is nearly unbreakable now - they can probably just email each other ecrypted messages.  

And if they get caught - most encrypted volume progs allow you to set up a dummy volume revealed by a fake password.  The real volume remains hidden in the noise.  
*Daesh
O.K so Anon have now done a kind of interview with the BBC on this subject and there is something that should worry most people.

The BBC asked...

&gt; What happens if you post the name of someone who turns out not to be involved?

The reply...

&gt; It is difficult that we make a visible profile without having the absolute certainty, we do not share information as soon we have them in hand and we spend countless hours to investigate and verify it. 

Now.. i'm no mathematician but it's is less than 1 week since the Paris attack (even less time since Anon announced their interference) and there are simply not enough hours that have passed in which Anon could possibly have spent "countless hours" on each of 5,500 suspects!

Anon would have needed an army of Islamic members to trawl through that amount of people in just a few days.

What this means is Anon are probably doing very little due diligence. They certainly can't be performing any proper checks to their claims. That's supposing they even have a very large number of Muslim members to assist them (which would be needed.) I seriously doubt they do. 

I think Anon are just happy to get involved in something they can hack that state level actors won't go after them for. They know they can hack in the clearnet when their targets are KKK or ISIS. I'm sure they would much rather still be hacking Sony or Microsoft or other 1%ers but have found somewhere they can do what they do without the same comeback. (arrests)

It's also worth remembering the average age of Anon members (going by arrests to date) we are talking predominantly about teenagers here. That's what worries me.
Why wasnt this done earlier?
Anonymous shouldn't be in the news unless they hack bank accounts.
they actually did something, the absolute mad men
Anynomous is just show
People in these comments are fucking idiots (sorry for cursing at you)

1. Anonymous uses twitters report system to take them down (thousands of reports)

2. Twitter wont censor cause then they will be asked to censor elswhere etc etc.

3. The goverment dosnt get any information from twitter that can help (wow yeah you can link to an article about one instance).

4. ISIS uses twitter as a propaganda media and it helps them recruit/convince followers to join them in syria.

5. Goverment is not taking them down, because it is not worth their time, and money.

6. anonymous is doing a good job so stop talking shit. Every bit helps

7. alot of the accounts are doublicates, meaning that they are taking down multiple accounts from same guys that keep making new ones to spread propaganda.

Why would this matter? They can just make new ones in a minute
Does anyone want to help me try to Hack ISIS bank accounts and steal their money? I have no hacking skills at all but it would be interesting to see what legal repercussions there would be if successful.

 Also lucrative.
And I was just listening to a news report about how governments can use suspect's social media data to track them and predict their movements, etc. Good job anonymous, you might have made it harder to stop terrorism.
[deleted]
Not sure this would actually help, as ISIL probably reveals a good deal of info which could be used for intelligence gathering in operations against them.
Twitter seriously need to up their game, I mean shit if I was in charge of some kind of social system as big as that, I wouldn't want the fucking Daesh posting/recruiting through it.

They need keyword bans and blockers. Filter hashtags and ban them. You post about ISIS you get warned, next post is a ban. Something like that.
We pay our governments to protect us in the form of taxes. It takes Anonymous to do the job. Thank you. 
Perhaps some of those Anonymous hackers live in France, or have friends and family there and really touched a nerve with them?
This is good news. Thank you Anomymous, and keep up the good work. Coincidentally, this also answers a question I tried to post on reddit, but could not find a forum for, which was: Why can't hacking groups like Anonymous shut down, or significantly impede the ability of ISIL/ISIS/DAESH to communicate and recruit via the Internet?
No one going to ask how they 'took down' that many password protected accounts??  I call total BS
It doesn't inflict that much damage in Daesh but it's more than what you and me have done.
5.5 fucking K. That's some good shit. 
Well that escalated fast
Oh, I thought there were only 10,000 people in ISIS?
When did Twitter security become a joke?
We did it, mayne.
"internet savoy"
Wonder how long it will be before ISIS hires hackers to hack them. Anyone remember the failed attempt to do this same thing to the cartels in mexico?
So if they can take down their twitter accounts, could they possibly find out where these folks are? I feel like most social media has some sort of "where your at" feature now. 
You go girl! 
900... Then 3635(or some number) and now 5500. Amazing job guys!
That'll show em
Is it over 9000 yet?
Glad their isn't a create account button so this won't happen again 
OMG! ISIS is fleeing Syria in droves!
I'D BE OKAY WITH AN ANYONYMOUS HOLIDAY IN THE FUTURE! one where we all off from work and share in a day of political activeness, global and environmental consciousness, academic betterment and over all just making active positive contributions to our communities and thus, the world! Does anyone know how to go about creating such national/international holidays, other than having a boat load of money?
[deleted]
The best Anonymous can do to counter ISIS is throw keyboards at them. Not much can be accomplished by these keyboard warriors.
I wonder if ISIS Goes on reddit and is on this thread...
Well, that escalated quickly.
Why didn't they do this before???
C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!!
Why in the world does Twitter even allow ISIS to use their services??? I was listening to this Jordanian Middle East specialist on the radio this morning and he was talking about ISIS and social media... they are heavily dependent on social media and he proposed that taking social media out of the picture would be one of the most efficient ways of weakening ISIS. 
Well, the cartels were able to quickly put a stop to the shenanigans
the question is why didnt twitter take them down ?
Can someone ELI5 why it takes Anon to shut down terrorist social media pages and not the company itself? How isn't twitter in trouble for allowing those pages to remain open considering how much damage they're capable and are causing worldwide? 
&gt; Alex Poucher, a spokesman for Anonymous, told RT.

Anyone else see the irony here?
A typical example of brown hat hacking. 
Which is it? 3.8K or 5.5K?
They won't be able to play hashtag games!  Take THAT, terrorists!
OK so they're doing something...i know everyone thinks people will be 'tracking' or whatever but it works to disrupt them and give them busy work. 
Wouldn't the efforts of Anonymous be better put to task cleaning out the bank accounts of people who are funding the terrorists. So you know like empty the bank accounts of prominent Saudi families.
Big deal, gotta hit them where it hurts. Apparently they are making 2 million dollars a day from oil sales to Turkey why can't Anonymous empty all their bank accounts it's not like they are storing cash under their mattresses. Maybe that's not possible idk. 
Makes me proud :-)
I'm enjoying how this number keeps going up.  

  
I hope they are able to get into some key sytems and make them hurt.
Anything that can be done to disrupt any of their communications is a good thing. Force them onto radio.
Probably a stronger response than any other effort thus far. 
What about isis sympathizers with reddit accounts?? Oust those muthefuckers too.
It's surprising how productive this group this, but being that their name is "anonymous", for all I know, some of this group's actions may be ambiguated with those of state actors.
"Alex Poucher, a spokesman for Anonymous, told RT."


Did that dude just use his real name, or is he already known or something?
Anonymous needs to join forces with fsociety, now shit will get real.  Screw up their oil fields by pressurizing the pipes to make them explode. 
So I guess that means the war on terrorism is over. I feel much safer already.
Can someone please explain why Twitter doesn't just remove these accounts?
Yeah, that'll learn em!
i frickin love these guys.
I really dislike these "take downs" of social media accounts tied to ISIS, ISIL, Daesh, or whatever you want to call them. The reason: It is much better for us and the intelligence community to allow these guys to talk, and wait for them to slip up. With so many accounts, one of them is likely to. And we can use that information to take down the real life people behind the accounts. 

Taking down the accounts does nothing but force them to make a new one. It dries up one public intel source for no reason other than to make a scriptkiddie feel good about himself. Remember the old saying "loose lips sink ships," well, that applies to them as much as us. Let them talk, that way we can track them, and get a sense for how they are connected in social networks, to better gauge who they are, and what they are planning, if anything.
  The idea that this is not good - assumes that all of the 5500 twitter users are also competent IS people - which I seriously doubt.  That could mean that mistakes will happen and that will make these people more visible.   Yea!
Why isn't Twitter fucking doing this?
Now how will I know what ISIS had for brunch?
Oh, so it's actually state aided propaganda. 
Taking down Twitter and other social media accounts isn't going to stop the next bomb.
By anonymous you mean the FBI
Why hasn't twitter shut them down? 
How do they "take down" an account? Is Twitter that easily hacked or ?
Next, figure out which american citizens are bankrolling these guys and doxx 'em. 
Anonymous, the ever present good guy who beats up bullies. They always get me right in the feels.

Is twitters security that bad that its so easy to take over so many accounts?
who the hell has this many twitter accounts. This number can't be real.
they are anonymous cuz they don't want anyone to know how often they sit in moms basement with cheetos dik. like to keep that anonymous.
got em hard Anonymous
Only yesterday a few pessimists were bitching around how Anonymous is powerless and cannot do anything at all. Rekt.
We don't need a billion posts about how Anonymous got some Twitter accounts taken down. You guys are so embarrassing.
yeah losing  those twitter accounts will sure put em in their place
How many of those are false positives I wonder?
I'm just thankful they have stopped there haste speech. 
Be me

In Anonymous

No girlfriend

Haven't bathed in a while

etc etc

But seriously, good job Anons!
Good job Anon. Oh the government is gathering intel? Yeah that sure helped last Friday.
Thing is, deleting these accounts may not be the best thing. 

Sure, you've removed a method of communication between ISIS members, but you've also removed a way of monitoring these conversations, seeing as their Twitter conversations could have been monitored. 
Do any of the people who wear that Guy Fawkes masks even realize what he stood for?
That'll teach'em! This is the equivalent of me putting my 2 year old in time out. 
Wouldn't it help to leave them up to see whose corresponding with who?
5 point 5 fucking kay!?!?!?
Get those daesh bags
How does Twitter not shut them down?
None of these claims have been verified to my knowledge. It's just a random number they choose to tweet to everyone.. rather ironically.
ISIS Apparently has some super stealthy secret encryption now that makes them all but completely invisible to the US and Isrealies.... ;) Oh and Russians too.....It's amazing to me how they can outwit us at every turn lol.....Maybe the NSA should hire some of their well known computer scientists.

Now daesh has pissed off Russia,USA and all of NATO and now they have pissed off some really good hackers......I'd say they're pretty much fucked.
I'm sure this will get ISIS to surrender rather quickly.
Won't somebody think of the goats?? (now that they can't 'recruit' their wives anymore)  
Wow. They must be so.....annoyed.
Anonymous is doing what the NSA and GCHQ is supposed to be doing with their data collection? 
The point being?
The closest ISIS is going to get to 72 virgins.
Maybe I am mistaken but I thought that some of the main people in Anonymous were now taking orders directly from the FBI (like Sabu).
It's kinda ironic that ISIS hates the west so much yet relies on western tech companies to spread their fanatical ideology etc.
IIRC while these accounts are a recruiting, propaganda and communication platform they are also easily found and monitored. Taking these accounts away could drive them underground and make it harder to find out what their up to. 
wouldnt those have been somewhat useful in tracking terrorists?
I just heard about someone who's real name is Isis and got her account shut down. So yeah, gotta wonder how many of those are actually IS.
We must ask, why hasn't twitter done anything about ISIS accounts? 
Anonymous is not an actual entity, Anyone anywhere can be a "member" of anonymous by participating in cyber warfare. Or is there actually a hacker group untraceable by any government out there that occasionally claims responsibility for some form of data breach... seems like every post regarding this "organisation" makes "them" out to be an actual physical manifestation of super hackers, Not just "A hack happened and anyone could have done it"
Thank you. 

My favorite is that isis called them "idiots." Like ooo oh man that stings lol. 3rd grade response.
[deleted]
5 point 5 fucking k
Everyone is saying this is a good thing, however I am sure those accounts were being closely monitored at all times by international government agencies.  Essentially, anonymous has just removed a huge source of Intel for counter terrorist operations.  
   
Edit: so I see I'm being down voted, and I'm not sure why.  How is that not a viable argument.  Think about how much meta information there is in a twitter post.  You can see who posted it, who looked at it, who replied to it, possibly where it was posted from...is that not valuable information for counter terrorism?  Do you think the CIA are high fiving right now?  Fuck no, they are scrambling.  They just lost a lot of intel. 
I seriously doubt those Twitter accounts were important to ISIS.
**900, 5500, 3824**  
  
Anyone have any other randoms numbers from post titles about how many accounts Anonymous has taken down?  
  
Pick a number for christ sake. 
At least they did something. Now hack their bank accounts so they cant buy weapons.
5.5 fucking K
[deleted]
Stupid and childish. They can register new ones in a second. 

Instead they could have been monitored.
Intelligence agencies were probably monitoring those for information. Now they'll have to find them all over again.
Good work lejins.
The keepers of the online force are returning balance to the online force. 
I don't know about this. Maybe intelligence agencies monitor those social media accounts, and shutting them down forces ISIS to use other methods of communication that aren't so easily tracked? 
Why did we need Anonymous to identify ISIS related twitter accounts? What hacking skillz were required that a twitter account is used by ISIS?  Why couldn't twitter identify these accounts?
this actually probably just hurts US intelligence. Like it or not, but social media is a key tool in tracking peoples and finding leads. Seems a bit counterproductive to hinder that, however if it pisses off Daesh, well fuck em!
Who fucking cares, tell me when they can make a computer blow up on the person using it.
Great!  Now how is the NSA going to monitor ISIS?
 I see no proof in this article
I don't understand why a group of hackers have to take down the twitter accounts.  Why doesn't Twitter just take them down themselves?
That'll show them.
Oh man! They did it! No more ISIS!!!
This is pretty stupid now that intel agencies have to start all over again
ELI5: Why isn't Twitter being held responsible for these accounts and why don't they take them down?
Guys! Anonymous did it! The war on terror is over!!!
Am I the only one wondering why the fuck people in ISIS have twitter?
Wouldn't it be better to leave them up and monitor to determine locations and identities?
The anon I know would have taken different steps. Oh no, twitter down. *psft*
Because making another twitter account is real hard.
Good work Neckbeards.

Good work.
So Anonymous' contribution to the fight is by limiting speech? 
Itt:people who dont understand what anonymous is....
As great as it is that these individual account are being flagged and taken down, weren't we gathering intelligence from some of these accounts?  
[deleted]

The power of the internet. It allows these filth to spread their horror, but there are a hell of a lot more people talented in using it than ISIS. Go anonymous!
Snake their bitcoin accounts and send it all to charities.  
Well the Iranians are in France, so a better headline would be: Iran won't dine with French if wine is served.
This seems like such a Sim City headline lol.
I was at a meal after a funeral where there was wine. One of the people there, a neighbor of the deceased, was Muslim. I don't know how devout, but he'd performed the Hajj once. Someone who didn't know his religion offered to pour him a glass. He said no.

That's it, that's the whole story. He didn't make a big stink out of it or insist that we shouldn't drink either.
Reminds me of Sir Winston Churchill's demands in order to dine with the Arabs.

"My religion requires a strict diet of alcohol and cigars" LOL
Just serve non alcoholic wine. Then nobody's happy....
*...making any photo ops showing the consumption of alcohol and non-halal meats out of the question.*

I know they mean pork here, but I really want to imagine an Iranian journalist staring at a photo of a Boeuf Bourguignon and trying to figure out if the cow was killed in a halal manner or not.
Just use the diet coke can.
Only the French can say fuck you in such a beautiful way.
I don't drink but when I go out to dinner I don't demand that other abstain.
When Australia's foreign minister was in Iran, she donned the ~~niqab~~ hijab. As did Catherine Ashton. Refusing to adhere to the recipient country's cultural taste is poor etiquette.

That being said, there's also another issue at play here. Rouhani has won big victories over the hardliner bloc back at home with the nuclear deal and partial thaw in diplomatic relations with the associated western countries. The hardliners reacted quite poorly and have just arrested journalists in a show of force. 

Were Rouhani to attend a meal with wine, the conservative media and politicians at home would have an absolute field day with portraying him as a decadent atheist hedonist and Khamenei would be forced to act. I suspect this is Rouhani ensuring that his opponents have nothing to hold over him. 
i worked for heineken for years, some of my colleagues were muslim.

they said brewing beer or working in the presence of alcohol wasn't an issue as long as you don't drink it.

and moreover, if you're in need and have no other solution it's also acceptable to eat non-halal food.

basically, you can be in contact with alcohol or non-halal food if your job requires it. it's not haram unless you feast on it.
[deleted]
Respect for culture is a two-way steet. France can respect Iran by providing non-alcoholic beverages and Iran can respect France by allowing them their traditional wine with dinner.
I was going to be mad at France, but then I realized they were the ones hosting. 

   I wouldn't be going to Iran and demanding pizza and cheese burgers. 
"The French, RTL said, counter offered with a presumably alcohol-free breakfast — which the Iranians promptly rejected because it appeared too “cheap.""

Well now they're just being petty. 
You're in Paris and get invited to dinner. Then tell the host not to serve wine in their own house? Yeah good luck with that, you delusional fucks.
It's cultural politics. Iran wants to bend the hosts by dictating their traditions and the French are refusing to bend because they know a seemingly insignificant thing like that would be seen for what it is by their countrymen because it's obviously not about refusing to drink wine on any personal level.
Love the framing in the title.

France: "This will be the menu. Fancy French stuff in there!"  
Iran: "The wine and non-halal meat are unacceptable. We know Rouhani wouldn't have to drink it anyway - the idea of inviting him to a meal where a Frenchman will be allowed to have wine is already too much. Change your menu."  
France: "Well changing the lunch menu that way won't work for us. Tell you what, let's have breakfast instead. No alcohol, no non-halal meat for anybody. Works for you?"  
Iran: "No. It must be lunch. This isn't about alcohol or non-halal meat anymore, it's just that a state breakfast prepared by the best French chefs would _appear too cheap_."   
Washington post: "France won’t dine with Iran unless wine is served"
"Duel citizenship"
After reading the headline I thought of how incredibly rude and unnecessary complicated France reacted.. Then I read the first few lines of the article and directly see that France offered an alcohol-free meal, which Iran then declined because it was TOO CHEAP for them!! This is the hitting point.. This seems so unbelievably rude for me. Why do you have to show you are more than a normal human being? Might be things are different in Iran, but if you are invited to dinner or whatever, you are going to accept what comes on the plate at least in this case after you have told what you are allowed to eat and drink following your religion..
My initial thought was "As the host, France should accommodate what seems like a fairly simple request."  But then I thought, "Would the Iranians reciprocate and provide wine if a French delegation were visiting Iran.  Hmmmm...probably not.  
Does France place an extremly high value on food, ubiquitously, everyone in France loves and takes pride in their food?
None is likely to see this comment but as a Muslim i think this manner of behavior is atrocious, i spend a lot of time with friends who are non-religious who drink and smoke marijuana as well as cigars, i don't partake in those activities nor do i demand they make ''special'' food for me, ill eat from what i can and ignore what i cannot. I do not feel the need to enforce my preferences on others, because it is my belief that religion should exclusively be practiced on an individual level.  
Islam ruined Persia.
Iran can't just order a pepsi?
For once I agree with France. 
The meeting is in France, not Iran. France should be able to serve whatever they want. It's not like it's taking place in Iran...
The French have a saying about wine.

"A meal without wine is like a day without sun."
If, as a result of all this, the French Government is short of company for a State Dinner, I'd be more than willing to pop across the English Channel and devour all the pork and wine they can throw at me! 
This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/11/10/france-wont-dine-with-iran-unless-wine-is-served/) reduced by 82%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; The Iranians, according to France&amp;#039;s RTL Radio, insisted on a wine-free meal with halal meat - a request based on Islamic codes that amounted to culinary sacrilege in France, a nation that puts the secular ideals of the Republic above all else.

&gt; In the international negotiations to reach a historic deal over Iran&amp;#039;s nuclear program, France had taken one of the hardest lines, and Rouhani&amp;#039;s visit is meant as a rapprochement - though whether it will amount to that remains unclear.

&gt; Following the sweeping deal that would lift international sanctions in exchange for limits on Iran&amp;#039;s nuclear capability with strict monitoring, European companies and governments are tripping over themselves to court the Iranians.

That's going to be a huge dinner party.
eat and drink what you like but stop dictating it to everyone else
Iran needs to fold on this one. Denying the French wine during a meal is pretty much the worst thing you can do to them, and yes, that includes mass nuclear genocide.
I don't understand. No one is forcing the Iranians to drink the wine and the French can have halal and regular meat on the menu.

This is stupid.
Qu'ils mangent de la brioche.
I am reminded of Churchill's meeting with the Saudi King.

"While visiting King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia, Winston was informed he could neither smoke nor drink, for religious reasons, during a banquet thrown in his honor. Winston wasn’t having any. He informed the monarch that, “My religion prescribed as an absolute sacred ritual smoking cigars and drinking alcohol before, after and if need be during all meals and the intervals between them.”
I had french sales reps refuse to come to a 10 am product meeting without wine being served.  It was so awkward. 
I'd damn sure need a couple of drinks to help me tolerate an hour with an Iranian ayatollah.
This is by far the most French headline I ever read.
Am I the only one concerned with the implications of duel citizenship?!
No wine with dinner! Outrageous! Uncivilized! Inhuman! 
Interesting. There is no universal prohibition in Iran. The government allows non-Muslims to produce and consume alchohol. So why would they have a problem with the French having their wine? I assume it's all about the president and his supporters losing face and the goodwill/acceptance of the religious hardliners as some have suggested. Unfortunately this kind of politicking (if that is really what it is) only adds fuel to the fire that is FN. 
" France, a nation that puts the secular ideals of the Republic above all else."

Gave me a blue, white and red boner.
Nice to see the powermongers of the world keeping focus on the important issues.
At some point, people will wake up to the fact that Rouhani is not actually "moderate" at all.


The dude is a fucking cleric. Imagine if a Catholic or Orthodox priest held a major government role in your country? That is Rouhani. How many of the modern, educated, pro-Western, liberal, America-loving Iranians of the diaspora do you see dressing like him?


At least Ahmadinejad had a PhD in civil engineering and was a mayor of a city of more than 10 million people. The only reason Rouhani seems "moderate" is because he is more careful with his words to Western media (which are translated because he doesn't speak English despite somehow having obtained a PhD in Scotland).


 People give him way too much "benefit of the doubt". Ask any Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Green Movement member, or other ethnic/religious minority if their life has changed for the better with Rouhani.
I'm willing to bet if a France delegation went to Iran, they would be perfectly fine with no wine served.  But, those sentiments are never reciprocated by the hard-line muslim world.  Keep your sharia laws, and your customs from 2,000 years ago in middle east. 

How petty and childish. My 4 year old niece is more mature.

It's like a vegetarian demanding that nobody else eats meat either. At a grill restaurant. 

I can understand wanting halal meat (even though I don't agree with it, halal is cruel) but they don't have to drink the wine. The French aren't forcing their mouths open and pouring it in. And then declaring the alcohol free breakfast, who the hell drinks at breakfast though, too 'cheap'. 
/r/soundsaboutright
This is really just saying, "Fuck you."

If a friend is coming to dinner who is vegan, I will serve a vegan dinner.  If an asshole is coming to dinner who is vegan, I will serve roasted suckling pig with meat broth in EVERYTHING.  Can you put chicken broth in cake?
A Frenchman without wine? Travesty!
relevant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfUmW_Mf5qc
i mean, if you're a guest, you should be acommodated. if iran is inviting france as well as other countries, they should at least make some effort to acknowledge their culture. for fucks sake, just because i'm russian it doesn't mean that when you come i treat you to dinner all you can eat is potatoes and vodka. even if it seems petty, not shoving your religous cock down the throats of people that are just visiting seems like common courtesy, and if iran can't comprehend that concept, it can eat microwave dinners in the kitchen by itself. 
Too right! You want to turn up at my door and dictate what I can and can't eat, at my dinner party?! Well guess what's on the menu now, son? My balls. I require you balance them delicately on your chin, before gargling thoroughly.  
Vive la France!

Way to stick to your guns.
If people actually read the article and are able to comprehend what it going on, the Iranians are in the wrong...not the French.
Perfectly understandable.  For instance, I absolutely must have booze when dining with my in-laws.  It nicely numbs what would otherwise be an insufferable experience.  Sober, I am very likely to blurt out what I really think of them.
Simply because Wine is at the table does not mean you have you drink it. 
That title may be a little misleading because, realistically, the French won't dine with *anyone* unless wine is served. Which is, in my opinion, quite civilized. (After all, the Iranians don't have to drink any. The wine isn't going to jump out of a glass or bottle and into their mouths.)
Since I'm one of the few people who read this:

It's worth noting:
"The French, RTL said, counter offered with a presumably alcohol-free breakfast — which the Iranians promptly rejected because it appeared too “cheap.” The two leaders will now reportedly settle for a face-to-face chat next Tuesday."


Finally! A way to make sure the French never step another foot in my house again!
When it comes to wine, the French find a backbone. Classic.

That was a roller coaster.  Every paragraph swung from "the onion" to "not the onion" and back. 
As is their right.

Iran wont want any thats fine but they have no right to deny it to anyone who isnt beholden to their muslim laws and dietary practice.
ITT: No one actually read the article
safe-spacing Iranian style!

No wine in MY safe-space!
This all sounds so petty and stupid for both sides, like each country is being represented by toddlers.
This is just grandstanding and appeasing to the general public by the French.   
I'm certain if there were a country that had Satanism as their religion and said something similar.  
"We will not dine with France/England/America/Italy unless there is an upside down cross and a goat's head on the table."  
People would have their knickers in a knot.    

Sure religious customs are ancient and archaic, however when it comes to state matters those differences should be put aside.

where does the article say that France "won't dine with Iran unless wine is served?" All I'm seeing is that Iran wants to dine with france without wine. 
An extremely shitty title.
good
This is like a vegetarian refusing to dine at a table where others are eating meat except crazier.
Funny headlines masking extremely complicated diplomacy. 
[That's the other way around](http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2015/11/10/hollande-rohani-et-le-vin-de-la-discorde_4806203_3210.html): Iran won't dine with France if wine is served (and wine will be served).
I don't understand why we have to bend over backwards for religious beliefs, why can't their be a compromise? Wine can be served at dinner but they don't HAVE to fucking drink it... 
Congratulations to the French for putting a religionist is his place --- which is private and should be kept to himself. If he doesn't believe in drinking wine, fine! Don't drink it. The same goes for every religious doctrine on the planet. People should keep them to themselves and never foist them on unbelievers. If only our so-called secular government would do the same ...
Good on you, France.
What if they make halal wine? from infidel grapes that were ritually slaughtered?
Why isn't it good enough that the Iranians drink something else? Why do Muslims insist on imposing their exotic cultural practices on non Muslims? Muslims need to be more respectful. Perhaps Iran is better off closed off to the rest of the world as much as possible.
When you turn down an invitation to dinner with the president of France - a dinner involving some of the world's finest meats and wines - something at the back of your head should really tell you you're doing something wrong.
This is the most French way to refuse something. 
Obviously both countries are influenced by internal politics: an Iranian leader cannot allow himself to be photographed on a table on which wine is served (this would be ammo for islamist hardliners), and a French leader cannot allow himself to "submit" to islam-motivated requests to change local protocol (this would be ammo for right-wing hardliners). 

So there's no solution that saves face for both parties, besides just cancelling the dinner... which really is no big deal.
More like "Iran won't dine with France unless wine is not served".
They just don't want to be seen less than 10m from a bottle of alcohol.


gotta have your priorities.
[First thing that came to mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZMwKPmsbWE). 
But I'm le tiiiiired.
Iran doesn't need wine to be savage. 
What an ahole
Always with the petty bullshit. These people aren't fit to be "leaders".
I say go Vegan with glasses of water. Win win. 
They should just Facetime
I don't see what the problem is. For those that don't drink, just serve the wine and then not pour yourself any. 

Easy, right?
Reminds me of the story where the Queen of England insisted on personally driving the Saudi Prince around her estate (this being deeply traumatic for the Prince, as women aren't allowed to drive in Saudi Arabia) http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/23/queen-elizabeth-king-abdullah-driving-story_n_6533236.html
I get it. I won't dine with my in-laws without beer or wine either. 
America won't dine with Iran unless justice is served.
Way to go France. Nobody fucks with my food no one should fuck with your food.
The headline should be: Iran won't dine with France unless alcohol isn't served.
At first look I read it as "Fiance" instead of "France". 
http://i.imgur.com/dTGZBmL.jpg
Serve them some swine.
They seem strangely unable to resist temptation - hide the wine, hide the women. I wonder why that is.
"Bring your selves but leave your namby pamby backwards religion at the door"  -France.  Bro4life.
Totally with France on this one. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Or fuck off.
Well I'm not dining with iraq unless justice is served. Wine would be nice too
As they should.  Stop giving in to oppressive customs in the name of political correctness.
The moment you realize all the world leaders used to be and still are, spoiled little brats.
When I welcome jewish guests at my home, I avoid veal scallops with cream and mushrooms (a favorite of mine), whether they're religious or not. Not because they may mind, but because I want them to enjoy the experience most comfortably. It also happens that once, I had a religious jewish guest whom I served seafood inadvertently. He tasted it, because he wanted to please me.

Petty disputes of this caliber at this level of state is really grotesque.




I stand with the French on this.  Either allow/provide wine or go pound sand.
Accommodation is a two way street. 
Why should they care what other people eat? Just don't drink the wine if it's not in your belief to do so. 
Then tonight we dine in hell!!!!!
This seems like a plot line from Curb Your Enthusiasm
Possibly the most French thing I have ever heard.
maybe they could compromise and serve a nice Shiraz


So you come into another country and expect them to cater to your whims.  This is why the world hates these people.
Honestly, we (the US) need to sanction these guys back to the stone age again, it's clear they're not ready to "come out of the corner".

Requiring female guests to cover themselves - because they're viewed as inferior.
Demanding others observe their religious views.

Change has to come from within, and it's apparent that there isn't a will to change, so why do we continue to waste time with them? Send them back to stick huts so they can't build a bomb and let's focus on things that matter to the civilized world.
That's such a misleading clickbait title.
Why is it that clearly very few read the article? It almost seems that most just read the title and wanted to comment on the story they know nothing about.
that seems a litttle rude... isn't drinking against Muslim religion?
Halal meat is pretty good so I can see accomodating that but yeah, the French are basically saying "join the civilized world" with the wine
In vino veritas. 
"The French, RTL said, counter offered with a presumably alcohol-free breakfast — which the Iranians promptly rejected because it appeared too cheap..."

I guess reasonable compromise is against their religion too.




If the dinner were in Iran, I would say that the French should eat without wine or pork, but in France the Iranians should stfu and simply not drink wine.
A pox on all the people who use what-I-eat as evidence for look-how-good-I-am.

Its a device to divide populations and cause trouble.
Serving halal meat is fine, I mean you can do beef or chicken or something but demanding that other people not drink wine is a total dick move.

Iranians suck at diplomacy
Seems reasonable to me.  Serving something versus consuming it are two different things.  It would be unreasonable if the French demanded not only that wine be served but also that Iranians must drink some of it.
Of course. What sort of barbarians eat dinner without wine?
I maintain a similar policy with my mother in law
France won't do anything unless wine is served. 
Of all the terrible things that Iran does on a regular basis, *THIS* is the one where France puts it's foot down. 
i notice they didn't stipulate: wine that has not been pissed in.
I love France. Anything to advance Secularism in any way is fine by my. Why the fuck do the Iranians care if the people they are dining with drink wine, they don't have to.
Next they'll say "We won't dine with you unless you grow long beards ". These Muslims I say...
That headline reads like a South Park script. 
Meanwhile Italy won't participate unless there are underage prostitutes.
Good for France. Fuck bending over backwards for peoples own personal superstitions. If they don't like the way the French dine, then don't go to France (or Germany in this case) to dine. I'm sure the French don't make demands about food and drink when they go to fundamentalist islamic countries. These backwards people need to adapt and assimilate if they want to be a part of the world community 
Smh at the nut jobs here defending Iran. You don't get to go to a dinner and tell your host what to serve. If wine offends you, sit at the kids table. 
Never trust a man that doesn't drink.
I didn't know France was a person. Or Iran. 
F that. When in rome do as the romans do. They should serve traditional French food and drinks, including wine. 
That's like saying "I won't meet with India unless we can do it at a steak-house."

It's disingenuous. They should be better than that...
Mad respect for France right now. Drink our wine or fuck yourselves. Either way.
Misleading title.  More like Iran won't dine with France IF wine is served.  France always serves wine at these dinners.  It is a custom.  Iran (muslims) expects them to change their custom because sharia.
All I have to say is fuck Iran and fuck it's backwards religion. Good for the French.
France be like "Je ne pense pas"
Maybe Iran isn't ready to join the rest of the world and needs to go back to their litter box of a country to grow up.  Sounds like a bunch of cultural Neanderthals climbing out of the cave for the first time.


Fuck em. 


Rarely do I say this...but...way to go France! 
im iranian and FUCK ISLAM. 90% of iranians are only muslim by papers. i hope we get rid of this shit fucking islamic government. 
It says a lot about how small, ignorant and *crazy* your God is when what *somebody else* is drinking offends you.
Muslim diplomats are like that shitty kid you used to play with who, when you went over to his house, got to decide what you were going to do since it was his house, and then when he came over to your house, he still got to decide because he "was the guest."

Sounds like the Iranians are not very culturally sensitive.
The Shari don't like it
Well then tell the Iranians to fuck off, they can't expect to be catered to everywhere they go. They demand people follow their culture when they have guests and simultaneously demand people follow their culture wherever they go. It is the epitome of acting like a spoiled child, especially towards a country whose people are likely not too happy with your culture all things considered.
I too would need to be 3 sheets to the wind to be able to dine with the Iranian leadership, or really any politicians anywhere for that matter.
As long as the Iranians don't have to drink the wine this seems a reasonable case of "respect my customs and I'll respect yours".
Of course France dines halal only with the Saudis. France also sucks their dicks professionally.
Never change, France. 
And make it Shiraz wine.
muslimism
The French will wine.

The Iranian will whine.
Seems like both are being dickheads. Why don't they just serve win to the french, and just serve halal meat to the Iranians. Why the fuck is this even an issue? 

Fucking kids man, let's introduce a law where if you act like a tool, you immediately get fired and replaced with someone who wants to actually work to get shit done.
they should also hire a caricature artist.  Everyone loves a cartoon of them rollerskating with Muhammad. 
Good!

I'm sick of constantly bending over backwards to these people.  Don't drink wine or eat pork, fine, but you sure as fuck aren't going to stop the rest of us no matter how "offended" you might be.  
— a request based on Islamic codes that amounted to culinary sacrilege in France, a nation that puts the secular ideals of the Republic above all else.

That's awesome
I'd wanna get drunk if I had to be diplomatic to religious nutjobs who are developing nukes, too. 
Fucking alcoholics need to legalize weed!
One more reason to dislike religion... This is all it does, creates conflict.
The country hosting the dinner should choose. However, I do think that you could possibly suggest a halal version of the food for the Iranians, and just let the French drink their wine. Isn't that a win-win?

On a side note: you don't fuck with a Frenchman's wine. You just don't.
Insisting French do not drink wine is as offensive as insisting that Muslims do drink it. 
I love the French attitude to Islam;
'We don't come to your country and insist on Wine and Pork at your table'.
I wish more countries stood up to Religious 'Rights' like them.
France is the best. What is life without being able to enjoy a little wine with your food?
Good, you come to fucking France you respect their culture.  GTFO if you don't like it.  You always have the option of fucking not drinking wine, douche bags.  Good god religion is so fucking stupid.  You can't even be in the same room as wine because of your moronic beliefs in fairy tales?  Stupid.
This is the same country that was bending over backwards for the Saudi's?

EDIT: Looks like I hit a never, the comment was sitting at 10 points and now its down to 1 point.

Get real, this is purely political nothing more. The French were ready to temporarily **annex a PUBLIC beach** for the Saudi government. 
I love it when people tell me they only eat halal or kosher. It let's me know immediately not hang out with them anymore.
[deleted]
Have to stick to their itinerary, or there won't be transit funding. Serve them the wine.
I'm just stunned WP wrote "duel citizenship". D'uh! *Dual. 
Why is it not possible to have Halal for the Iranians and wine for the French? Is there a problem with that? Who's the dick here?
Why don't they serve mead then? It's HONEY! 13th warrior reference?
https://youtu.be/XZAt-_gwvXY
I love it too, but perhaps halal alternative? Or just an water alternative and still eat dinner together?
And perhaps 3/4 of Iranians "secretly" have liquor at home.  The option, a full Continental breakfast. Perfect!
Did they give $3 to Wikipedia tho?
Wow. That's just amazing. If he lived to 80, that'd be like donating 2.5 mil every single day for the rest of his life! That's really great.
Ugh, please.

If they really cared, they'd donate all of their Likes.
I remember he donated $25 million to the CDC to help fight Ebola, hopefully he and other billionaires will help prevent future pandemics from being catastrophic. 
That will be worth a lot of money assuming we all keep donating 99% of our time to Facebook.
I tried to calculate how much the remaining 1% is worth, but the calculator at my desk only has room for 8 digits. 

I wish my name was charity. 
All in an effort to build the Mark Zuckerberg School for Kids Who Can't Read Good. 
Does that mean he will be relinquishing  control of Facebook?
You can say about Facebook what you want, but this is really a great and unique gesture of the guy. Kudos. 
Let's not try and find a reason for why this is not a good thing or explain an ulterior motive. Let's simple bask in the amazing simplicity of someone giving 45,000,000,000 dollars to good causes.

This title is misleading: it's not all going to charity per se: "The spokeswoman further confirmed the initiative is structured as an LLC, and not as a charitable trust. While charity will certainly be one of the money’s destinations, it will be far from the only one. The money, according to a Facebook SEC filing, will go to 'philanthropic, public advocacy, and other activities for the public good.' One such activity: private investment." http://www.buzzfeed.com/alexkantrowitz/not-all-of-mark-zuckerbergs-donation-to-go-to-charity#.tb2KxJryJ
What you all don't know is Charity is the name of Zuckerberg's side bitch. 
Same thing BIll Gates does. They donate to a "foundation" all their shares at their basis of nearly zero. That's right, their "cost" of their shares are zero because they founded the company. If they ever sold the shares, they'd have to realize the profit at market value and pay a 15% capital gains tax (still far lower than the 35-50% the 99'ers pay after adding in payroll tax). By donating to a foundation, they will *never*, I repeat *never* pay tax on their fortunes. Zuckerberg will never pay a dollar's taxes on 99% of his $35B net worth while the 99% of Americans pay taxes on their EARNED INCOME.  To add insult to injury, his 'foundation' will forever earn profits on its investments tax free, as long as it gives away 5% of its assets per year. Even an idiot can pull a 10% return on investments and a highly paid fund manager can pull 20-35% returns, essentially tax free. Furthermore the 5% he HAS to give away instead of paying taxes he will milk every dollar worth for publicity AND he can donate it to any cause he wants. Unlike the 99%, we can't choose how our taxes are spent. Of course people he donates to will owe him and he basically buys influence. This is how special interest works. So the 5% he gives away will bring him more value because he's going to give to politicians/causes/organizations who support Facebook.
  
All the billionaires who claim they pay too little taxes take advantage of this special loophole for billionaires. Warren Buffet, George Soros, Bill Gates, all donate stock with a low basis to avoid ever paying taxes on it. The concept of the "charitable remainder trust" was practically invented by Bill Gate's tax lawyer to avoid paying taxes.

An ultra-rich person realizing that a couple hundred million is more than enough and the rest of that money can go to some good use. 

While not unprecedented, it certainly is all too rare and very respectable. 

Still not re-activating my FB though. 
Cancer research please.
That's 450mil left.. I think no one needs more than that to live. Wealth is fucking pointless after a certain point unless you are actively trying to better other people's lives with it. 

I really like the wave of billionaires giving away their fortunes, I hope it continues.

He could cure cancer and Reddit would still complain that he didn't cure Aids. I just find it sad that everyone is instantly trying to see the negative things in this. There is no way this is not an admirable thing to do.
I am starting a charity right the fuck now!

Fun fact: **Facebook pays no taxes.**

Zero, zilch, nada.

You know, running a website isn't easy and there's simply *way* too much overhead for silly peasant things like taxes. In fact, they need our help. Lord knows that Mr. Zuckerberg would go broke if he had to pay taxes. How would he feed his one kid without a cool $45 billion dollar nestegg? So he's on welfare.

That is, with Facebook's tax refund of a mere +$429,000,000 annually, good ole Mark gets by. Aren't you happy to be helping him out? Giving the guy a break so he can promise to be so charitable? I mean, Facebook only makes about $12 billion a year. What would they do without your tax dollars? Lose their shirts, that's what.

Say Zuckerberg, you want to be a real big hero? Pay your taxes, right now, and open a charity dedicated to lobbying other companies to pay theirs. Then we can *all* be part of this big charity that made you a billionaire, then maybe we can have things like homes and jobs and educations! 

Like you, Mr. Zuckerberg, I've slept in a car and have lost my low paying job, so I know how it is. But if you really want to make a difference, look at what everybody else is doing in April and join on in. It's great fun, an American tradition. Google "what are taxes?" If, indeed, Google knows.

If you guys all do that, then we can build our *own* hospitals and things, and things like roads, and our education system can maybe get a fresh coat of paint, and maybe we wont need a bunch of charities if the American people have the services they think they're paying for.
Sorry to disappoint some of you, but I read a bunch of sources and it seems like this whole "charity" thing is actually just a way for Zuckerberg to get away with tax. What they are doing is creating a for-profit LLC and they can use it to invest they money any way they want. I feel like his letter to his daughter is also a way to PR his company. Before publishing that letter, he probably went through all the executives and PR agent at Facebook. 
Anyone who believes he's doing this out of the kindness of his "humanitarian" heart has been suckered. He's simply sheltering the stock within a "foundation/trust". This way he doesn't pay tax on the stock, nor can rivals touch it. Generational wealth preservation. Just like the Rockefeller's, Carnegie, etc. Seriously, do some research on those foundations. He gets to preserve his wealth, not pay taxes, and look like some humanitarian saint. Sorry, not buying it.
That's great of them. Not sure how he's going to live on the remaining $450,000,000 though.
Bill Gates or Warren Buffets charity? So when do they return the favor so that they can keep their wealth in the family and get huge tax deductions?
I'd rather he just pay the taxes he owes
first pay your due tax
Pretty damn awesome.
He and Priscilla are giving away non-voting shares, over a lengthy period of time, to charity.  What charity is not specified in the article, but I would be surprised if it isn't the charitable organization that he and she themselves formed.  So, they're giving away shares to, in effect, themselves, if they control the charity.  For that, they probably get a huge charitable deduction against their taxable income and retain control over the assets.  A charitable organization can invest its own money and make income and hold that income as capital (untaxed) to give the organization strength through wealth.  It can employ family members to run it.  They can then do a lot of things, including find projects to fund as charitable giving.  The gifting plan extends, apparently, over his and Priscilla's lives--in other words, over 40 or 50 years.  They cannot possibly spend all of their money anyway, so this allows them to shelter some of their income from taxes (by the charitable deduction) and still have control over how they want to spend their excess money.  This is a win/win for them since it appears that it is being done at great expense to them, and it creates great image points for them and Facebook, but it actually has very little if any negative impact.  He still controls Facebook, he will still be CEO of Facebook and they will still (if they control the charitable organization) control all of the shares (and its value) while it's in the charitable organization.
But you know by the time they die Facebook shares will be worth what Friendster shares are now.
I'd be so pissed right now if I was that baby.
They should invest it into research, such as energy, genetic engineering etc. instead. Technological progress will some day fix most of our problems, that we face today. 
They said "During their life." Massive PR stunt, they aren't giving away jack-shit right now.
This is part of a new trend for elites to park money in "philanthropic" mutual funds that are managed like any other mutual fund and essentially do nothing but avoid taxes. Get real, nobody is going to give all their money to charity without something in return.
IIT: The most gullible on the face of the planet.

"Oh look at Mr Zuckerberg, super charitable and all around nice guy!! Just like the Clintons, Buffet and Gates!!"

Setting up charitable trusts is a tax dodge and its a means of keeping/spending as much as you want without losing it. 

Also, private foundations are beyond the scope of scrutiny. [Look up any private trust](http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.profile&amp;ein=562618866#.Vl5qxtCFbdk) you wont find detailed information on them (like you would public charities).

&gt; The IRS requires that private foundations file a Form 990-PF which differs from the document public charities file. This makes it impossible for us to compare the financial performance of private foundations to public charities.

http://www.salon.com/2013/04/12/10_tax_dodges_that_help_the_rich_get_richer_partner/

&gt;Whether or not the charitable donation is a scam in whole or in part depends on the answer to that old question: qui bono? Aka, who benefits? That’s where the real scam takes place.

&gt;**And there’s no legal requirement that a charity must spend its wealth. In fact, IRS rules require only that charities spend about 5 percent of their investment assets annually, and all or part of this amount can be spent on salaries and “expenses,” rather than devoted to the charitable purpose the charity purports to be serving.**

&gt;**So, what happens with a charitable trust, set up by a billionaire, and controlled by one of the billionaire’s children? The child gets a job and a salary for life. Maybe a mansion to live in and entertain in as a fringe benefit. This is a great gig for the heir.**

I wanted to bold a single sentence, but just read it all. It's so painfully obvious why billionaires are dumping their money into controlling charitable trusts. [money they still control]

So yes, maybe they do some good with the little bit they have give away, the benefit is likely greater to them.

Applaud this? Is it different than paying some tax and it getting squandered by government? Well, maybe not better, who knows. Instead this method probably benefits them more or gives them more control over how they influence the world with their non-taxes. Does it benefit the average pleb more? No idea. But I wouldn't bet a life on it.

**Edit:** [Here is 990 PF for the Gates Charity](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihq_e3pbzJAhXRsh4KHTNGC94QFggcMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gatesfoundation.org%2F~%2Fmedia%2FGFO%2FWho-We-Are%2FFinancials%2F2012-BMGFT-990PF-PUBLIC-DISCLOSURE-FINAL.pdf%3Fla%3Den&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjOW2nL6u8g8b-q0SBvHEcl6c6QQ&amp;sig2=4GJ0Cgz0ouVJ2LYkAH0Pag) you wont be able to see where all the money goes like you would with a public charity though. But you can see what they've contributed and what they made this year. And some of their expenses.

the human fund, its money for people
A 'pledge' is different than actual giving. A lot of things could change in future.
PLEASE just cure my diabetes. I want ice cream
Isn't that funny, he married a nice girl and 3 years later he's giving away 99% of his hard earned wealth...
CHARITY GAME BILL GATES 
Wait, can't we say, that indirectly, anyone that used Facebook, more so the ones that have been using it and using it heavily for years, indirectly gave to charity?  Not to take anything away from Mark--not at all!  I just can't believe that... literally us being connected, sharing photos, and press Like button translated into 45-billion dollars for charity.  Is this not true?
I could work for 10000 years at my current salary, and that would only get me to the 1% Zuckerberg keeps 
Ok, I have had to eat my words against Zuckerberg after this.
"Yeahhhh, but...its *mainly* from me." 
- Mark Zuckerberg
daughters real name: "charity"
Leadership. Thank you. Makes me look at my own kids and think about what more I can do.
I hope they donate it to "The Human Fund"
Very  Impressed. Hope Mark and his wife know giving money away is one thing, solving a problem and providing solutions can be very different, they have to keep eyes on where the money goes to  and check the result, that is called being true responsible for your action.
but what are they going to do with all of their Likes?
wow. well. capitalism  depends on philanthropy  to last. good for Zuckerberg  and the US government  system 
Im confused. 

How does donating shares to charity work? Are you literally giving them a specified amount of your shares? Then they can sell and cash in whenever they would like? Or does he sell off his shares and donate the profit? Either way I don't see how you can translate the shares into "physical" cash without making the stock price plummet because of so many shares being sold off. Unless the time span of the donation process and the volume/market cap of FB is just so high that it won't effect stock price in the long run?


I really don't know, could anyone explain it for me? 
It's kind of odd how I probably wouldn't have the same reaction if it said:

&gt;Zuckerberg, wife pledge to invest 99% of their Facebook shares, about $45 billion, in research and technology.

But, in reality, that could often have just as much, if not more, of a positive effect on the world. The example I like to think of is Salk's work on the Polio vaccine. Think of all the money that went to caring for Polio victims for years before the vaccine was available. Polio has affected human beings since at least the time of the Egyptians. It's affected us so long that we weren't even using money when it first started terrorizing us. The really stunning fact is that we now know we are not actually that much smarter than the Egyptian people. It's not that we have evolved more intelligence since then, and that is why Salk was smart enough to create the vaccine. Theoretically, we could have had the vaccine hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago, if we had known what questions to ask and what things to focus on.

So compare centuries of resources put into caring for victims of Polio, only to have them eventually succumb to the terrible disease anyway, to what Salk's vaccine did. But many times, resources spent on the kinds of things that lead to Salk's vaccine are seen as much less noble than resources given to charity.
...to the Human Fund?

Don't they just roll their money into a tax free foundation?
Better use that 45 billion dollars to fund Elon musk's companies and for killing all the terrorists with out a trace in the world, that is much better than giving to charity...Bill Gates and some other billionaires will take care of the charity work...!!! 
Charity is the name of their new-born daughter
Oh what do I care, all the money in the world couldn't cure my acne!

Probably true, but oh well, I hope this money will actually go towards solving serious world-wide problems (and not just sneakily pocketed by those running charities, legally, or illegally)
The Human Fund hit the jackpot!
Sweet. They can start with the charity of me. 
Cynics are saying this is a way to avoid taxes .. setting up a multi-generation charitable trust that keeps the money within Zuck &amp; Co's control, able to pay trustees, directors, employees, etc. which would all likely be members of Zuck &amp; Co.

EDIT: Which isn't a bad thing? I mean, we set up tax laws to incentivize charitable giving. The people most capable of dedicating their lives to giving are people with loads of money. The only things that are questionable: 1) What proportion of money do they actually give? 2) What types of donations are made?
Didn't take long for the comments to spew into some less than funny Wiki conspiracy.  I thought the real story was far more amusing.  Don't give your kid billions.  Check.  Right thing to do.  Telling the world what you've done and blathering about human potential, great expectations, what might become of the future world and of the new little one, from the guy that kind of came up with fucking Facebook?  Spare us.  Donate your billions quietly and honestly or don't.  The world truly doesn't care.  You will be forgotten.  Don't expect much of your kid either.  Speaking of billions how many ultra privileged and/or filthy rich kids grow up into kind, caring human beings that actually change the world for the better?  Oddly enough less than the fabled one percent.  Go fucking figure.  Genius doesn't breed genius but greed sure as hell breeds greed.  Good luck with that.  My bet is Max takes all and becomes an antichrist figure.  You go Max, you little Satan spawn.  Start killing before you can crawl.  Off your parents first.  That's the true sign we're looking for.    
He shouldn't give it away... he should hold on to it and use it to influence and buy responsible businesses that are non profit. By giving it away it's going to get diluted to a degree and then they'll be back to square one like the fisherman and fish analogy.

He should get into impact investing etc.
I pledge if I ever get 45 billion dollars that I'll donate 99% of it to charity.

That would leave me with 450 million dollars. 

Oh woe is me whatever would I do? I'd be too poor to go on.

In the end, this is obviously a PR stint, a pledge is not definite, and he stands to gain a LOT more money the longer people take to figure out that he has created the single greatest database of human beings on the planet, usable by governments to not only identify people, but also know everything about them. 

not really to charity. it'll be to his own organization, doing what he thinks the world needs.

god save us
Maybe I should start a charity
to his own tax-exempt charity!!! RUBES..
in 5 years time facebook won't be worth shit. 

I'm 30 and when I was 25 I was mad into facebook, now i visit some of my 30 year old friends facebooks and they're all dormant. Maybe it's being popul;ated by younger people and I'm just getting old. But my nephews and neices (16 y/o) use whatsapp and instagram etc. They want to keep some stuff private and don't want parents, uncles bosses etc taking a peek at their social lives.
Apparently the 1% still wants to hold on to their 1%.
Wannabe Bill Gates
And uhhh who says facebook stock will be worth 45 billion over the entire course of their lives? 

How can you all make the assumption that this generosity is worth 45 billion? He's not cashing it out and giving it away now. He's giving away stock over the next 50 years.

Think of how long AOL lasted, or myspace. Think of what their stock is worth today. Facebook could last 5x as long, that doesn't mean in 50 years Zuckerberg will have given away $45 billion... why has no one brought this up?
Billionaire donates entire wealth to his own un-taxable charity account might be a more accurate title.
Finally... cure for baldness.
What charity will he be giving all this money too? Or is it more than one? Even so, why doesn't he invest in something that can help everyone like clean energy. 
Facebook and Chan having a baby..
How about Facebook just pay its taxes for the rest of it's existence without loopholes.
Hmm, daughter is named Max huh *facepalm*  
Oh wait, maybe it stands for Maxine? That's reasonable...  
No, wait. Maxima. *sigh*
does this mean our Facebook likes might actually help save the world now? what a twist
"*during our lives*" - this is rather broad, isn't it.

Also, it means Zuckerberg is denying his child/children the right to own shares in his company, so I guess he too knows Facebook is a tech bubble that'll eventually expire long before the end of his lifetime. 
As it turns out, this just means that he is going to spend a lot of time scouring strip clubs to make it rain on girls named "Charity". 
I too donated 99.9% of my wealth. Nobody cares when I announced.
A student :)
1 like = 1 stock option donation?
This is literally  enough money to change or impact the world, unfortunately i doubt even a quarter of that will go towards building a better planet. Makes me sad.
... to avoid the worlds biggest tax bill
Not to charity... To a "charitable trust"... That they control.
I'd like to believe this is from the heart, but I know how much money he's saving in taxes from capital gains by putting this into a foundation.
I need to change my name to Charity.
And the daughter Max will be furious in about 16 years!!
When u have THAT much money, donating it to charity seems like a really shitty move. They could make some lifechanging facility in every major country or something. Build an indoor city. Build a monorail across the oceans.
Tax shelter
A lot of rich people donate to charity as a combination tax shelter/trust fund for their kids. 
Zuckerberg, wife create tax haven for themselves;  use daughter's birth as PR opportunity
Sounds good on paper but i bet hes donating it to his own charity. this is a great tax loophole.

when your money is invested as stocks you havent paid taxes on them yet, its once he liquidates his shares that he has to pay taxes... unless he donates them to his own charity.
Goddammnit, the could've thrown a few million at the NIH and help us researchers out a bit. 
Plot twist, charity is a stripper.
I need help with the rent this month and I'm not kidding. Just a couple of shares will do it, Mark.
They named their girl "Max?" Jesus Christ this guy is a psycho
Stop donating to charity! Start donating to science!
It's not a charity though. It's not registered as a charity in the US, it's set up as a business - which he intends to do charitable things with. I guess "pledges $45 billion to charity" looks better than "transfers $45 to his new business which he intends to use for charitable reasons according to his press release".
The charity scam. Another way the wealthy avoid paying taxes on their billions is to make charitable donations. If you donate property, you never have to pay income tax on that donation, whatever it costs you and how much it’s worth right now. Well you might say, at least someone benefits from the charity. Whether or not the charitable donation is a scam in whole or in part depends on the answer to that old question: qui bono? Aka, who benefits? That’s where the real scam takes place.

And there’s no legal requirement that a charity must spend its wealth. In fact, IRS rules require only that charities spend about 5 percent of their investment assets annually, and all or part of this amount can be spent on salaries and “expenses,” rather than devoted to the charitable purpose the charity purports to be serving. So, what happens with a charitable trust, set up by a billionaire, and controlled by one of the billionaire’s children? The child gets a job and a salary for life. Maybe a mansion to live in and entertain in as a fringe benefit. This is a great gig for the heir.

What about the taxes due? No income tax is due on the money the parent donated to set up the charity—even though the parent may have made the charitable donation so as not to pay any tax on an appreciated asset.

Similarly, no estate tax is due on this donation, ever. And all the money donated to the charity is protected from divorce, or any creditors because even though the donor’s heir controls the charity, the law says that heir does not “own” the trust.

The non-profit sector is a very big tent. It houses genuine do-gooding institutions that contribute to society by deploying resources to improve public health, reduce poverty, and improve the environment. But charitable trusts that just go through the motions so that the lion’s share of benefits is realized by a donor and heirs are also allowed inside. And other types of distortion are rampant, such as charities that promote a certain worldview or political philosophy, often cloaked in some form of intellectual or educational rhetoric.

Bill Gates and Warren Buffett got lots of great press in 2010, when they launched the Giving Pledge, committing America’s wealthiest to giving away half their wealth to charity. Since then lots of big names— Michael Bloomberg, Larry Ellison, Carl Icahn, George Lucas, Michael Milken, Peter Peterson, Ted Turner, Mark Zuckerberg– have all signed on. Sounds great—so philanthropic. Would it be churlish under the circumstances to ask for more details?
So, basically, he's getting all of the credit for giving his money away before he's actually given any of his money away.
Except in 15 years when no ones using Facebook 
I hope it's a charity for dogs.
... or they could ask Facebook to pay its fair share of taxes in Europe and provide needed support to governments that have very decent social safety nets.
Hopefully he picks and chooses the right charities to donate to or creates his own, otherwise he's just getting conned.
How will their child survive with only $450 million?
ITT: People who are more knowledgeable and thoughtful about philanthropy than Mark "Suckerberg" who will probably donate it all to the Charity CEO Salary Support Foundation, which is a real charity and a perfect example of how typical charities work.
I'm really happy this is happening, has anyone ever donated this much in their lifetime?
Start a charity. Move all your money into it. Hire your kids to lead charity. Since it's a private charity, no one sees the records. Kids spent $1 billion on house and don't have to report it.  It's a charity, so it's tax free.  

My joy of seeing the 1% donate to charity was ruined after I read an article from an old Reddit post about how it's a tax avoidance scam for the super rich.
They could have started by not being unethical douches by making all of that money selling privacy in the first place. 
wow. I did not see that coming.
Neat.
Damn you, Zuckerberg, those poor kids need food, not Facebook stock!  How do you expect these impoverished children to even check the value of their holdings, much less monitor their growth?
[Let's hope he does a better job with these donations than he did for New Jersey's public schools](http://www.npr.org/2015/09/21/442183080/assessing-the-100-million-upheaval-of-newarks-public-schools)
Oh Wow that the great news.
Fun fact they started their own charity a while back, plot twist all 99% is going to said charity.
Hold on misleading title.  Charity was not mentioned.

"to promote equality and the human potential." Is what they said.

That could mean so many different things. 
Mr. Zuckerberg - Would you please use it to pay off the users student loans who got signed up for the service when you had to have a .edu?

I only need like 75k :P
The people looking at this negatively are the same people that got all bent out of shape about people with the French flag on their profile pictures and how they were "empty gestures". Pessimistic, snarky assholes who feel the need to shit on everything because their own lives are shitty. Fuck em. This is awesome, hands down.
Donating to charity is such bullshit. Who knows if that money will actually help someone instead of ending up in some executives' pockets. Should have just used the money to directly fund something, build a school, establish a scholarship, or something.
I'm led to believe he's starting this charity so he's basically just trying to evade taxes. AmIrite?
They are donating it to themselves.....WTF.

The news would have you believe they were sending billions to 
the red cross or some shit!  Its going right back to them!
They should start their own charities with that amount of money, that way they'll know where the money is going.
Holy fuck reddit is so damn negative 
I wonder if Bernie would still tax the hell out of him?
Honestly, his employees could use more money, too.
What's the catch?
Just to CLARIFY.... The "charity" is his own charity that he owns. Also ALL of that money will be tax deductible now since it's a "donation" and the charity is a non-profit.
Some charities are not charity. 
Meh, he probably overheard the Winklevoss dudes talking about it first
Why are all these billionaires donating their money to charity when instead they could pay their employees more?
"Would" and "during lifetime" which is same as bullshit. Probably got over-existed because of child.
What charity, charity is a very loose term. Some charities are disguised as a political action group. A lot of people use charities as a disguise for political, geo political and right out rebellion and terrorist. Charities have been used to ship ammunition, transfer money to terrorist, and even promote the killing of innocent children. Charities are very often used as a benevolent cover for evil, in more than just a few cases. Not saying that is what Zuckerberg is doing, but probably is. I strongly suspect this because he spys for the govenrment and censors free speech, so I have to assume the worse when they give that much to "charity" Now people can disagree with me, but concerning Zuckerberg being a spy and censoring speech, that is documented.
Look at this. Don't look at Facebook trying to rewrite the internet to its own rules.
I never understood why to charity when most of the charity's take the most from it anyway. When will billionaires start using it better instead of making the CEO of charity's richer. Why not go to each childrens hospital and ask to pay all the debt, go to a poor neighborhood and build and elite school with top of line teaching staff and funding. Help improve mankind instead of giving it away to people who may or may not use all of it for the intended cause.
mark zuckerberg, like all insanely rich people, will start his own charity or hook up with a charity run by another obscenely rich person and donate his own money to it as an elaborate work around to avoid paying taxes on it before robbing most of the money back from the charity or being given "gifts" from the charity worth roughly what he gave them.  this dude isn't just giving away 99% of his money.  It will be stashed away in such a way that his kid can get it later in life without having to work a day.  Or it will be donated to some "initiative" that claims it's aim is to bring some valuable thing to the world in some altruistic way but is really just a way of cornering a market to make even more billions because he isn't stupid enough to think that facebook will last forever and have any value by the time his kid is an adult.

just my super jaded two cents....
At some point...in the vague future. Maybe.

hopefully it works out better than the whole mess when with the los angeles school system. i think it was like $100 mill that is going to be useless because of legal issues. 

Wonder if he also will just roll into the Gates Foundation. 

That would be RAD. 

I could use some facebook shares.
Whose post do I have to share to get in on some of that?
Most people ["Donate to the starving kids in Africa"](https://www.reddit.com/r/southafrica/comments/3uz160/138_corrupt_illegal_and_utterly_stupid_things_the/)  
  
When you actually LIVE in one of these places, you tend to take a cynical outlook on donations.
  

Thanks Mark, I know you are reading this. You are a good guy.
Smart move. Good PR, those shares will probably be worth 1 $ in 10 years.
did he ever give that money to the schools in NJ like he had planned?  I remember after that news, it turned out he had "pledged" the money, on a bunch of certain conditions, and that the school district would have a hard time meeting those conditions.  
What was that sound in the video at around 00:46?
You can't take it with you. 
Good move, but he definitely needs to make sure it's going to into the right places - MSF, Red Cross, Catholic charities, etc. 
If all the 1% would give 99%, that just might change the world.
Did he already follow through with that grant to those public schools? 
I'd rather that money go to science and technology. The curiosity rover cost *only* $2.5B which is a mere fraction of what he's donating, plus many other fascinating missions could be done on less. There is also potential for the development of new technologies that could change the world. 
So does Reddit hate Zuckerberg? Or love him so much they want to suck him off? At this point I'm just confused 
I hear he is pretty down to earth. Know someone who works at the HQ and they see him everyday coming in for work and he greets them personably. Trying to get on there, it seems like an amazing place to work... 
Gates is still the greatest philanthropist in my opinion. But it's cool to see that there *planning* on doing it at some point.
To the human fund?
Well shit, I have to revise my opinion on Zuckerberg ever so slightly.
I can kinda forgive him now.
Am I a charity?
Hey, there, uh... Mr. and Mrs. Zuckerberg? I could really use a few bucks.
He finally got enough likes! 1 like = 1 ZuckerDolan 
Honestly his ownership shares of Facebook are all he will ever need. The value and salary he gets out of Facebook will keep increasing. This is no money compared to what his percent of fb's eventual future value. Keep in mind fbook includes instagram, whatsapp, and freaking oculus.
They can start by donating .01% to me.
That still leaves them with around $450 million in Facebook shares 
I have no idea why, but it just never crossed my mind until right now that Zuckerberg was married.
So he ran out of ideas.

Well, hopefully the receivers take that money and invest in ways to improve humanity other than through assisting state terrorists in spying on everyone and exploiting information asymmetry for black ops and other evil activities.

Go to hell Zuckerberg, you sold out.
Very noble of them, and the other zillionairs that they are following doing the same.  I wonder if it would be better to give to random people though.  Just $10,000 to people here and there.  As a middle aged, middle class family of 4, between the two of us working two full time jobs and one part time, a random $10,000 could really help out. 
I should change my name to charity.
I am a charity :(. I would like some, I know for sure it would make my life better. 
\* Legally changes name to Charity \*

You *promised!*
Why'd he name his daughter after a Nissan though?
This is an amazing commitment.  That said:

This is over the rest of his life though, not immediately.  

Just for easy math, lets say he lives another 45 years (he is 31).  So he gives away $1B a year, or ~2% of his net worth annually.  

Invested well, his fortune would do much better than 2%.   He could actually give much much more to charity and still leave an incredible legacy/fortune for his family. 

&gt; 
Zuckerberg, 31, and Chan, 30, first met at a fraternity party while students at Harvard. They married nine years later in 2012, the day after Facebook's initial public offering.

Prenup
As they damn well should. They would still have more than enough to live wildly comfortable lives. 
Damn that's like giving every US citizen $150. Actually I can't tell if that makes it seem bigger or smaller.
Soooo, do we like Zuckerberg now?
1% of $45 BILLION is a mere $450 Million. Really, I don't think baby Zuck has anything to worry about.
I need a couple grand to get my hernia stitched up which is basically a rounding error for him, think he'd give me some? I'd send a thank you note 😀
I'm curious to know the process of "giving $45 billion to charity."
I hope he signed a prenup.
It's a well known phenomenon that pledges like this are mostly for PR. You think someone is just going to give away 99% of their wealth? Would you? C'mon. 
Wewlad
More meaningful if the do it now... And not to a charity they create
Okay but let's make sure it goes to the correct causes. Not Susan G Komen so the board of directors can claim 90% of the donation. 
... or they could donate 99.99% of their Likes.
All the Billionaires found out about the charity scam.
prestige mode
That is awesome! To give away something you have worked so hard to create and accumulate, is purely amazing! Kudos to him for offering up his wealth for good cause. 
this helps the economy.   wealth needs to be spread, not hoarded by one person.  
Non voting shares right? :/
As the [Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21678272-marine-le-pen-may-win-elections-fear-non-existent-migrant-wave-phantom-menace
) pointed out last week, the vast majority of migrants are still heading towards Germany, but the fear of migration is still present in France and can be seen in support and votes going to the Front National.

But that article was prior to the attacks. So while President Hollande may reject fear, it may be very different for a significant percentage of voters across France.

Additionally, taking in 30,000 over two years doesn't begin to form a cohesive European policy on addressing the crisis, especially considering that just over the last month migrants were entering Europe in the hundreds of thousands.

But with the population of France understandably reeling from last week's attack, I'm not sure there's much hope for cohesive European action on handling the influx of migrants.
When America was accepting a massive influx of migrants through Ellis Island, everyone was required to register on the island before they could access the mainland.

I think Europe needs to take a more systematic approach towards registering migrants. People shouldn't be getting in with fake passports or without being background checked.
As much as it hasn't worked out for the Palestinians (for other reasons); I don't think countries should be looking to permanently resettle Syrians.


The refugee crisis should be looked at as a temporary solution, before securing the country and allowing the return of the refugees.


You can't just let all the good people leave a country (which 99.9% of the refugees likely are) and leave nothing there but a cesspool of extremism and violence.


Let's help the good people out, win back the country, and then return the country to the people and ultimately the people to the country.


I get the feeling that allowing the Syrian refugees to take up residence in large numbers in Western countries will result in pockets of economoically struggling, desperate, and angry refugees.
Everyone will initially be happy just to be in the Western world. Their standard of living will increase dramatically, but then it will plateau for many. It's not a phenomenon that hasn't been observed before.

The same "homegrown" terrorists that left Europe to fight for ISIS, were likely, not too long ago, happy refugees and good people who were given the chance at a new life.



They need their country back, not a new country. 
This really hits close to home. I was one of those refuges during the wars in Bosnia back in 91 and migrated into another country in Europe with my family for a while before coming to the US. The Swiss were amazing people, I didn't realize at the time what it all meant or how lucky we were. It's insane to think that people that were once part of the same country were willing to kill me on sight, a kid; simply for being from the other nation. That over looming possibility that if you are seen by the wrong pair of eyes or caught etc you will be shot or possibly worse is immensely stressful. One thing people have to remember when they close their hearts to the plight of others and demand closed borders is that most of the refuges are families with kids that are just caught in a horrific situation. We're all humans on this planet, only difference is the birth lottery that spawned you in a better situation and to say that others not so fortunate aren't allowed is about as "Fuck you, I got mine." as I've ever seen it. 
It has been known for months that due to the preferential asylum treatment of Syrians (see Angela Merkel's statements), fake Syrian passport market has bloomed.

http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-syrian-passport-market-is-booming-2015-9

http://www.wsj.com/articles/migrants-pose-as-syrians-to-open-door-to-asylum-in-europe-1442013612

2 months ago, a dutch journalist bought a fake Syrian passport with the face of Dutch PM. He warned terrorists could do the same https://www.rt.com/news/315591-fake-syrian-passport-journalist/

The Guardian says it can cost as low as $250 to get a fake Syrian passport. http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/how-easy-is-it-to-buy-fake-syrian-passport



**It has been confirmed that 1 of the Paris terrorists entered EU with the refugees using a fake Syrian passport.** http://www.wsj.com/articles/paris-stadium-attacker-entered-europe-via-greece-1447698583

How many "Syrians" who got in Europe actually used fake documents and are not actually Syrians and therefore can't be accounted for? [At the end of September Germany said about 30%](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/11891219/Refugee-crisis-Many-migrants-falsely-claim-to-be-Syrians-Germany-says-as-EU-tries-to-ease-tensions.html)

You can label me however you want, but I think we have been subjected to the greatest security catastrophe in our modern times. 

**We have watched this unfold and now we watch EU politicians from the same camp that created the mess desperately trying to sweep it under the rug.** After the Paris attacks, Jean-Claude Juncker was the first one to speak of refugees.


Why can't Saudi Arabia or Qatar or some other rich country in the area accept them? It's a lot closer and they have the money and infrastructure to house them, not to mention they already have mosques and other places of worship. Why do they have to go all the way to France and Germany?
These new ghettos are really gonna help.
Legitimate question for Europeans here.

Not sure how powerful your right wing politicians are there, but do you think this decision could swing France far right in the next elections? As well as all of Europe?
You mean rejects reality and risks their citizens lives for political correctness. 
Call me crazy but i feel this is not a great idea.
We had 100 Syrian refugees arrive here in Scotland last night. The Scottish Government had assured us all that they were all Syrian and had been "properly vetted" whatever that entails. One man was interviewed on TV and said he was Jordanian. Another was asked if he was glad that he was in Scotland, "Yes. I get my medicine." That was it. Not one said they were happy to be here, or even thank you. Funnily enough the medicine comment was cut from the News when the report was next repeated. Councils here, full of right on left wing types have been running around with glee arranging houses, schooling and the medical needs for these refugees. Meanwhile I am working with a service charity to help military veterans who have PTSD and other issues and you have to fight for everything we get. One has even been told by our local council he will "probably" slide down the waiting list "if we end up getting refugees". He has been waiting over six months. When we have money to house people from halfway across the world but not our own I ask questions, because to me they are no less deserving. There needs to be a recognition that out of the masses heading to Europe some are genuine refugees but most are "gimmegrants" making their way to the place they think they will be given the biggest handouts. They are NOT refugees, you lose that status once you leave the first safe country you arrive in. I am all for doing what we can for those genuinely in need, not at the expense of our own though, while the rest should be deported tout suite. 
France rejects common sense
TIL most redditors are experts on French politics and what is best for France.
Just because you are being 'brave' by doing something potentially dangerous does not make it a good idea.

"Man rejects fear, goes driving after 5 beers" doesn't make it a better idea.

It's not about doing whatever "rejects fear" or even not doing "exactly what ISIS wants", it's about doing what's best for our countries. If taking in these migrants isn't best for the country, then "rejecting fear" by doing it isn't commendable. 
I love the biased title. I am going to "reject fear" and leave the doors and windows to my house unlocked all night with a big sign on my front yard that says, "Come on in, the doors are open. Please follow the rules. Or not... I wouldn't want to offend you."
Meanwhile, Indiana just told 2 Syrian families to fuck off.


http://fox59.com/2015/11/18/syrian-refugee-family-bound-for-indiana-forced-to-relocate-to-connecticut-after-pences-ban/
France didn't reject fear, it's rejecting common sense. There is no reason they should accept any of the Migrants.
"We refuse to admit we were wrong."
how come the muslim refugees don't go to muslim countries? that's what boggles my mind.
Are they going to have any way of determining if they are real refugees?  It seems like a lot of countries aren't real good at determining that.
What happens if there is another attack in France? Then what?
The problem is you can't have a bunch of devout Muslims living in a multicultural, secular society. The two are incompatible.

The door should be shut on the entirety of the Middle East until they've gone through an Enlightenment Period, and have distanced themselves from religious mumbo jumbo.

When these people have decided that they can live next to: women, gays, non-muslims, and atheists, they'll be ready to arrive in Europe.
There are no terrorist attacks yet because the refugees haven't been incubated for long enough yet. Here's what will happen--the refugees will flock towards Muslim enclaves in Europe because they can't speak the language and identify more with their Muslim brothers than with western Christian values.  They will have kids that will grow up in the ghetto who will feel like they've been marginalized and will blame white western culture for their problems, poverty, and 'lack of opportunities'. Radical groups in the ME will reach out to them on social media to recruit them for terrorist attacks.  Rinse and repeat over and over again.  You are living in a dream world if you think Muslim culture can integrate seamlessly into Christian dominated western culture. It. Doesn't. Fucking. Work.  Oil and water won't mix no matter how hard you try.
Imagine being harassed in Europe for doing things like simply being drunk, catching some rays in a bikini in a public park or for walking your dog.  That is the way Europe is headed and liberals really haven't wrapped their minds around the culture and values they're telling us to accept with open arms.  Ironocally Liberal beliefs will be one of the first things to be persecuted once Muslim traditions take hold.
What a fucked up bullshit post title.
Accept = good, praiseworthy, righteous, etc

Reject = evil, afraid, bigoted, hateful, heartless, racist, islamophobic, etc

Glad to know this issue is so cut and dry and has no other complexities to consider such as economic feasibility; where they're actually going to live; who, if millions of citizens, many of which would be capable soldiers, are extracted and most in the west are against their country getting involved in another Middle Eastern war/conflict, is going to actually solve the Syrian war issue; what you are going to do with all of those refugees once the war in Syria is over, to name just a few.

No, anyone who opposes this is just playing into ISIS's hands and is also a racist. Got it.

Hasn’t it been confirmed already that the fingerprints taken from a man entering the EU in October match those of one of the terrorists killed in Paris last Friday. So why are people continuing to focus on the passport? It’s irrelevant. If is the fingerprints that will prove or disprove the link. And at the moment it appears that at least one of the terrorists entered the EU among the migrants.

And it really doesn’t matter that the vast majority of migrants entering the EU wish us no harm. The fact is there is a percentage that does (and no one can deny that now after Paris). And what many people have issue with is that we have seen thousands of migrants enter and wander about the EU unchecked. Here in Germany they have already reported that there are hundreds of migrants unaccounted for, they have simply vanished. Nobody knows where they are and more to the point, no one has an idea who or what they’re intensions are. The EU seem very sure about their obligations to the migrants heading to the EU however, I would argue that they have completely forgotten their obligations to the people of the EU. So no wonder that people are asking for the brakes to be applied before we allow any more people in.

As for people being reluctant to take in refugees, I think it’s totally understandable reaction. When you read something like this in the newspapers at the weekend...

The arrests – local media said three people had been detained – took place in the Brussels district of Molenbeek that has been linked to several other terror plots in Europe.

The Observer’s Daniel Boffey reports that Molenbeek “was casually described by one Belgian broadcaster as a ‘den of terrorists’, where returnees from Syria have in recent years often made their home”

What do you expect? People are no doubt going to continue to label them as racist and as xenophobic. The Poles, the Hungarians and anyone else who is going to be dragging their heels to take in immigrants. Fact is though that the Poles, the Hungarians and others are looking to France, they are looking to the UK, they are looking to Belgium and elsewhere where there is a considerable Muslim population and they're thinking fuck that for a game of soldiers. And considering all the issues that it brings, the constant issues, the constant threat (and it is now constant, this now is the new norm for certain parts of Europe, certainly for France) plus considering over 100 people have been slaughtered in cold blood by Islamic terrorists in Paris just a few nights ago (at least one of them home grown) who can really blame them.

Reading that about Molenbeek. Who would want that within their borders? If you didn't have it already, why would you want it? Why would you bring that upon yourself? Because like it or not, no matter how you want to argue this, if you introduce a sizable Muslim population then there is a chance (no matter how small) this is what is going to come along with it. And no matter how many times you can argue it is a small minority, fact is that small minority can cause a great deal of harm. And again, it’s hardly unreasonable that many people do not wish to bring that chance of harm to their communities.

Edit Thank you for the gold kind stranger. 
How old is the Trojan Horse? Looks like the same thing to me. 
so TIL the current regime of France will be voted out next election cycle, this is how you lose elections.
Where will the money comes when we can't even help our poor and homeless?
Rejects fear, or rejects logic? Don't be surprised when Paris burns again. There comes a point where compassion has to end.
The failure is not the compassion for the Syrians and others who seek relief from grinding poverty and war. That it has been deliberately allowed to grow to CRISES proportions, then the flood gates were opened by the leadership. There is the failure...in the leadership.
I have an idea. Might be surreal, but bear with me:

What if the the able-bodied Syrian men fought for their country? You know, like the Polish men did during WWII? Or like the Czechoslovak men did during WWII? No? Ok, sorry for asking. I'm sure that they will be valuable European citizens in the future, willing to risk their lives for the western values of freedom and democracy whenever necessary...
You know I don't get it, anyone who comes here with the opinion that they don't want hundred's of thousands of immigrants flooding into their country is downvoted out of existence. I agree it's a shitty situation for the Syrian refugee's but I'll be damned if there wasn't a better option on the table than moving a whole fucking country of people into other area's at such alarming rates that their own citizens are raped physically as well as culture raped. Our leaders are going so bat shit insane about not upsetting their culture and their way of life that they shit on their own peoples way of life. 

We have helped and we have helped a lot. Enough is enough put a stop to refugee's before your minorities are your own countrymen and this multicultural era you keep talking about is just muslim culture. This isn't even about terrorists or terrorists attacks this is about Europe letting immigration go to far and yet still no end in sight. You guys can bash and circle jerk all you want but this is a problem and it has been addressed over and over it's time we put a stop to it and give it some time and care for and provide for the refugees that are here already instead of taking on way to much to handle and letting it get to the point that it isn't doable then having to deal with that issue.
What is with Reddit's circlejerk about these people? Lets get 1 thing clear. A "refugee" is, by EU Law, someone that claims asylum in the **FIRST** country in which they arrive.  All it takes is a handful of those people to turn Europe upside-down. Turkey already lets hundreds of thousands pour through. The liberal mindset of "lets keep letting them pour in, by turning them down we are doing what ISIS want." What kind of "logic" is that? Just don't let them in and deport all islamist extremists that turn up in the fallout from that. 



Granted, I know Greece or Italy isn't exactly prepared financially for all those people, but one thing has to be made clear. When these people march through multiple countries to get the benefits that they are seeking, that is calling benefit shopping. The majority of them went to Germany and will apply to GER, Sweden, and France. Lets call a spade a spade here and cease this reddit circlejerk.





EDIT: A word 




EDIT 2: Thanks for the gold fellow human.
I think, that ultimately, this is the *wrong* call.
This, to me, sounds like slamming your dick in a car door twice, just to make sure it really did hurt the first time.
If you want to help Syrians, do it in Syria. You don't clean up shit by smearing it all over your self.
Battered wife syndrome
Yeah, this won't bite you in the arse or anything.
Shouldn't the headline read "France rejects common sense, takes in more refugees"?
Most people seem to only think 1 step ahead.

So lets say the terrorists that hit Paris were not Refugees, okay. They were home grown and raised in europe by their religious parents, who in turn migrated earlier to europe.

So, what's to stop the next generation to do the same thing? Studies show that these people do not share our core values, they are much more religious than we are. Increasing their population is only going to make it easier for them not to assimilate, they will hold on to their culture which could very well result in more home grown terrorists using an ancient book to excuse horrific acts of violence.
I'm glad Reddit doesn't control policy anywhere in these countries, because based on everything I've read, you people are bound and determined to let the fuckers waltz right in unopposed. Isn't it humanitarian to protect the citizens of these "host" nations?
Fear evolved as a survival mechanism. Rejecting fear is equivalent to rejecting hunger and thirst.
Liberals are too PC to reject them. When Sharia law is put in place Liberal ideology will be the first banned. A little ironic  
France really hates everything.  Including and especially France.  
Literally killing themselves. Time to leave Europe.
[deleted]
When France becomes a majority Muslim country, will it still be France? 
I'm sure women will get a taste of that "multi-culturalism" very soon.
As a french it seems obvious to me that since we took the risk to destabilize syria or lybia we have a moral obligation to take in the refugees even though unemployment rates are at a all time high. The intelligent thing to do would have been to avoid this situation in the first place though ...
Annnd...this is why they'll be bombed again.
Heh, good luck trying to "incorporate" 30,000 of people that have no interest of understanding your culture and can't even speak basic french. Not to mention that among 30,000 there most definitely is a few extremists to say the least.
France rejects ~~*fear*~~ **logic**, renews commitment to take in 30,000 Syrian refugees
This is the future you all chose.
And in 8-12 months we will have another incident like Charlie Hebdo or the Paris Attacks.
France will not allow people with legit concerns to voice their options about being displaced by people that don't share their values in their own land.
Because that would be racist.....
The problem isn't taking in refugees, it's taking in refugees with forged papers who you don't know anything about. This is why the best method is to work with aid groups on the ground in the troubled area who can pinpoint genuinely deserving people and groups.
inb4 france bombed again.
France is dumb as fuck. It doesn't matter how many innocent migrants there are, there are still extremists who want to end western civilization. Why the hell would anyone take that chance is beyond me...
I was wondering if someone could tell me how much the recent incidents could affect me wanting to study abroad for a PhD. I am an Egyptian Muslim. 
Man I'm glad we only share borders with Mexico and Canada.  Hella nice neighbors.
Donc très irresponsable
This upcoming election for Hollande could be a blood bath Nikolas Sarkozy leads him by 10% in a runoff election and Alain Juppé leads him by 21% in a head to head runoff.
Moderate Islam speaks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STmanv1ICkk
What a stupid title, totally biased.
30 000 is like nothing for a country like France. Look at what Germany and Sweden are doing.
fool me once, shame on you
fool me twice...

remind me, france, how does the rest of that go?
Say it loud say it clear NWO &amp; terror are welcome here
Reject fear you say? interesting.  And the new crackdown in civil liberties/encryption begins in 3...2...1
"Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it."
Damned fools.
Silly, romantic, stupid French.

Take in the religious minorities facing death like Christians and Yazidi. Take in women fleeing honor killings or FGM. Take in young children who aren't indoctrinated.

Let the cowardly men stay.
But what do the French voters want?
And two months from now...BOOM. It's not that they are stupid. It's intentional, done to destroy their society. 
How does one reject their sympathetic nervous system?

"Sometimes fear is the appropriate response."  
"France Rejects Fear" - Way to editorialize in the title there. I wonder what OP thinks about this? You've tainted the entire discussion by interjecting that little quip.
France or France's leaders? There's an enormous divide between what the people want and what the people are being forcefully subjected to these days.

Either way, Europe is fucking doomed.
The problems in Syria were caused by Syrians. You import third world people and you import third world problems. 
Bad idea. I'm thankful I live in rural Canada.
With proper screening, why not? Prove to ISIS that their terror is not sufficient to change our world. Western values rule the civilized world, and we do not negotiate with terrorists.
Holy shit, Europe is gonna become terrible, uncivilized and unsafe by the 2020s if this keeps up

Absolutely unbelievable how PC culture can cause the downfall of an entire continent so quickly

p.s. if there are 25 M&amp;Ms on the table, and just 2 of them are poisoned, how many would YOU eat?
I really think we continue the refugee intake but it's worrying that the more we let in the more of a stranglehold Islam has on Europe. With how many kids they have we'll be looking at a ridiculous number of Europeans being Muslims. This isn't an issue until you realise that a really surprsingly high number of Euro Muslims sympathise with ISIS, a high % want sharia law imposed and the women are still not allowed to live a full life free of control from their husbands.
How many more attacks until France awakens I wonder
This is all great, but the true problem is ISLAM.   
Stupid.
I am all for helping refugees, but it's important to remind refugees that by letting them into the western world we are providing them with a gift of freedom and that immigration implies that they should and must put their new 'home' above all, including their religion, their old country, and their culture. Unfortunately, I don't think too many immigrants/refugees really accept the new country as their 'home' and that's not fair to countries like Germany, France, and others that are opening their doors at the risk of letting in potential terrorists.  If you are not going to stand up for the hand that saved you then you should not be holding on to it. 
There is brave and then there is stupid....
France Welcomes Death, Renews Commitment To Take In 30,000 Syrian Refugees
&gt;France rejects logic and common sense.
To  be clear, none of the 5 Paris attackers identified so far is Syrian. [Source](https://twitter.com/ABarnardNYT/status/666987273536278531)
There is no hope for Europe then.
Hahha thinkprogress.org? A highschool newspaper is more credible
This whole refugee situation is a mess to begin with. 

You can't say no to them because they either die in front of your border or uncontrollable break through it. 

You don't want to say yes because terrorists are going to enter.

 And you can't say yes to only the ones that are good people because how the fuck do you want to differentiate between them. It's not like terrorists carry a sign with them with a big arrow pointing to their face. 


People point out that none of the attackers were refugees. The problem is that having unemployed Muslim men in your country is a breeding ground for recruits to these sorts of things. It's the next generation that is the concern.
The only smart country in Europe is Hungary. Being at the front door of Europe, they defended against the Mongols and the Turks. Now they are once again under siege but standing firm. When leaders are more concerned with the country's reputation than the security of its people, Terrorists will take advantage.
Great idea!

According to liberals, it's /impossible/ that terrorists also come into the country when you let in refugees. If you think that terrorists can follow and blend in with refugees, then you're a racist!
Gee I wonder how that's going to turn out....
I have a solution: Europe and America take a vote, and every liberal that votes to take in refugees is allowed to house a family. The liberals pay for their clothing, food, shelter, education and all their expenses. If the refugees commit any crime, the liberals get prosecuted just like the refugees that committed the crime did. This will show the liberals they can put their money where their mouth is, so to speak. 
French citizens don't choose.  No average citizen of europe chose this.
France is taking 30,000 refugees in after their attacks and here I am sitting in Massachusetts with my governor saying how a couple thousand of refugees are not welcome here because of security concerns.
tfw you live in spain with 40%+ youth unemployment and americans are telling you that you're racist and fascist for not wanting to accept EU mandated thousands of economic migrants per month in your country that is quickly becoming a failed state itself

i am university educated in a quantitative field, fluent in three languages, speak four, and i cannot find a job in my beloved country. yet we must take care of, re-educate, and employ thousands of new people every month. i am angry, and rightly so.
Considering what Putin just came out with. Litterally 'I will send them all to god and he can sort them out', I wouldn't want to be anywhere near syria either. 
Its better to give handouts to anybody who wants it, rather than seem racist to a bunch of SJWs. These people will never leave, they will stay in europe forever. You don't become a rich 1st world nation by letting in this many from the 3rd world. Wheres the benefit? Oh yeah, morals &gt; rationality.
It’s a bold move Cotton, let’s see if it pays off   
   
I'm expecting a repeat of:   
13 Nov attacks  
21 aug attempted attack  
26 June Beheading  
8 Jan Attacks  
    
   
At this point France cares more about refugees than the safety of their own citizens. 


Le Pen just won the election. 
This misses the bigger issue, which is France's (and Europe's) legal immigration policy.  France had a much smaller problem with Islamists when its Muslim population was 4%.  It is now 8%.


Does anyone want to venture a guess as to how things will turn out when it's 15%?  30%?  &gt;50%?  Please explain your answer.


My answer:  They can "reject fear" all they want, but the indefinite mass immigration of Muslims into Europe is turning it into the Middle East.  This doesn't even have much to do with the current refugee/migrant crisis; this has been their policy for decades.
man y'all are hopeless
Title should read "France rejects the notion of a rake, boldly steps on it again"
You may have America's share.  Vivia  la France.
What a shitty fucking title.  
  
EDIT: Oh, now I see the source. That explains it.
le idiots.
What a bullshit title. France rejects caution, invites 30,000 migrants from the middle east without background checks.
OK ,
 just don't reject common sense also.
Is that a good idea when 8 people were able to kill over 120 people? I understand it's more than possible that none of them will be terrorists, but there's always a chance and that's your native peoples lives you're gambling with. 

How do people from France feel about this?
Only in the sick mind of a liberal would this be a good idea.
People, especially liberals are pretty dumb.
Also taking in 100K people does basically nothing when you consider how many people exist. The 1st world countries are destroying themselves, while having little impact currently and long term negative impact.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE
France: stop being crazy here
I feel like there is a great deal of astroturfing occurring in this thread.  

The general mood of Reddit and I would say most people is that hordes unknown people pouring into Europe is neither desirable nor safe.  Doesn't matter if the latest terrorists weren't refugees - the refugees are still a recruitment resource and camouflage for terrorist actors.  

And as we've seen, it's not just first wave refugees you have to worry about - it's the indoctrinated second or third generation.
What is the left's end goal with all of this?
I read this title as "France Rejects Fear, Renews Stupidity".
France rejects citizens, raises chances of further attacks.
Why isn't Japan's immigration policy denounced as fearful? Why, after decades of mass immigration, does reducing or even halting immigration from just one country, or the resettlement of refugees with a credible threat of infiltration, have to be denounced as phobic? This is why the Far-right is making gains, the politicians in power aren't the ones living in the neighbourhoods radically transformed by their policies.
Not all muslims are a threat but some are.  Guess which ones.  If you are wrong once hundreds may die, maybe more.  Does that sound like a sensible bet. 
Meanwhile in the Netherlands, that is 25 times smaller then France, takes 8000 refugees a month...
Good for them.  The only way to defeat inhumanity is with humanity.  
France has not rejected the fear. Some asshole at the top of the tree who in unaffected by whatever happens in the World renews his commitment because he is afraid of losing power. If he is really serious then he should commit to taking only one Syrian refugee into his residence then others will take him seriously and follow suit....
RIP France............................
**THIS WORLD IS TOO PC BRO**
The violence that occurred in Paris is just a shadow of what is happening in Syria.  I think perhaps that it has encouraged some sympathy.
Sure why not?  I mean things are going so well over there.  Absolutely no racial tension and definitely no radical muslims blowing up buildings and killing people.
Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on France.
They can have Canada's as well if they like. Id rather the terror be in France than Canada.
France just wasted one of the best opportunities to get rid of these guys. I'm sure after the events no one would have been upset if France opted out of taking in migrants.
This title is biased and manipulative. Acknowledging and assessing a very real danger for current and future generations is the correct thing to do. Political correctness is fear based, it makes people fear that they will be labeled as a bigot or racist. I look at the situation observe that 100% of the people committing these atrocities are unfortunately of the Islamic faith and, if given the choice, I reserve the right to carefully judge those that have subscribed to the Islamic faith because of what their brother's and sisters have done. I do not care about ethnicity, race, religion or anything that might make a person different; but when I see all of this coming from the Islamic faith - regardless of good or bad intentions of these refugees, I feel that I do not want this culture in my homeland. I do not want to poison the culture in which I live with such a potentially hateful and lethal ideology. Fortunately we do have a very accepting and protecting nature BUT this also is a huge weakness. Its like an "aid" item in Fallout that has awesome HP but also significant RAD damage... I usually pass on those items and sell them because it isn't worth the damage.  These are tough times my friends, and decisions must be rooted in logic. I hope that we can resolve the refugee situation to some extent... what ever happens will not be perfect. Because there will be another attack be it in the U.S or the world, the refugee conversation will be revisited and blame will go around until someone has a knee jerk reaction and does too little too late.  Personally, I want to save everyone on those boats. Its horrible what is happening to these people, and these poor kids. The kids caught up in this is what breaks my heart.
I'll end with one last observation, that is the proverbial nail in my seemingly bigoted coffin: I am a social worker in a very large city with a big Muslim population. I work very closely with the poor and the homeless in the mental health field. I am connected to every social program that exists in our large and growing community and there is not one Islam/Muslim based community aid program. Not one.
France rejects caution*
What a slap in the face to the people of France.
I am deeply disturbed by the terrorist attacks in Paris. I absolutely hate ISIS, al Qaeda, the Taliban and every other form of terrorism and radical Islam.
I am a Soldier in the Army. Over the past decade I have served in two wars. I have lost numerous friends in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan. I lost my cousin in the World Trade Center on 9/11. Over the past decade, I have dedicated my adult life to protecting our great nation and I believe that we need to do everything we can to keep our nation safe.

We definitely accept these refugees. The United States’ actions have contributed to the current crisis in the Middle East. It is our civic duty to humanity to support these refugees.

I admit that there are risks associated with accepting these refugees. After all, at least one of the recent alleged terrorist in Paris was a Syrian refugee, but we should not forget that most of the terrorist were French or European citizens. Remember also that, all of the terrorist during the Charlie Hebdo attack were French citizens. You must realize that xenophobic rhetoric and actions will only breed more homegrown terrorists. 

We cannot follow down the path of the dark side. For these reasons, I not only encourage the acceptance of refugees, but I also would volunteer to house a refugee. If able, I would hope that I could show a refugee or their family such overwhelming care and support that they would fully and rapidly integrate into American society and become contributing members of our community.

In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” Thank you for this article.
Who would have thought that France is the only country not surrendering to terrorism.
Slow learners. 
"France rejects common sense" would be a more appropriate title. We're doing the same in Norway, importing terrorists-to-be by the thousands.
This is why France has my support and admiration. They realize to close their doors to people in need would truly let these pieces of shit in Isis win. 
Idiots
If only we had a seasonally appropriate story of middle eastern people seeking refuge and being turned away by the heartless.....
Are mid east countries taking in refugees?
Seems like "refugees" are the new "dreamers".  You just call them something else, sprinkle it with fairy dusty and rainbow smiles, and all will be good... 

If, per top post, this article was BEFORE the attack then it is pointless and even misleading to be posting this. 
So when is the Muslims world going to "reject fear"?

http://countercurrentnews.com/2015/11/saudi-arabia-has-100000-empty-tents-with-ac-for-but-police-wont-let-in-a-single-refugee/
The most important thing now is the safety. No one can say refugees are 100% safe. even one ISIS member in these refugees can make huge destruction and the Paris attack shows Intelligence agency cannot perfectly detect. I think people should make decision based on reality not just feelings.
Very good
It only takes a few out of the 30,000 that they are going to bring in to be terrorists to mow down people. It's like when you touch a burning hot stove and it burns you. Hopefully you learn not to touch a hot stove again. Not decide to just go "hmm... maybe it'll be different this time!"
Are the Gulf Arab states going to 'reject fear' and take on some refugees? Just curious.
I don't think many people are opposed to helping refugees. I think people just want more vetting to ensure they are indeed refugees and not migrants taking advantage of the situation and/or terrorists. 
Honest question. Why is the international community not pushing China to take people in? They have literally empty cities. So housing would not be an issue at all.
France and Germany can afford to take in many migrants this year due to previously having some of the lowest net immigration rates amongst the major developed countries. (though not as low as Japan)

#**LIBERTÉ, ÉGALITÉ, FRATERNITÉ**
&gt; Take In 30,000 Syrian Refugees

Also known as 'half a weeks worth of Germany'
There's still the unanswered question of why the other Gulf States aren't taking in any refugees. Saudi Arabia, Oman, UAE, Kuwait...they're doing nothing. 
If there is proper vetting and checks and transportation channels for it, and those who followed the law and procedure are granted, then of course! no issues in helping people in dire need
So it's either let them in and risk another ISIS retaliation (something that would probably happen anyway) or leave them to suffer at the hands of ruthless thugs, I think France made the best decision they could. 
If there's a burgler in your home you want that person out.  You don't abandon your home.  You call for help and the police haul the guy away (or chase him out, whatever)

For some reason this never scales up.  When there's an occupying force in a country we relocate the decent people and abandon the area to slide further into chaos.  

Why do we not work on a solution that lets the Sirian people keep their homes and rebuild?

We'll fly a few sorties and go to the UN and make some speeches, but ultimately we will leave Siria in the hands of Daesh.  We'll mostly sit back and let Russia do the heavy lifting, and the missions the US would have flown we will let France take on because they want to settle a score.

But they still don't allow u to wear hijabs..life is hell in France for a Muslim.
I understand the fear people have here in the states--but I don't think it should get in the way of doing what is arguably the most humane thing to do. We must certainly be cautious about those we take in but I don't think there is any reason to believe we won't. Our own citizens have caused more bloodshed post 9/11 than any attempted terrorist (and we have had hundreds of thousands of people immigrate since then).  This is a global issue and we must all do our part to help. The answer isn't to shut our doors and use our fear as a shield. Hats off to France for not giving the terrorists what they want. 
Glad to see they've stopped having such irrational, unjustified fears! 
Thanks for the editorialized title.
And yet a majority of US states will not. I think we have officially given up any claim to being brave. Giving into blind fear and turning away human beings in need who are trying to escape a common enemy is pathetic. My state's governor is one of the majority who will turn refugees away and while he is now a well-known abomination of a man, I'm more embarrassed by him now than ever before.
I'm so shocked that so many Americans give a fuck. And by give a fuck I mean are concerned that refugees will literally tangibly affect them in any way
Although I'm very much in support of taking in refugees, that is a *bit* of a biased title to be honest.
I'm glad to see France rejecting fear and hatred. ISIS has acknowledged their key strategy is to engender fear and racial vilification in order to drive young Muslims into their arms, to bolster their ranks of cannon fodder. They also want to encourage people to turn on each other and commit similar acts of terrorism so they can claim credit/responsibility and act as though they are a well-coordinated organisation and much stronger than they actually are. 

So - I'm just going to leave this here... http://imgur.com/5btLb57
Article is premature, we will see who the French people reject in the upcoming regional elections. 
30000? Wow what a commitment!
I live in Munich, that is the number that came here one day. About 1000000 now in Germany, about 2000000 that we take in total approx.
It isn't merely rejecting fear, as in some non-rational emotion. ISIS explicitly claimed they were smuggling people into Europe through the refugee crisis, and Greece has found weapons catches being smuggled in under the guise of refugee aid that likely came from ISIS as well. As such, in some respect they are rejecting some very rational hesitation and concern by renewing this commitment.

I am of the view that almost always in matters of geopolitics, family, greater humanity and so forth, there are not perfect solutions or ideal solutions. Unfortunately, though this decision to renew is through good intentions, this really may result or highly contribute to another major terror attack. Sucks for everyone involved because it does seem the path to hell sometimes is actually paved with good intentions.

What a mess this has turned into... I still am unable to say no to a refugee. The word refugee means something to me, I can only imagine what the children are going through. 

I guess I have no fear...  

edit: Is there something one could actively do to help?
Where did the notion of "terrorists want you to be afraid and want you to give up freedom for security"  come from?  All I've seen is terrorists just want you/us dead...
I would agree that they probably do have the ability to screen and identify most would-be terrorists from the Syrian immigrants, but that's not the only threat. Immigrants don't have to be terrorists to do irreparable damage a country. Its culture, values and traditions can also be destroyed as a result of unbalanced immigration practices. 

The French people are already in the midst of a deep and religiously-based battle over [female subjugation and the burqa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_ban_on_face_covering). Similarly, I'm pretty sure that British people did not have **["this"](https://youtu.be/SgKMI1wV0ps?t=467)** in mind when they agreed to bring in large groups of Islamic people.

It's not just the threat of bombs that they should consider, it's the threat of their cultural expectations that will present the most significant challenges.  
I think it's important to recognize the differences in how refugees are handled in the US and EU currently.

In the US, the vetting process takes at least 18 months, and involves checks by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, and another counter-terrorism unit, plus in-person interviews and story verification. IIRC, the US has taken in &lt; 2,000 Syrian refugees so far, with the Obama administration willing to take up to 10,000 more. This is a controlled intake, and as far as I know, none of the major liberal figures have suggested eliminating or reducing screening procedures.

In the EU, there's hundreds of thousands of immigrants pouring across the Mediterranean Sea and Turkey into the mainland. I can't imagine there's the time or the resources to screen that many people beyond basic checks. So, this is not a controlled intake, and therefore would be much, much easier for Daesh to exploit.

Two very different situations, which I think is something we need to keep in mind when having these conversations.
Sacre bleu!
Okay since this thread is relevant I need an educated persons help PLEASE.

Someone today made a bold claim that the majority of civilians in Raqqa support ISIS. What are your opinions? Thanks for any replies.
Yeah... good luck with that
thats a bold move cotton
I hope you people have plenty of alcohol
Better check refugees very carefully. By all means take in refugees, but not making sure who is coming in is madness and irresponsible to your citizens.
hollande impeached in 3...2...1
I'll never look at france the same way ever again....
I can only hope Hollande has some sense to regulate these refugees heavily upon entry. France's position makes such regulation possible and Hollande's views ensure he won't act on racist urges. If he doesn't, there is the very real fear that France will elect a far-right government, bringing the cold, dark, and disgusting power of fascism back into Europe. And I have no doubt in my mind that, history in France be damned, they will use any means necessary, be it just or not, to enact their cruel agenda.
That is not rejecting fear, that is injecting fear mostly to the negative experiences of the native population. 
enjoy the extra dead french. Fucking morons. 
Stupid is as stupid does.
incompétent
France obviously can't take a hint... Oh well, fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.
Can't fix stupid
If I'm reading this correctly,  this is an internal thing to the Muslim community, not a government edict. This is similar to what other religions do - I can't go out, get a black shirt and white collar, and call myself a Catholic priest; I have to be ordained (approved) by the religion's ruling body and uphold the teachings they pass down. 

If there are not legal repercussions, I'm all for this. It sounds like the Muslim community is standing up and officially saying "these people are not with us, what they're preaching is not Islam."
Didn't this horribly backfire when they tried something similar with the Catholic Church during the French Revolution?
It's a good idea in principle but they will simply preach without such a license
Well it's a start. It's cool that this is an initiative started by Muslims, so radicals can't claim that France is trying to subvert their religion. 

Edit: Holy fuck read the article you shitbirds, the CFCM is not part of the French government.
I mean, this is pretty similar to how churches work in America, at least for Methodists (which is what I was raised as). There's a governing body that tells ministers where to go, people they report to and whatnot. It's decentralized but they have a code of conduct, and people that do stuff deemed unacceptable can be defrocked. 

This is a really good system and I approve of it. Hopefully this will be adopted on a wide scale, and hopefully it will be *peaceful*. 
Some people here thinks it's something new and never done before but it's already done in many muslim countries.
A very pleasant and constructive proposal by them :)
As a sunni muslim, I actually agree with this practice. We see the shia muslims already do this. I have never met any shia imams who weren’t educated, intelligent and articulate and that is because in order to lead prayer and deliver kutbas the shia require strict education requirements for religious education as well as a regular formal schooling. Every shia imam follows sermons with questions and answers and will openly discuss religious matters. Same can’t be said of their sunni counterparts. In many impoverished countries, mainly sunni, they do not have stringent rules about who is allowed to lead prayer and just about anybody can grow a beard and claim religious leadership. 
There is no way to enforce that, and no way to make sure that the government isn't in the business of saying that is religious "Truth" and what isn't.
We have this system in Oman.
They dont? That's haram they need to be an educated person  in the matter of religion before being an imam 
It's amusing because if any non-Muslim suggested such a thing they would be called a nazi.

Actually, I'm all for this, if there is one thing that will actually stop hatred of Islam it's seeing Muslims clean house from within. A lot of the mistrust comes from the fact that too many people seem to be making nothing but excuses for why Muslims don't need to change anything. Seeing them say "Yes we do" is a hell of a lot more reassuring.
ITT: the same people that call on moderate muslims to police their faith and handle the extremists saying that this call by moderate muslims to do something about the spread of hate within their religion is "unenforceable" and a waste of time.

Make up your minds. 
Reddit supports hate speech bans in France, but loathes hate speech bans in the US. Interesting double standard.
This may be an unpopular opinion, but I believe requiring a permit to preach religion is massively overstepping the bounds between government and church.  This measure would very clearly be a form of religious oppression - I understand why the Muslims would want this manner of policing, and I agree that imams shouldn't be preaching hate and promoting jihadism, but requiring permits to preach is not the correct solution.  "Approved imams" would most likely generate a great deal of backlash.  Could you imagine the newspaper headlines? "French Imam Arrested for Preaching Islam Without Permit"?

At best, these permits should be voluntary - not required to preach as an imam.  This would at the very least help promote a more tolerate view of Islam and help the muslim community migrate to non-jihadist places of worship.  I personally don't believe these permits should exist in any capacity, but I understand why the call for them has been made.
How about they just point at him and laugh?  "He's not really a Muslim.  He's a drama queen, a power whore.  For him the religion is about getting people to do what *he* wants, not what God wills."
I don't have a problem with registration of influential religious community leaders as such... but the license needs to be free and very easy to obtain.

It should only be used to track those who promote violence and hate speech to make it more difficult to operate a house of worship, not to control what values of their religion they preach.

"Tolerant and open Islam" is not an acceptable standard.  "Not ordering murder" is acceptable.
"tolerant and open Islam" = Islam without Mohammed and Quran?
I don't see it stopping anything. Radicals could just meet in a living room or basement, making them harder to observe. It would give the further license to feel oppressed by wicked Western ways. Which then brings people to curtailing right to assembly laws...and it all goes pear shaped.
These certified Imams will be considered apostates and targets for ISIS.
Certainly doesn't sound like any of the problems Christianity had in the Bible...

Oh wait... nvm
Turkey already does something like this. [Presidency of Religious Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Religious_Affairs)

In Germany it's the [Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish-Islamic_Union_for_Religious_Affairs)


This is the kind of thing that needs to spread.
The decentralised structure of Islam it is true leads to certain abuses, but you could say the same about certain forms of protestantism (tv evangelists). It is ironic that it is the organised, bureaucratised  religions that have oversight over forms of extremism and preach more tolerance in the world. 
What's the point when at least one of the Paris attackers (perhaps all of them) never even went to a mosque?
That could actually work. I think a lot of the protestant denominations in the US mandate that their pastors be ordained/certified and go through a fairly rigorous screening/vetting process. 
Nobody expects the French Muslim inquisition.
Isn't that like requiring a license to speak in public? I mean , if they want to act like a Union and support establishments that only hire licensed preachers then maybe fine. But requiring, by law, that people should get a license to essentially speak in public can be dangerous.
The people preaching violence and the individuals who attend DO NOT participate in regular Islamic gatherings. They meet in secret away from the normal community in hidden places. Every time we learn about some "radical" we inevitably find out they they were not regular members of their community. Seems the *best* way to "target" radicals is to simply follow how often the attend prayer. This is a pointless endeavor, there isn't a single mosque in the world that would hire a Imam without qualification. In Islam the duty of Imam is taken so seriously that people will *hesitate* to take that job for fear of misleading the people.
Bad, bad, bad idea. Jesus Christ this is a bad idea.
People bringing up the 1st amendment have not read the article. 

Even if it France had something 100% identical with the American 1st amendment, it would not be relevant to this story.
This is the main difference between Islam and  most other organised religions (other than US independent Christian churches). There is a hierarchy to the clergy, monks etc that ensure a consistent message from top to bottom (good or bad). 

Islam has no real control over preachers in Mosques, anyone that can get people to listen is a accepted and there is no real control over what happens in the religion.  
Sounds like a good thing to not let somebody tell crowds of people to kill those who insult their religion.
That will fix everything. Ok, lets go home now.
Fantastic idea
ITT: massive amounts of evidence that people not only don't bother reading the article, but they can't even be bothered to fully digest the title of the post anymore. 
What a horrible idea.  Forcing people to get a license to preach religion is ridiculous...
"Tuesday for imams" is admittedly a pretty soft name.
That's an excellent idea.  Other countries should do the same. 
That's honestly fucked up. The state should not have the power to allow or disallow people from preaching or similar. I say this as an atheist, because like, that sets a *hella* dangerous precedent. 
*sigh* God damn it, Trump you can't just put on a burqa and do something like that
After decades of spreading poison they're finally feeling the waking French breathing down in their necks.
As much as I don't like Islam this goes against freedom of speech if I'm understanding right. 
If your religion is so fucked you need a license to "prove"  you are a good person, it should make you reconsider that religion. 
pull over sir.

do *you* have a license for driving that point home?
That is ridiculously impractical.
Not sure how effective this will be, but is a good first step. Only muslims can put an end to radical muslims. All the rest of us can do is contain it.
How can you ever prove, though, that any fanatic from any religion isnt just going to lie when being issued something like this? For example, this one time, I pretended to be interested in girl guides. I even said the whole chant with everyone, just to participate once to do the free activity. I never cared, really. 
I think anything Muslim's are required to do should also be brought in for any other faith group. I don't like the idea of a double standard.

That said given we require teaches have some form of qualification I don't think it's a very radical idea in some senses. Religious leaders can play an equal part in shaping a persons view, they should probably be required to complete some form of certification before hand.

God help us if it's like a driving license though, the amount of pointless bureaucracy involved in that process and shoddiness of the actual tests is dire. How someone can be considered fit to drive anywhere BASICALLY FOREVER and not required to drive demonstrate they can drive on the motorway is bloody stupid.
Cool, can we get those for Baptists in rural areas of the U.S.? Thanks in advance.
I understand the sentiment but forcing someone to preach what you think is acceptable is wrong and a violation of their rights. Everyone talking about how letting the NSA and the TSA invade our lives is letting the terrorists win by handing over our freedoms in exchange for some security should be even more livid about this. Let's not sacrifice our free speech in exchange for absolutely nothing measurable other than the feeling that we did something.
I am shocked and disappointed that all of the commenters above me agree with this. There is no place in the world where you should need a license to talk about something. I mean there is definitely a way to stop terrorism, but this is absolutely not it. 
Bigots:"why aren't the muslim leaders doing anything about radical Muslims"

Muslims leaders:"here guys, you are required to get a certificate to preach."

Bigots:"omg, that won't even work. What kind of shit is that". 

So first, it's why aren't they doing anything, next when hey are TRYING to clean up the mess, it's not "going to work". 
Islam is a religion of people. It has no hierarchy or clergy structure. Regulating Islam isn't going to work. I'm afraid what will work isn't being discussed. People are afraid to even suggest real solution because it doesn't fit with the narrative that "Islam is evil". You can put up all the knee jerk reaction and polities and ban on refugees and immigrants but you are just putting bad aid on a massive wound. I'm sad for everyone involved.
So they're calling for a registry of all Imams? Other countries flip sh*t over this. 
I'm incredibly happy that Muslims are advocating for this. Also, if France doesn't pass this (which they probably won't), they should try starting a Muslim organization that gives out certificates to religiously tolerant Mosques. 
Screw that, if other religions aren't requiring it, they shouldn't require it.
It's irrelevant if they're restricted purely to promoting and spouting what's inside of the Quran only, as the material there is exactly what's causing these problems;

-Quran:2:193: "Fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief) and religion is only for Allah."

-Quran 8:12: "Instill terror into the hearts of the unbelievers;" 

-Quran 2:191: "... kill the disbelievers wherever we find them …" 

-Quran 8:7: "Allah wished to confirm the truth by His words: 'Wipe the infidels out to the last.'" 

-Quran 8:12: "Your Lord inspired the angels with the message: 'I will terrorize the unbelievers. Therefore smite them on their necks and every joint and incapacitate them. Strike off their heads and cut off each of their fingers and toes.'" 

But we will be so much better off now, now that they can only recite those kinds of passages from within the Quran, and not whatever they can concoct in their brains.

/s
Owch, I know that times might seem hard, right now, but this directly violates one of the [Four Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms) principle, that is: the freedom of religion.

Trying to stop religion (even an extreme one) by regulating the right for its leaders to express themselves is just another form of censorship in disguise. There are more ethical and effective methods (in the long run) to fight against extremism than by censoring their leaders.

Censorship of their leaders will naturally lead to a revolt: the common reaction among fellow leaders will be to denounce this censorship and call out the political leaders as enemies of their religion.

Nothing good can come out of censorship, no matter its form.
so west is the bastion of freedom of speech eh? 

so much now you need a licence to talk. 
Terrible idea. 

People should have the freedom to preach whatever they want. The crime doesn't happen until someone throws a punch, pulls a trigger, or sets off a bomb.
Even as someone who doesn't like religion, I think this is wrong. Letting someone decide what is and isn't the correct way to interpret a religion is insane.
It's a short little article, but I think it just might work. I guess we will have to wait and find out. Anyone have any more details regarding the certification process? maybe some of the questions they might be asking when distributing such a "license?"
yeah you know that certificate: teaches and preaches outside the qur'an
[deleted]
"Tolerant and open" is a subjective term.

In the Middle-East, that type of preaching is the norm. In the West, it completely goes against our set of values. 
I believe Egypt has a similar system, which was set up to stop radicalism from spreading. It's a free speech violation, but it could make France safer.
This makes me very uncomfortable. 
I'll get the popcorn.
[deleted]
This is kind of a slippery slope, but I would definitely be in favor of a worldwide ban on ISIS or terrorism support.
I have a driving license and I still speed.
Good, I prefer somewhat unrestricted speech to free speech if free speech means letting violent ideologies prosper unrestricted. This is the more realistic answer to the Islam question, not BOO GO HOME, GATE THE BORDERS.
This is pressing into a weird, uncomfortable middle ground between freedom of speech and religion and civil defense. France is already pretty secular though.
Why can't we preach Christianity then?
...and of course, if a non-muslim said that, SJWs would call them racist.
This seems like something that would be best done inside the church. Do Muslims not have a religious leader like other religions? 
The Imams that are popular in their community will preach license or not.
Then they better stop preaching from the Quran. 

This shit is just not gonna work, guys. You need a new prophet.
France has been looking for a while into implementing the Moroccan style imam trainings. http://www.france24.com/en/20150920-france-imams-receive-tolerance-training-morocco-islam-religion
the rest of the world sure as fuck can't convince them - maybe their own damn people can???
Yep, because nobody with a driving license ever broke the law!
It's nice people are starting to "get woke" about what islam really is. 

&gt; **Sample Imam Certification Exam**
&gt;
&gt; * Are you going to preach and support suicide bombing?
&gt;    * a. Yes
&gt;    * b. No

Terror-supporting Imam answers (b), and still preaches bad-shit crazy stuff.  
How are they going to prevent that?
Hey, they beat Trump to it!
They are trying to fight jihidist propaganda when in fact they are creating it
Everyone calls out for religious reform, but when an idea is presented it is immediately shot down.
So they what if we give all the Muslims a certificate, like a drivers license, but they have to display it on their clothing. So we know they're the nice kind of Muslim. 

Cause that's never backfired before. 
I kind of feel like any religious leader should be subject to licensing and what-have-you. 
This is a really bad idea and is going the wrong way here. France needs to promote an open society if they are to show that they are different from ISIS. What they are doing here can be used as a recruitment tool and will further isolate their Islamic community. 
As a legal analyst,  I once saw a signed  certificate by a Muslim pledging to Islam,  so it must mean something to them.
Hahaha yes, what France needs is an Ayatollah, that can keep order amongst the French people
What could go wrong?
What does the Geneva convention say about such a law? Well emperor Constantine did the same thing in Rome to keep the Christians terrorists on a leash.
This would work best if the punishment for disobedience was summery execution. Otherwise, one can only expect things to go dark and nasty.
Who is this Tuesday and why was this person called?
If imams who had nefarious intentions re preaching somehow obtained a license and abused it, then the penalties should also encompass their friends and family.

Some are more willing to sacrifice themselves than those they care about.
Fuck that. 
in middle east the imams are government employees mainly, so its good cuz its always positive talk and quick, family is waiting to enjoy the weekend! 
Heh, make them give trigger warnings as well. Let us all be intolerant of potential discomfort of ideas. Making someone uncomfortable is a thought crime!
This is so stupid. What's going to stop them from, I don't know, LYING? Terrorist recruiters should be prosecuted.
ORDER! VE MUST HAFF ORDER IN EUROPE!
A simple statement accepting the separation of church and state is all that is required, Religion deals with spiritual issues and the the state deals with temporal issues , and they can have a dialogue when some temporal matters deal with moral problems but in the end the final call for how a country is run is not something religions should have anything to do with.
This is what Singapore did. An Islamic body set up by the government to scrutinise, observe and hand out friday sermons scripts vetted out to make sure no hate and extremist, jihadist agenda being voiced out to the masses. Imam must be certified to carry it out.. Scholars and religious teachers must be from a known islamic university like al-azhar. 

everything is controlled to make sure no crazy jihadist tries to manipulate.
Any thing like this is a step in the right direction. It needs to be done in the USA as well. Unfortunately Muslims have lost the trust of normal citizens worldwide and steps like this are necessary.     
They wouldn't have the legitimacy of any sort of a single mosque in the government at that time, however.
Liberty, equality, brotherhood?
As an atheist, I don't like the idea of prior restraint.

Better to prosecute people for actually advocating violence or jihad.

And those who do should also be civilly liable for violence committed by people who have listened to their exhortations.
And how will this effect the various sects of Islam? 
I don't know whether I agree with the policy or not - I haven't really had time to think through the implications of it - but it's heartening to see French Muslim leaders taking responsibility for their religion. Moderate reform from within is something Islam is in desperate need of.
oh what an ignorant and naive mistake this will be, this is what happens when you try to fix a problem BEFORE  you truly acknowledged her.
They could stop them from preaching, which would be harder for them has been taken imo.
This would be great
Is Trump president there?
tolerant and open islam is a myth
Cant you just fine people for telling lie's?  I don't like the concept of a group being silenced because their speak might be "hate speak".  But I have no problem charging people a shit ton of money if they cant back up their claims.  That should also include print that is made public for the purpose of consumption.
That's nice.
Can we spread this to all religions please?
Funny enough this is actually a good idea for organized religion; they've long been plagued by various asshats that have clung heartily to the messages they preached in the recent past but are trying to PR their way past.
As a Muslim, its a good idea in theory, but I'm not so sure about centralizing power into a "religious elite".

Still, just more proof that Muslims in fact don't condone radical Islam.
While the guy recommending it compares it to a driver's license, it sounds a lot more comparable to a good rating from the BBB.

I.e., having no particular legal significance, but potentially informing consumers.
Earlier I used to kill people when I drove, but once I had my driving licence... 
What a horrible idea.  Forcing people to get a license to preach religion is ridiculous...
They meet in secret away from the main community, regardless of whether they can find another mosque to preach is not involved with this, which you would know if you do so people can call the vatican and they already do it in some senses.
.....because making a rule will stop them?
Do they have to wear a crescent-shaped patch on their clothing, yet?
The main obstacle is getting the young generation inside places like san deni  to listen. 
Those young people follow ISIS and not the leader of France muslim community (who is with a bodyguard 24/7)
Whether this helps or not remains to be seen. However, I think the chances of a positive impact on the French Muslim community are much greater if the change happens from the inside as opposed to a government mandated registration system like Donald Trump suggested.
A few times this year Westminster banned certain extreme Islam preachers flying in to give a talk.   All of these talks went ahead over skype and/or youtube.   
The same will happen in France
"tolerant islam" 

Lmao my sides! 
If ideas like this were implemented worldwide it would be a lot easier to combat extremism and it's preachers. 

The Islamic sects need to get better orginization and follow this example.
Has anyone heard of the separation of Church and State?

Everyone READ THE DAMN ARTICLE BEFORE POSTING A COMMENT!

It's not the French govt. that would be doing the licensing, it'd be this leading Muslim body.
Ah Islam, one of the most, if not, the most disgusting religion in the 21st century. Anyone remember the 200,000 Hindu women raped by Muslim men in India? Didn't think so. Because Islam attempts to cover-up it's atrocious acts as best it can.
This will never backfire.  Not at all.

Forcing people underground to practice their faith free of government intrusion will only have positive consequences.  It is like there are different flavors of Islam now.  Everyone who claims to be a Muslim is exactly the same and believes the same things!

Europe is really stupid when it comes to dealing with problematic speech.  It fights it through suppression, which never works.
As long as every other religious job involving preaching has to have one too. Because nothing says tolerance and freedom like restricting religious speech.

...Wait.
Knee jerk reaction, bloody good idea.  Long term, hang on a minute that can only end badly with underground preachers, other religions being forced into the same rules, then out of religion simply ideologies, then what? No thanks.
Yeah... no. I think they need a government outreach program of sorts to try and stay in touch with the community and prevent radicalism, but government licensing of religious leaders? That sounds like a terrible way to go.

&gt;Edit: I may have misread it. The way it was phrased it sounded like even though the religious leaders were asking for it, the government would be doing the licensing. Not sure how this would be enforced though without the government, I mean, what's to stop an imam from just ignoring this licensing process?
A bit like a driving license, really? So what. An official driving license never stopped anybody to cheat the law. Just don't get caught
So Reddit thinks Trump was right once again. Cool!
Hey, as long as they also require licenses for Catholics, Buddhists, Zoroastrians, etc. they can go to town. Seems like the licensing fees would be a nice little revenue stream too.

But when will the moderate Muslims speak out! 

The opposition of this idea, shows a lack of understanding of how Islam is regulated in such secular Muslim countries as Turkey and Islam, as well as non-Muslim countries like Singapore.

The West is already interfering with religion in Muslim countries already. The West gives government money to religious schools in such places like Indonesia to make sure they don't reach Wahhabism and teach a more tolerant form of Islam. It gives scholarships to people in developing countries to study Islam in the West.  Western taxpayer dollars are already being used to do exactly what some people are arguing can't be done in the West, because it violates the separation between religion and state.

Slippery fucking slope.
cool but reddit is still gonna say Muslims aren't doing anything to curb this problem
I dont support terrorism, but this does go against freedom of religion. I would be ok with it if they did this for all religions. That way they can do away with cults like.scientology as well.
So, a gov't instituted religious test?

LOL
Don't know what France's legal system is like, but this goes against freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly...
Regulating religious freedom has done 0 countries any good... France should know.
Can the US do that with it Xians?

How about its guns?
I don't think it should be a government enforced directive.  More or less, Muslims checking on Muslims.

Or just do what a lot of Christians do here in the US.  Mock the radical churches (i.e. [Westboro](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MOJOt1AeTlA/UQfwnAP-ulI/AAAAAAAAG6k/A3TsyOXz68s/s1600/churchsign.jpg)).
Didn't the Catholic Church go through this process through the Council of Trent?

http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Council_of_Trent.aspx

This would seem to be the more applicable analogy.
I know all the Muslim hate in Reddit but I think this is just plain wrong. I mean we're in a shitty situation but we don't do this to other religion. I guess in the midst of all this chaos this might be necessary? I don't know something. About this seems really wrong.
Sounds like a good start. At least Muslim leaders are attempting to seriously address these issues finally. I can imagine a good chunk of white Westerners will be against it though (even though it would be self-imposed by Muslims themselves).
Apply this to all religious teachers and you got yourself a stew going.
And the permit will cost money... islam on the path of becoming a cristian religion
I'm Muslim in the US and I agree with this. I have Muslim friends in Germany, England, France, Turkey, and the rest of the MENA region. When people ask me "Why are young European Muslims saying/hearing x, y, and z and you guys aren't?" although people can get radicalized anywhere (and obviously they have in the US), the national laws and oversight are vastly different and imams and scholars are held to different levels of accountability between the US and Europe. I'm flabbergasted that certain imams and clerics in the UK are not under major surveillance or in jail due to the things they say in congregation. 


let's not start restricting speech with licenses... no matter how unpleasant the speech the precedent is far more terrifying
It's a good idea and they already do it in some places but when you think about it it goes against a basic aspect of Islam, which is that nobody is in charge. Nobody can determine who's an Imam, nobody can ban people from a mosque, nobody can ex-communicate people from the religion, etc...
This sounds a lot like China 'authorizing' religion.
"You are now officially licensed in superstitious bullshit"
I don't understand this backlash. It is a good idea in principle and maybe it doesn't work. But its something. All of reddit requires Islam to go through a reformation but when someone is attempting to change part of it they immediately rain down on that idea. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. But its the attempt and the start that is needed.
Extremists aren't created in mosques, they are created on the Internet. This will do nothing.
&gt;  "Tolerant and open Islam"

It's something like "pro-choice and gay-friendly catholic church"?
Hahaha. Yeah right. Muslims are always just tacit when it comes to terrorism. They'll pretend that they fight back jihadist propaganda, but in reality, they'll just turn a being eye. This is just PR. What Muslims really want is to turn the west into a place ruled by sharia law. And they'll try to accomplish that until we finally decide that this religion should be destroyed. 
About time! I as a muslim strongly agree with this action and I wish we could have the same in every muslim country especially Pakistan and Saudi Arabia!
Let these Imams preach whatever they want.

Let the telephone company maintenance van park across the street from these Imams' houses 24/7.
Just get to the point and deport all Muslims.
Tolerant and open Islam, isn't that an oxymoron? 
tolerant and open islam is an oxymoron
There is no such thing as a tolerant and open Islam.  People have a naive tendency to equate the bible and the quran as the same thing and they are not.  The quran is not a collection of works by many authors decades after the fact that is largely believed and accepted to be allegorical.  The quran IS GODS WORDS, and YOU DO WHAT GOD TELLS YOU TO DO.  Read the damned thing, there is nothing tolerant about it.
According to info it is not the idea of the gov, but of "France's leading Muslim body".

But as much as I hate religion. I do not like this. This sounds like we would control them. Reminds me of China selecting who can be a president in HongKong. It's a vicious censorship and control. And people of the world will just have one more thing they can point to when trash talking France.
This sounds like a pretty heavy over-reach.  I think one way that this group of churches could be more effective is for them to unify under a centralized label and banner.  Having central command would mean that someone near the top could decide what is doctrine and what is not.  Thus, dissenting religious voices hold a different label.  But from what I understand this doesn't really happen in Sunni Islam.
I find this really frustrating. They should have tried to do this a very long time ago. They're 20 years late. Whenever disaster happens they're front of centre defending regular Islam; which is fine but apart from that I wonder what they've been really doing behind the scenes this entire time. Better late than never I guess.
Isn't this a direct violation of the freedom of religion in the country? 
I would rather fight ideas with ideas, not with censorship.

This proposal would infringe on the right to freedom of speech. There are many, many people saying plenty of crazy things, some of them from churches, some of them from mosques and some of them from street corners while selling pencils. The problem is that people listen to nonsense and believe it.
So, no first amendment in France. Got it.
The Imams are for all intents and purposes teachers. You need to gain a licence and/or certificate to teach in schools. Whats wrong with this.
Props to the Muslim community. If it is truly a religion of peace this is a strong step. 
Look like **France again needs good beating from ISIS Brothers**


Allah o Akbar
There is no tolerant islam. Islam simply isn't tolerant. These suggested rules are flawed from the start.

. 
This is the type of response that's needed.  I hate all the people that say that ISIS, Hizballah, Hamas, etc. "Have nothing to do with Islam."  It's not a coincidence.  Take some accountability for your brothers.
Amen.

&gt;Ottawa (AFP) - Canada will next year become the first country in the G7 bloc of leading economies to legalize marijuana, the government said Friday in a speech by the governor general.

&gt;Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had promised the move during the recent election campaign that swept his Liberals to power, after two previous administrations failed to follow through on a similar pledge.

There's the entire article.

*Edit: How the fuck is this front page news?! Lol*
Thanks for the comprehensive report Yahoo. It was so thorough and informative. No wonder so many people use your search engine.
"This just in: CANADA BUILDS WALL TO KEEP OUT AMERICAN POT SMOKERS"
If you guys needs some help figuring out infrastructure details, Colorado is writing a manual for all states/countries on our experience with legal Marijuana, what was successful, what we would have done different, etc.
Can we ban Yahoo "News" from /r/WorldNews please?

Edit: fully deserved quotes.
Next year is anything from a month to thirteen months.. Wish they'd specify a bit more than that. Nonetheless I am ecstatic to have a progressive Canada back. 
HOLY FUCK, BOYS
I hope TPB have a backup plan...
Not much of an article ... Kinda clickbait if you ask me?
There's no bill introduced yet to even get started. Our parliament just finally opened. 

Talk about counting your chickens before the eggs are even laid. 
What a glorious day for Canada, and therefore, the world. 
Now all you Americans can come up here and boost our economy.
I only hope for it to be a controlled substance like alcohol. Gotta be a certain age to buy it, smoke it, intoxication rules,  certain licenses to produce, distribute and sell.
&gt; Canada will next year become the first country in the G7 bloc of leading economies to legalize marijuana, the government said Friday in a speech by the governor general.

The comments here so far are mostly whining about how this isn't news. The news is that today, the Governor General said they're legalizing next year. 

That quote is 50% of the article. No excuse for not reading it. 
was already planning to go to Canada next year. I'm in NY so i was thinking Montreal. Any other places i should think about that make for a cheap vacation? 
Can't wait for Tims to start serving weed donuts.
I just can't believe I lived long enough for this to finally happen, the US can't be far behind. 
[First thing I thought of when I saw this](https://cdn.discourse.org/boingboing/uploads/default/65361/5fb0dda8672aa619.jpg)
One thing that really bothers me, at least for BC, is it sounds like the BC liqour stores are getting the right to sell, which means taking jobs and income away from our citizens across the province who own dispensaries, as it will force them to close up shop. These are people who have been fighting for the legalization of pot for decades, I don't see how it is right that the sale authority goes to the group who has opposed it the whole time, rather than those who fought for it. 
Vancouver especially will get hit hard with this, as they have lots of dispenceries.  
Watch their tax revenue go through the roof. Meanwhile, in the US we keep blowing money putting users in jail &amp; funding south american anti-drug armies. 
That sounds brilliant! 

Now, can we push that Commonwealth Freedom of Movement act petition again? I'd like to move to Canada now plz.
DUDE
In British Columbia, a thousand *fucking* *insane* mad scientist demon weed sorcerers cackled loudly, eager to unleash their FEV Super Mutant weed upon the unsuspecting world.  
I can see Canada from my house. Cant wait 
Good for Canada. This war on drugs is total bullshit.
The Government and the people will benefit from this.
Guess who doesn't... the dealers/cartels etc.


Holy fuck boys, we did it. Now we can buy everything with hash coins
We already knew that since Oct 19, can I repost this every few weeks for internet points also ?
All together now: "Ohhh Can... a.. bis....
More like a G6.
This country is going to pot
Oh man Trailer Park Boys are fucked now.
They are doing a good job at making the rest of the world look like fools. 
Thats dope! 
How the fuck does "Yahoo News" stay in business.  Who goes to that shit, click bait sight for actual news?  You couldn't site anything better.  There's nothing in this "article" we didn't know weeks ago. 
Well fuck boys, it's not rocket appliances. 
Some Canadians came out in protest telling reporters "The marijuana will ruin our country.  It can make people do horrible things like say heck and not wave back to a friendly hello."
Maple syrup infused with THC oil. Neverending pancake feast incoming.

Honestly, this is great for Canada because the war on drugs has had more negative effect than drug addiction has had on our society.

However, once this is passed, I would like to see governments focus more on reducing the use of marijuana, especially among young people. We didn't make all of that progress on cigarettes just to get our people addicted on another harmful substance.
We did it reddit
Canada seams nice.  
All canadians interested in indoor gardening are welcome on /r/SpaceBuckets! 
Even though I'm not really a fan of the stuff, I wish Canada the best of luck (or whatever you need) to see this through as fast as possible. I hope other countries follow suit, but I'm pretty sure mine (Germany) won't anytime soon, even though everyone smokes already.
Let me be the 20,053th to say fuck yes
Beauty eh?
Looks like I need to apply for my passport.
It'll be even more pleasant when Trump wins the presidency and I decide to flee to Canada with my family. 

Hey /u/dgr8one,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Lets get it legalized, and taxed already please... Then maybe we can stop doing things like putting a $4.00 toll (one way) to cross a bridge on Trans Canada 1... 
Headlines from 2016:

Colorado secedes from union, uses new-found wealth to float over Idaho and join the Commonwealth. No one the wiser.

Poor Ricky
Man, I remember it wasn't even 10 years ago I was having a conversation with my dad and he told me that he thought never in his lifetime would weed ever be legal. 

Granted, I am American. And this was just at the start of the medical marijuana movement, but man...things have come so far, so soon. 

The future for this plant to really help people, the economy, the world, is really really real. 
That's truly good news.  Draconian punishments for trivial offenses have cost too many too much.

I'm glad to see progress up North, I only hope the US follows suit.
Oh Canada, you so sensible.
elease all those convicted for marijuana?
Unfortunately I'm 90% sure the UK gov'ment will not follow suit. We once led the world in progressiveness but now we're trying our damnedest to stay in the 1970s.
Everybody move to Canada, smoke lots of pot. Everybody move to Canada right now. -C!
gee, here come legalize movement

if it was legal in NZ i would grow a plant outside just because i could
Gee. Canada sure is a nice place
Wow Canada, you need to work on your conformation skills. How can we be an ally if you always implement more rational laws than us? Jerks.
Why is this upvoted so much? There is literally 0 new news in this article. What the hell, Reddit. Further proof that no one reads articles.
real men and women get shit done after they smoke weed *flexes biceps* 
Of course. Right after I have to stop smoking because of a-fib.
Cool, good job Canadian that's nice
This is exactly why Canada has nice things.

I really hope Ricky doesn't find out....
Canada is going to save the world I'm convinced.
With these almost daily mass shootings, assbackwards laws/politicians fucking up the country left and right, I need to get the fuck out of here asap. 
Psychedelics are making a resurgence in society. Makes me optimistic. 
in b4 americans who hate gay marriage want to move to canada suddenly on facebook.
Brace yourselves... Canadian flags with pot leaves instead of maple leaves are coming.
Retirement plans : Canada 
boys, we are absolutely faacked
I have high expectations for this.
🎶Blame Canada, Blame Canada!🎶

-I mean, 🎶Yay Canada! Yay Canada!🎶
Fuck yeah Canada 
This is first on my page and the media scavengers and FBI fuckery is second.

Anyone else feel like things are just crazy in the world again so Canada's like "fuck this shit, I'm getting high."
United States population shrinks by 33%. 
A great day for Canada and therefore the rest of the world.
Does anyone else find it kind of cute that we're calling it G7 because we're mad at Russia and not talking to them right now so we kicked them out of our club?
Uruguay... still the best!
I prefer my nations GT or F-150
I can't wait till this comes to America
Their national flag is actually pretty spot on now.
honey pack the backs where heading to canada!
Most uninformative article ever. so short it should have been a tweet. 
Clickbait.

The drug war has failed. This is just one win in the long future of repealing the drug war that has unjustly thrown millions of people all across the world in jail.

/r/trees is probably getting ready to pack up and move to Canada
That's it I'm moving to Canada!
moving to Canada
It's a good start, but IMO all drugs should be legal. The crime is produced by the illegality, not the drugs themselves. No, heroin and cocaine are not good for you, and yes, people on these drugs can do bad things, however, the illegality has created significantly more criminal activity. Thoughts?
A great day for Canada, and therefore the world
I hope other drugs come next. Serious comment
Smoking pot has more or less been legal in canada for a decade or more.  No one knows anyone who's been arrested for simply smoking a joint, even in public.  It's a contextual thing in canada.  Get high in a park? Fair enough. 

Get high in a park in full view of some kids, the elderly or some other inappropriate situation?  That's a mother fucking paddlin', son.

We like mutual respect in canada. After it's legalized you'll still have to answer some questions if you're smoking a joint in front of city hall, same as if you were drinking a beer there. 

TLDR: doing anything respectfully in canada is most likely to be ok with our police, pot included. Always has been.
Fuck the UK, I'm moving to Canada.
American here. Canada is a fucking legit country. Beautiful, peaceful and up on the times. Cheers, Canada. 
Hope Trudeau has an easier time with this than the person in the photo will have rolling that much weed with a single paper.
Dude weed lmao
Wow, we're really making a difference in the world!
Man, Ricky and Julian are going to have a melt down.
Errbody gon' git rekt
This article is sad.  
I'm so fucking excited.
Canada to hire trump to build wall and keep out americans.
Canadank
Wow, this is terrific news! Thank you Canada!
Legalizing marijuana in Canada is like legalizing beer in Germany :D 
Wow congrats guys 
Good job Trudeau, our American border crossing friends are going to expect every vehicle crossing the border is potentially smuggling weed. The US government is going to lay down the smack if this actually happens.
Congrats Canada, nice to see at least one country has some sense.
I think the Canadians misunderstood. I think they confused marijuana with maple leaves
Between this and Donald Fucking Trump, I may be moving to Canada.
Not sure how I feel about this. Not looking forward to smelling pot everyday from all my neighbors. I find it strange how I smell/notice more people smoking weed here in BC then when I lived in the netherlands. Dont care if people smoke it at home but dont really want to be smelling it in public all the time.
Aboot damn time.
I was gonna expatriate and move to Canada and then I got high.
The American dream still exists... In canada
Canada is now the dankest country on earth.
Does this mean that Trump will now have to build TWO new border walls? 
My weed dealer is legitimately frightened about this, as it's his full-time job. He's not well-positioned to take advantage of legalisation, so he's probably going to have to find new work. 
A great day for Canada, and therefore, the world.
cheers! 
Good for you Canada :) I wish my country could be rational. But that will never happen :(
Yahoo!
The article was only 5% of the whole page. 
Jay Baruchel's gonna be so happy. 
G7... Legalizing marijuana...

Sounds like Canada is really taking off. 
I feel like anyone can get a job at Yahoo news....
Man... it's about time.
Is this true?
Hurry up already 
i'm just curious to see how much the price goes up...
Hey heyy
Why Italy is part of G7?
[deleted]
Leading the way Canada! Right on!
26 miles from the border, fuck yeah!!! 
So, if it's legalized, where will we be able to smoke it? Will it be like alcohol? Not in public, etc? This question sounds really stupid but I honestly don't know how it would work. 
What will Trailer Park Boys be about then?
Question: what impact does this have on drug testing? Can a business still fire you if marijuana is legal?
Sweet, winning my bet. 
During his campaign, newly elected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to legalize cannabis, a bold move that would make Canada the first G7 country to do so at the federal level. However, the path to legalization is unclear and Mr. Trudeau has been short on details. Many questions exist: How long will it take? What will the role of the provinces be? Should cities like Vancouver and Victoria move ahead with regulating dispensaries or wait for guidance from the federal government? Will home production be allowed? What happens to the existing medical marijuana program? How will access for patients be protected in a full adult-use market?
about fucking time
You know, I bet guys like Al Capone are looking up at us in envy of the drug trade and modern prohibition. 

Like, this shit is world wide. Not even limited to ignorant Americans as we so like to joke. This is the ENTIRE WORLD that treats this plant like it's the worst substance to exist while some countries look at tobacco and alcohol as if they were god given. 

It's insane to me. Like...dude, it's a plant. A plant..a harmless plant that even has legitimate benefits to society and civilization both commercially with hemp and medicinally with its THC.

Congratulations to Canada for being the smartest kid in the dumb class. No offense to the dumb kids. 
As an native Oregonian, bravo Canada! Love they just decided to skip the whole "let's legalize it as an experiment" in a few states and went all in.
Do it already, sick of waiting 3 hours on delivery
Still cold as fuck, something that they can't legislate a fix for.  Stayin right here thx.

Rob Ford will be proud https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-HMgfLRycg
This just got real. 
I live in California and we basically have legal weed here. It should be voted to be truly legal without any MM card next year. However, the federal fight is the real issue. I've been saying it'll happen by 2020 for about 4 years a now and I think I will be proven correct. Just gotta have patience.
Meanwhile in Canada...
The Canadian tourism industry will explode.
In the meantime, Americans should visit the beautiful state of Colorado! Come experience a Rocky Mountain High at altitude. 

Way to go Canada, eh!
As a Canadian, how can I exploit this for financial gain? 
What is a G7 Country? and why is it called that?
For those who are interested, [this site](https://www.trudeaumetre.ca/) keeps track of Trudeau's promises, and how many he keeps. (x-post from /r/internetisbeautiful) 
Now where did I put my passport?
Well now I hope Ben Carson wins the election so I have to follow through with my "will move to Canada" threat!!
Yeeeeaaaah, the Great Green North!
Blaze it! 
"wede"
Well done Canada!
Like a G6
As an American living within walking distance of the border, I am thoroughly pleased to hear this. 
Well, it seems likely the US is likely to follow suit shortly (the parts that haven't already, anyway).

Going to be awkward for some international treaties, but eh.
Just out for a rip are ya Canada?
I fucking toe de sow.
G7?

I was about to say "How the fuck can I learn this from a reddit link from a yahoo news source BEFORE my own canadian national news??"

I remember they had just finally legalized divorce while I was visiting the country when I was younger.
D'ya reckon this will affect our votes in the Eurovision? Ones full of them gays, like Holland will give us their 12 points, and ones like Russia will give us nil pointe. 
Meanwhile you can get arrested for this in my country (India).
So, Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction left in the UK and Ireland to not have same sex marriage. Maybe one day.
Dear Ireland. You rock. 
Ireland has shown the world that it has long shook itself free from unreasonable Victorian morality in favour of simply letting people be happy. 
This really is wonderful, a great day in irish history.  BUT we cannot call ourselves a Progressive or modern country when we still deny women safe accessible abortions. 

2016 will be the year we over throw these barbaric laws I hope and on that day I will say I am proud to be irish. 
Yay for love! I'd ask what took them so long, but much like Obergefell-Hodges (nationwide marrige eqality in the US of A), I'm pleasantly surprised.
Right if Ireland has it and Britain has it maybe between us we can pressurise that odd bit in the North to behave.
10:35AM - My work building remains unaffected by the flames. Watch this space.
On my birthday, I went to an Irish pub in Boston the day it passed in Ireland (or something in the courts passed, I forget). I was wearing a rainbow beanie and an old Irish man hugged me and congratulated me, it was one of the sweetest things a stranger has done for me.
Some good news for a change :)

How Ireland has changed..

Not that long ago I lived in an Ireland that frowned upon sex outside of marriage, an Ireland where condoms were unavailable, corporal punishment still happened in some schools and even an Ireland where arranged marriages still happened.

It seems Ireland has moved forward 100 years in the last 25.

I'm happy that Ireland has changed, I'm surprised how quick it happened.

Now let's talk about abortion....
Yes voter here. Delighted to hear this at last.
Got engaged in August and our parents haven't stopped pushing for a wedding date! So proud of my country and fellow Irish men and women! Grá is the law!
Hon the boys
For a country full of stone phalluses, this is surprisingly late in coming. 
As an Englishman in Dublin (Sorry...), I find all these comments to accurately portray the Irish populace.
I was just thinking what the fuck America, it's legal in Ireland we need to step our shit up. Then I realized we already did that and so little changed for me that I'd forgotten for a second it'd already happened. 
Instead of making same-sex marriage legal you might solve most of your problems if you just outlaw Catholicism.
ireland are decriminalising drugs and now gay marriage, one of the most religious countries in europe is now one of the most progressive too.
*looks out window*

No signs of the apocalypse yet.
Abortion needs to be legalised also.
I'm sorry, guys. I am really stupid. Can someone explain this to me? I was under the impression that Ireland already legalized same sex marriage back in May or something?
Good to hear. It will be a great day when most of the world has same sex marriage legal.
I like that we're at the point now where I can see news like this and think "wait, it wasn't already?"
That's a lovely counter-point to the horrible week-end. Love and progress VS hate and middle-age ideology. It's good because it helps us to remember what we are: yes, we can be destructive and angry (ISIS will taste the bitter medicine) but we are also open and warm and looking to the future.
Turns out all that cultural angst about whether a (fairly) religious society could accept same-sex marriage was, in fact, nothing but blarney.
Makes sense, it's 2015
Good news, congrats! 
Yay!
Wow, wasn't that a pretty quick process? I remember reading about the proposal just a couple of months ago.

Nice to see it happen so soon. 
Maybe now I can go get myself an Irish husband.
So, Northern Ireland is the only jurisdiction left in the UK and Ireland to not have same sex marriage. Maybe one day.
Whilst abortion remains illegal...
I'm so proud to have had my small part to play in voting for marriage equality. I guess democracy kind of works? 
Finally.
love your website

Why would you call the sisters Claire and Daire?!
Same sex fake marriage certificate dealers are going to be pissed
Wasn't this legalized back a couple months ago?  Or did I just read that they were pushing for it? 
[deleted]
Woot!
If you thought this was old news and you're also too lazy to read the article:

&gt;Same-sex marriage has now become legal in the Republic of Ireland, after new legislation came into effect on Monday.

&gt;The law was passed after a referendum in May, when the Irish state became the first in the world to legalise same-sex civil marriage by popular vote.

I had no idea, since Facebook hadn't offered the chance to change profile pictures to that of an Irish flag :(
Go Ireland!!!! :) 
Poe's law is in extreme effect here: Is that website a parody of extremism, or ACTUAL extremism?
I have a déja vu about this.

Was it the same thing but with the other Ireland or was it something else but with this Ireland?
This deserves drinking to eh
I shocked............ what happened. any one tell me how much country also apply this rule...? 
The title sounds like a headline you would see in Plague Inc. 
Congrats on the events in Ireland. it must have been a glorious day.
Didn't this happen months ago? Or was that something else.
What about abortions? 
How anyone would want to marry is something that amazes me the most. I would sooner fight for being illegal for me to marry than the other way around. 
Happy news!
Now do sheep and first cousins and the Irish will be the happiest people on earth! 
It wasn't???
And now they're in the Euro's 2016. yay. Congrats Ireland.
Very progressive of Ireland
This is a few months old.
Yes something positive happened in the world!
Not sure why ANYONE would want to get married, but its their choice i guess. Be as miserable as all other married couples.
If there is an indication in the world, bar none.
its 2015....... how is it not legal world wide?
Whats more impressive is, as I recall, they didnt legalize divorce until the 90s
I'm told by theatre buddy it's from the President that he just wants to destroy you all from him being an avid fallout 4 fan?
How can it just now become legal it it wasn't illegal before ?
Well done, Ireland! Another nation takes a right step forward for humanity.
However what I experienced.
Sick shit bud, keep it up Ireland!
#LoveWins in Ireland too. WoW
what would Jesus say! think...

I hope that someday soon our Northern siblings will be able to brag this happy occasion!
I'd rather drown
Wait so the USA had gay marriage before most of Europe? Freedom intensifies*
DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF THING!

CAREFUL NOW

Good job, Ireland!

*Edit: Not meant as sarcastic. I'm genuinely happy*
I've been having the same sex for years.
So two women can get married but they can't get an abortion?

Seems like the only reason this happened is because it impacts men.

Men's rights &gt; women's rights in Ireland.
Now we can use that joke where Patrick Fitzgerald and Gerald Fitzpatrick get married.
This is how we fight ISIS
If it wasn't for the pictures, I'd have no idea if Orla and Grainne were male or female.
Small world when you know the family pictures in the article. Great progress, glad it's finally come around after the difficulties for so many during the campaign.
I didn't know it was illegal in Ireland. Weird.
Hasn't it been for several months?
[deleted]
Well, I guess it's germanys turn now!
Eirinn gay brach!
Surprised it didn't come sooner seeing as the Irish will take any excuse for a piss up
I'm sure the north will follow in about 50 years which is the religious buffer for how many years behind the times you have to be.
It's about time they caught up with the ultra-progressive State of Mississippi.
It only shows how little impact the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, and Christianity in general, has upon society. 
Great news. Freedom shouldn't be bound by sex or sexual orientation.
Sadly in Northern Ireland this process is being undemocratically blocked by religious fundamentalists. 
Still oppresses those who want more than 1 legally recognized best friend though.
Absolutely appalled.  Governments should not allow this to happen although I'm not sure how they could control it nowadays.  Do they not realize how it could bother the children as they grow up?  It's just the worst when siblings are given rhyming names.  Ugh.  How *daire* they...
This the best birth control ever. 
it was illegal?

i guess you HAD to be a catholic priest to get some action over there.
Who in their right would get married nowadays, though?
Do ya'll polygamy will ever be legal?
Just throwing my opinion out there. There was nothing wrong with civil partnerships and they didn't need marriage. As marriage (in my eyes) is still between a man and a woman. Please no hate. But this site is so to the left I'm gonna guess I will be.
Now that it is legal in Ireland, do any UKers here think that the UK will ever get nation-wide gay marriage? I know it was easier here in the US since there were no Federal-level laws against it to begin with. The UK, Germany, and Italy are still the major holdouts in Europe.
now if the north would just stop being useless recidivistic wastes of air
The Muslim immigrants won't like that! 
Welcome to the 21st century, Ireland! Now, I don't want to make this awkward, but about those abortion laws...
Where's my facebook filter?
so now Gays can fight w lawyers when they wanna break up. 
Lawyers just gained a shit ton of new customers....
Nice. Time to dust off the old Seamus Fitzpatrick and Patrick fits Seamus joke.
big deal...doesn't japan have marriage between humans and robots?
The Catholic Church can't be too happy about that.
Same sex is good according to this man https://youtu.be/bEaoNV2T5rc
damn
I felt a great disturbance in New England, as if millions of Irish-American grandparents suddenly grumbled in discontent and were suddenly silenced.
What is this madness? Next you're gonna tell me that we're going to do this in the U.S.
but abortion still isn`t. 
Why does government have any say in a private marriage contract between consenting adults?
Michael Fitzpatrick and Patrick Fitzmichael?
And here I always thought that an Irish homosexual was an Irishman who loved women more than whisky ....
Wait... It wasn't legal already? 
Good shit! And I hope this becomes global.
Good Job Ireland!
[deleted]
Implying that marriage still isn't specifically a bond between a man and a woman. 
Absolute moral digression in the name of progress. We are witnessing the last stage of decay of the global society. I fear for what is ahead, historically it means anarchy, which necessarily leads to autocracy; but what does that look like on a truly, unprecedented, global level? It looks like the final "beast" (i.e., evil dictator) predicted in Revelation and Daniel. Jesus said that the last days (before His return) would be "as the days of Noah". Historically, according to the Egyptian Talmud, the only other time in recorded history that gay marriage was accepted by society was during the days of Noah.  Think about that, we have suddenly as a society "progressed" beyond any other society for the last tens of thousands of years. What blind arrogance! It is the pinnacle of human, God-hating depravity. Make no mistake, this is not progression, it is simply a seared conscience. And it's global!!!! These are truly the last days. Judgement is coming. (Not from me [wink NSA]).

Not Good :(

Menwhile Australia is still backwards and retarded.

I hate it here.
Well, it's kinda sad when the BBC doesn't know it is called Ireland, not the Republic of Ireland. Or when they can't even use language in general.
I'm sure my homophobic, Irish boss is gonna be real pleased... 

Edit: downvote all you want, but y'all aren't the ones getting an earful about "the homos" every once in a while. Shit's annoying. 
O, 'tis a happy day for Gerald Fitzpatrick and Patrick Fitzgerald!
The only thing Irish thing left in the Republic of Irelend is the "pub" in their name.
Yawn... Call me when it is allowed in the African nations, the middle east and parts of the Arab world or basically anywhere that is a 'modern country' and not a western democracy. 

Edit: And Russia where it is actively being campaigned against by the vast majority and you risk being stabbed to death for just being openly gay. 
I wonder how many countries use America as the metric of, "holy shit we are still in the stone age", at this point. Considering our tendency to be behind the rest of the world on so many issues, education etc.... I imagine that is a bit like us going "holy fuck, Afghanistan is better with maternity leave then we are".
[deleted]
Hard to believe advanced countries are still holding onto this bullshit. If people want to marry a damn tree let them. No harm no foul. But we still stick to an eye for an eye like 5 year olds.
Sad
Finally, Ireland joins the developed world. If we didn't have religion, we would already have had legal same sex marriage centuries ago.
Congratulations Ireland and welcome to Europe.
Guinness is changing its recipe over to hard cider in response.
Gerald Fitzpatrick and Patrick Fitzgerald
Hooray for the marriage/divorce industry?
I would still prefer Damien Rice to marry Lisa Hannigan, not his drummer or the proverbial "woman like a man".
After scientists discovered they were actually all the same sex anyway.
As a gay man living in Ireland I know there is still a bit of progress to go when it comes to same sex couples. 
Myself and my fella have gotten some verbal and near physical abuse aimed at us, we have even had some potatoes chucked at us by some teenagers  on bicycles ((Potatoes.. Only in Ireland huh?)) 
All this because we hold hands walking down the streets of Dublin.

Congrats Ireland, I'll be drinking a shot of Jameson tonight for you (not that you need it). 
Took them some fock'in time!
It will be a joy to see them take each other up the aisle.

FTFY
That's good for all Ireland people.
what took u so long?
If you're behind Utah, you're behind.
Marriage is now irrelevant in Ireland
Good.
gays are distinctly their own race today, so I suppose they ought to be given the same avenues and rights as any race/gender of man

I dont think CHURCHES need marry them, but certainly the state may recognize if 2 gays are wed

people who are leading this into abortion, or drugs, are just people with broad agendas, and ought to be ignored
A sad day indeed.
I expected human/sheep marriage to be legal first tbh
If guy marriage is so right, please explain to me why marrying 2 or more wife's or marrying something else is so wrong...# explaintomelikeiam5
Good 
Cool
My brothers wifes grandparents are both devout catholics. They're two of the nicest people I know of. Yet I've noticed that they let their religion influence their opinions towards being more, well, dumb. Topics in which the moral course of action is clear-cut for an atheist/agnostic like myself, is apparently difficult and controversial for them because of their god.

I wish I knew what they think of this. I hope - intensely - that they don't have any retarded religious opinion over how this is "sinful", or anything to that effect.
oh god, I wish I had to irish dads growing up, it'd be awesome.
About time lol
I wonder if they looked at the U.S. and said: "Shit, we *really* need to catch up, guys!"

Hello there Claire and Darie..
There's a lot of misinformation in this thread - he hasn't been retrialled, the justices have determined that law was previously applied incorrectly to the facts, i.e. an appeal was conducted on the basis of an error in law in the previous judgement. Not sure about the US, but this is one of the most common avenues for appeal in adversarial legal systems. 

Basically, the original decision found that "common law murder" was irrelevant, as Pistorius "did not subjectively foresee...a possibility, that he would kill the person behind the door, let alone the deceased as he thought she was in the bedroom".

The appeal court found that as Pistorius armed himself with a gun and fired four shots at the door, it was clearly reasonably foreseeable that death would come to the person on the other side of the door. As such, common law murder was committed.

Putting him on house arrest was a joke, that's where he's most dangerous.
Should have been murder in the first place. There's no way you can shoot through a door like that and not intend to kill whoever is on the other side. 

Also who the hell jumps out of their bed and goes in gung-ho without checking if anyone is sleeping next to you! If you're supposedly keeping your loved ones safe you at least check on them first!
Pistorius was a typical actor, playing the card of the victim, shouting and crying and basically convincing himself that he did nothing wrong....

So he thought his gf was sleeping in bed next to him, he has no legs, not no eyes, he must have seen for sure. 

Is it completely crazy that she went to the bathroom in the middle of the night?

What kind of thief comes through the bathroom window of the second floor bedroom, that's ridiculous. 

Who just unloads 4 shots into a closed bathroom, that's absolutely ridiculous.
 Without warning, without asking who goes there ? How long does it take for a dude with no legs to get a gun, if there was an intruder, well if you thought there was wouldn't you warn your gf or at least check is she is OK. Bullshit everywhere.

The only thing I cannot really account for is living in South Africa, I don't know how dangerous it actually is. How much on standby you have to be, especially as a dude with no legs. Anyway he got what he deserved in my opinion. 

Christmas came early for us South Africans. Oscar gets convicted and our rugby coach quits.
"Elementary precaution of firing a warning shot"....

a simple "Who's there?" would have sufficed. Particularly if the next thing you say can truthfully be "I have a gun!"
Can someone explain to me how judge Masipa could have interpreted the law so wrongly? 
This makes me happy, his first sentence was an utter joke. 
My impression of the man, rightly or wrongly, is that he's a straight up killer with a nasty temper.  I feel glad today that Reeva finally got some justice, as did her grieving family.
It was difficult to understand this case. How a man, not intoxicated by substances, could get up from a shared bed at night, in response to a perceived threat, take his gun from under his pillow, take the gun from its holster, get up and go to the bathroom door, and never know where his lover was, and never even look for her next to him and think of her to protect her, is beyond my comprehension of all behaviour.

I can't figure out Roux. It is clear this was his case, more than it was even that of Pistorius. His defence was too brilliant. Every thin wedge was invaded with an army. Every invading army opposed those he had sent before it, until the case he constructed collapsed under all of the contradictions. and the simple questions that required simple answers disappeared. It wasn't even the South African, or any legal system when Roux finished with it all. It was a discrete bubble or unreality where everything made a madcap sense spoken to a new lingo.

Finally, the Appeal Court said, "No Mr. Roux, Oscar Pistorius lives in this world, with this language, and the fantasy is over. A man intends the natural consequences of his actions."

That is justice.

Key bits of the article: 

&gt; South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the lower court did not correctly apply the rule of dolus eventualis - whether Pistorius knew that a death would be a likely result of his actions.

&gt; Reading the ruling reached by a panel of five judges, Justice Lorimer Leach said that having armed himself with a high-calibre weapon, Pistorius must have foreseen that whoever was behind the door might die.

&gt; Pistorius always maintained that he believed that there was an intruder in the house but the judge said that the identity of the person behind the door was irrelevant.
This is the first time i have ever fist pumped at a BBC news update on my phone. Common sense should prevail and it is clear to anyone that the whole defense of "i thought it was a burglar" was beyond ridiculous.
Good, I watched the original trial and found the verdict ridiculous. If there's an intruder in your bathroom, then the first thing you do is check if your partner is still in bed with you. If he or she is not, then it's logical to assume they're the person in the bathroom... so you don't shoot several times through the door without warning or asking who the person is. 
This is a good development. Poor reeva.
About time. Who blindly fires into their own closed bathroom door? 
[Jim Jefferies-Oscar Pistorius](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2bwkfc_jim-jefferies-bare-oscar-pistorius-the-blade-runner_fun)
Just watching the Today show. The reporter stimulated how things would have gone. He had to go around to her side of the bed to get the gun, where he would have seen she wasn't in bed.

They also showed it would have been quicker and easier to simply run out the front door, than try to take on an intruder in the bathroom. 

After seeing that, it's very hard to believe this was anything other than intentional.
Who knew South Africa is more effective at persecuting star athletes for crimes they committed than the United States. Hello OJ Simpson and Ray Lewis.
&gt;**"In the result, on count 1 in the indictment the accused ought to have been found guilty of murder on the basis that he had fired the fatal shots with criminal intent in the form of dolus eventualis.
As a result of the errors of law referred to, and on a proper appraisal of the facts, he ought to have been convicted not of culpable homicide on that count but of murder."**

In other words, first trial was a farce, sent to appeal, justice served.
[live article with more info](http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/dec/03/oscar-pistorius-appeal-court-guilty-murder-reeva-steenkamp-live)
is there any new video of him bawling like a little baby? murderous piece of shit. 
Appellate judges in the US cannot increase the severity of a conviction like this. Can any barristers from South Africa explain why appellate judges have such wife discretion and the frequency of such decisions? 

As an aside, it does seem justice has now been served.
Who hears a noise in the *bathroom* of all places, and doesn't take the time to check if their girlfriend is sleeping beside them still? If not, I can almost guarantee where she is. 

IMHO he probably knew, at least in the back of his mind, that she was in there. 
Good. Didn't believe that asshole's story for a second. 
Yeah cause a burglar would walk past you sleeping in your bed, go into the bathroom, close the door and take a dump. He thought she was in the bedroom? Oh you wake up and she's obviously not in bed with you, do you think she's hiding under the bed or something?
Here's what really happened, they got into an argument, she got mad and went to the bathroom to get away from him, he got pissed and fired 4 shots thru the bathroom door at her. Case closed.
&gt;The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years, but the judge does have the discretion to lower it.

Wtf? Then it's not a minimum is it??
I hope someone shoves his own leg up his asshole in jail.
Good. It's amazing he almost dodged the first conviction. What kind of idiot would possibly belief he thought a burglar was locked in his bathroom?

"Hmm, my girlfriend's not in bed...and there's someone in the bathroom. I better start shooting just to be safe!"

He's either a lying murderer, or the dumbest gun-owner in the world. Either way, he deserves jail and that's some pretty good lawyering to have kept him out of it so far.
Roses are red,
Violets are glorious, 
Never sneak up
On Oscar Pistorious. 
Poor little tink tink 
[Y'all should check out Jim Jeffries bit on the matter.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9MdQpT684c)
Hooray! The guy who thinks he is such a special snowflake that rules (olympics) &amp; laws don't apply to him should FINALLY get what he deserves

I don't understand why there is any talk of the judge possibly LOWERING the minimum sentence. He should get the MAXIMUM time allowed by law, which I'm guessing, is life.

His version of events REEKS. Any NORMAL loving mate, while sleeping with a loved one beside them, upon hearing the noise of a potential burglar in a high crime area, would FIRST wake his loved one and alert her to the possible danger, THEN go investigate.

Even failing to do that, a NORMAL person, upon discovering the noise was coming from behind a closed bathroom door, would call out their loved ones name, ie: "Reeva? Is that you???", before they started blasting away.

The judge should make sure this lying, arrogant, narcissistic, jealous excuse of a man doesn't see the outside of a prison for the rest of his natural days, and if he could, order that, once dead, he be cremated and have his ashes sprinkled over the prison grounds.
The sentence in the article, "The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years but judges can apply some discretion," doesn't make any sense to me. Is 15 years a mandatory minimum for murder, or do the judges have the discretionary power to shorten it?
&gt; Pistorius always maintained that he believed there was an intruder in the house but the judge said that the identity of the person behind the door was "irrelevant to his guilt".
Justice Leach compared it to someone setting off a bomb in a public place not knowing who the victims might be.

Sorry, but assuming he actually believed it was an intruder, it's not  like that at all. I still support the sentence, mind you. That's just a stupid comparison.
Better late than never.  Bastard.
&gt;The judge... added that Pistorius did "not take that most elementary precaution of firing a warning shot".


In other news, I see that Justice Leach is banned from /r/ProtectAndServe
Good.
good.  fuck that guy.  he shot up his girlfriend on purpose.
&gt;We don't have a date yet, but it will be next year. The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years, but the judge does have the discretion to lower it.

I don't think my definition of minimum is the same as theirs.
Jim Jefferies Recap of what went down: http://youtu.be/S9MdQpT684c
Well when you kill someone...
After reading the headline, I was looking for either a joke, or *another* murder. How anyone saw it as otherwise is beyond me.

Dude killed her. Dude admitted that he killed her. With his gun. Using 4 shots. When only he, and her were in his guarded villa... *Couldn't* have been murder.
[Jim Jefferies-Oscar Pistorius](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2bwkfc_jim-jefferies-bare-oscar-pistorius-the-blade-runner_fun)
He'll be a free man in less than seven years. No doubt he'll get the minimum fifteen year sentence, minus the year he already spent on prison, then out after half his sentence. Disgusting really for a murderer. Also that original judge ought to be struck off. 
Fuck me this again..... god damn that is an annoying justice system...

Just imagine how shitty this is if the guy actually is telling the truth, what a fucking ride
You know what?  I got one fucking leg....wait a minute....I got NO fucking legs....   Oh, I'm married to a supermodel. She's gorgeous. You know what else?  I got me some gold medals and shit.
But...what I really think is a good idea, I'm gonna shoot my beautiful wife, through the bathroom door. Yeah...hell yeah...that is a fucking fine idea right there....yup....

You stupid motherfucker.
I guess justice can finally be served to an extent. 

You have to wonder though why the law was interpreted as it was and he was only done for 'culpable homicide' 
Interesting. I've seen lots of people defending the previous verdict. Now everyone suddenly agrees that the previous verdict was nonsense. It seems to me that people just like the winner. When Pistorious won the trial, everyone agreed with him, now that he lost everyone disagrees.
Rot in jail you bastard.
Good! Fuck that evil cunt.
"Rehabilitation is better than incarceration" - Reddit when talking about the general population for non-specific crimes.

"Incarcerate him for longer!" - Reddit when the person and crime is known.
&gt; "As a matter of common sense at the time the fatal shots were fired, the possibility of the death of the person behind the door was clearly an obvious result.
"And in firing not one but four shots, such a result became even more likely," the judge said.
Pistorius always maintained that he believed there was an intruder in the house but the judge said that the identity of the person behind the door was "irrelevant to his guilt".
Justice Leach compared it to someone setting off a bomb in a public place not knowing who the victims might be.

If Pistorius had shot an intruder and not Reeva, would he still be convicted of murder? Because this makes it seem like he would've been, and that sounds fucked.
We all knew he was guilty right off the bat. It was shoddy police work and a corrupt judicial system that allowed the slime bag to get off. 
What the hell is on the bed in that prison cell photo??
The thing that never made sense to me is ok sure it could be an intruder, but when you wake up in the middle of the night because someone is in your house, you check to see if your SO is ok, especially if they were previously sleeping beside you

Also, are fake legs considered weapons inside jail?
Not come on .. the first thing i do when i break into a house, is going to the toilet.
wow that sucks, going from 1 year in jail and a few years house arrest and thinking all is fine and well, to having bomb dropped on your head and facing 15 year minimum in a place you already got a taste of and left behind. he might be contemplating suicide at this point. 
I mean, if you put 4 bullets in a person, that seems like it's murder. 

The fact that they found grey area in the case is amazing.

Nevertheless, that son of a bitch got what was coming to him.
As messed up as the US legal system is, at least you can't be convicted without a jury against your will here.
From a strictly legal perspective the defence didn't have a leg to stand on. 
JUSTICE!
This is the story of the age of Pistoriois, at of Pistoriois 
If she wasnt in the bed next to him, she MIGHT be in the bathroom. But no, it was an intruder. Yeah right. Makes more sense.....to no one.
Finally he was clearly guilty! I think he killed her out of jealously because I heard she went for a meal with her ex boyfriend that same day, may have been boiling up over a period of time, correct me if I am wrong though people. She probably walked into the bathroom after arguing with him asking her why did you go for a meal with him etc etc where/why was you there then etc etc she stormed into bathroom he lost his rag and shot through the door, that's what I think happened. 
Po lil tink tink
I must be missing something. Accidental shooting seems plausible to me. Couldn't he just have been a paranoid and reactive person? Does he have a history of violence or something? 
Finally,the dude ran out of luck! 
Hey, check it out, the sky is blue and... yep, grass is green.

We're learning so much today!
&gt;women's rights groups [argued] he should have been found guilty of murder as a deterrent because of the high number of women who are killed by their partners in the country.

As a side-note - because I personally agree that the evidence suggests his actions were deliberate and reckless, upholding the murder charge - I take issue with this part of the case. Regardless of the fact that the case now fits these activists' agendas, I think that suggesting that someone's criminal trial should be deliberately trumped up or that a specific verdict *should* be reached solely as an "example" to would-be offenders is despicable. If anything, it borders on charging the person for the crimes of others; "Your crime was your own but we're going to prosecute more heavily to make up for other offenders who went unpunished." A person can and should only be tried/sentenced for their own offences.

If you feel that the crime your activism works to stem isn't punished to a great enough extent, focus your movement on changing the law itself, not on hunting down scapegoats to collectively atone for those who slip through the cracks. Nobody should be offered up as a blood sacrifice on the altar of proportional punishment.
So, you think you hear someone in the bathroom. And the first thing you think is not, is my GF ok, or to whisper out to her, or to feel in the dark where she is, making sure she is ok, but to fire 4 shots through the door.
So I haven't really followed this story much, is the general consensus that he murdered her or thought she was an intruder?  
This will be controversial but I'm going to say it anyway.

I can kinda see a situation where pistorius would do what he said.

Firstly he is one of the most famous men in South Africa, a country with one of the highest crime rates in the world and where rich people's houses are often targeted.

Second, he has no legs and feels particularly vulnerable, making him highly agitated.

He hears a noise and immediately assumes it's an intruder, grabs his gun and goes to the door.

He has no legs so he can't kick it down, he has no idea who's in there and he's stupidly forgot to check where his gf is (nothing could excuse this stupidity). His instincts have told him that there is an intruder and he is freaking out.

He shouts WHOAREYOUGETTHEFUCKOUT.

bang bang bang bang. 

Opens the door and realises his fatal error... the rest we know.

If this is what happened then it's still murder and he should still go to jail, but for less time.

But then again maybe he did kill her intentionally because he's a crazy shit head, in which case rot for life for all i care. 

I'm just saying that in my eyes this scenario isn't impossible. 
If you easily become upset, angry, or feel that frightening people physically or with weapons puts you back in control of a situation-seek help. 
&gt;He added that Pistorius did "not take that most elementary precaution of firing a warning shot".

I'm fine with everything but this.  A judge, of all people, shouldn't be basing his judgement on Hollywood bullshit.

You *never* fire a warning shot.  There's no such thing as safely discharging a firearm inside a house.  You have no idea where that bullet is going and what it's going to hit before it stops.  You either shoot to end the threat, or don't shoot at all.
I bet he's pissed
Why do I have the gut feeling that domestic abuse against women happens way more often than statistics report?
Oscar "The Pistol" Pistorious
Poor little tink tink.
There seems to be a lot of logic involved in their gun laws compared to U.S. Gun laws.  In the U.S. You can gun down an unarmed person walking off your front lawn with a potted plant and be praised for exercising your rights to protect your property and be hailed as a hero for gunning down a 18 year old kid that is a menace to society.  Although apparently in South Africa even if someone is in your home you have to determine if they are a threat.  Far cry from our rootin tootin cowboy laws.  

I know of a girl whose father was called by someone near his business to let him know it was being burgled (sp?) he drove to it, went inside and gunned down an unarmed man stealing stuff.  He was of course praised for it with no investigation.  I hate the fact people consider property more valuable than a human life.
Where's all the Reddit armchair activists now who were saying the court decided he was not guilty and she clearly knows better than us so stop speaking up about how horrible his aquittal was.

So glad justice has been served for Reeva Steenkamp. Her life can never be gotten back but at least this man can be punished for taking it. This was an open and shut case from the very beginning. How the original trial could have accepted the defense that you get up in the middle of the night and hear a sound. Don't notice that your girlfriend who is in bed right next you isn't there. Don't check to see if it's your girlfriend in the bathroom and assume that there is a robber stealing your hand soaps in the bathroom and instead calling the police or making sure it's not your girlfriend you shoot and kill them, you have witnesses testifying to an hour long argument and to a gunshot, screams and more gunshots, and this is somehow defensible in any court of law in the entire world. This literally boggles my mind. So glad they finally got it right.

One of the reasons the last verdict went down like it did was because it was reached behind closed doors.

You don't want to have a closed door between you and Oscar Pistorius.
[deleted]
It feels like this guy gets convicted every 6 months. 
I found it a little amusing that the large lady beside Reeva's mother wanted to celebrate or be happy about the decision but then looked at Reeva's mother who had no emotion whatsoever and so she backed down and just stared straight ahead again.

For what reason would she want to celebrate anyway.  The charge and the length of time he is in jail won't being her daughter back.  No reason to be happy either way.  Just happy he won't get out.
i hate how morbidly fascinated the world gets about high profile murders. people are genuinely excited by it all, it's actually pretty sickening.
Oscar Pistorious = White OJ Simpson
This is good news as it provides another opportunity to use all the legless jokes again. 
Poor little Tink Tink.

I remember seeing the pictures of him "vommit" in court and trying to break out in tears. He was really convinced that he could fool the court with these cheap tricks. What a horrible little lying psychopath.
As a South African, who cares. 
I watched the original court proceedings very closely, tuning in everyday. The judgement back then seemed ludicrous to me. The evidence definitely leans towards the fact he fired with murderous intent, (whether he knew his girlfriend was behind the door not is irrelevant). I am happy that justice has finally been served for Reeva Steenkamp's family. 
&gt; **When will he be sentenced?**

&gt; We don't have a date yet, but it will be next year. The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years, but the judge does have the discretion to lower it.

If the judge has the discretion to lower it, then 15 years is not the minimum..?

Oscar Pistorious.
[deleted]
What amount of time will he go down for? I imagine they'll count the time he's already spent in jail against his next sentencing? 
It's been so long since I've heard anything about this guy but the moment his name popped up , I remembered Darth Pistorius.

Hey /u/Hunter199090,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Every invading army opposed those he had to rule on.
Justice is finally served 
So did he truly not know that it was his girlfriend inside?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTWDNIgM2pA
I feel for the deceased and her family.  I also feel really sorry for people who make a really bad choice and it fucks them over for the rest of their life.  :(
I was always confused by the first verdict because i truly couldnt understand how you could get up in the night, put on your prosthetic legs, retrieve your gun, walk to bathroom door nd fire four shots through it without ever checking to see if your gf was still in bed or even, i dunno, asking 'who's there in the bathroom, is it a home invader using my toilet'

edit - meant proSTHETic legs obviously. Not prophetic. Ugh. And turns out he didnt even put them on either way
Personally, and without having studied the case isn't sketchy as hell, but you can shoot through the door.
Well, he did murder a person.
He had the worse excuse ever.  I would have said the gun went off by mistake or tried to make it look like a suicide or something. 
Shooting through the door at an 'intruder'. WTF was he thinking?
[deleted]
He should've got done for aimbotting.

Seriously: That's plain bullshit, you can't just nail someone with four shots THROUGH A DOOR.
This is a professional news source?

    **Will he return to jail?**    
    Yes. He will be back behind bars, less than two months after he was placed under house arrest.    

    **When will he be sentenced?**    
    We don't have a date yet, but it will be next year. The minimum sentence for murder is 15 years, but the judge does have the discretion to lower it.    

    **Can he appeal?**    
    Yes, but only if his lawyers are convinced that the appeal judges violated his constitutional rights. So it's a high threshold, and hard to meet.    

    **So is this the end of Pistorius' professional athletics career?**    
    Almost certainly. He's 29, and will be past his prime by the time he is freed. It is also unlikely that advertisers would want to sponsor him, as the Pistorius brand is now tainted.    

Was this written for 2nd graders?
[Redditor from 1 year ago thinks "all redditors are fucking stupid because Oscar is innocent"](http://imgur.com/dFO1Pro)

I guess the high justices are stupid too. 
This still wasn't resolved?
haha good fuck em
Thats why people needa watch those old movies or tv shows where guy comes in the house from work and is all like

Honey im home!!
I bet he's really Pist off.
Why did he kill her? Like..did he have a good motive to do it?
&gt; The judge added that Pistorius did "not take that most elementary precaution of firing a warning shot".

I'm not familiar with South African law, but that seems like a very odd comment to make as firing a warning shot is irresponsible at best. More typically firing a warning shot is strong evidence that your life was not imminently in danger making self defense much harder to argue.
"**What's Next For Pistorius?**"

&amp;nbsp;

My guess is lots of anal punishment. 
I did a whole psychology in law research paper on Oscar and we had to analyze what would make him do this. And the whole time I was pissed off. Because even if you accidentally kill someone like this woman who stopped for ducks on the highway and a motorcyclist rear ended her and died http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/22/newser-woman-who-stopped-for-ducks/11235367/ 
She got sentenced to LIFE IN PRISON. FUCK THIS WORLD! Coming from a fellow rider that is complete and utter BULL SHIT! OSCAR should get life in prison, NOT HER! 

Now, I get it. 2 different countries, 2 different courts, 2 different judges. But it still makes me pissed. 
/r/tabloid
Good luck catching him
...what if his story is true though
"Pistorius' family gave a brief response, saying lawyers are studying the finding who will advise them on "options going forward"."

Umm, OJ? 
What I learned from this is that the BBC audio level goes up to 11. 
And the Oscar Goes To...    Jail.
I was surprised he got charged but then I remembered it wasn't in the US
Seems like he couldnt run from the Law^..............bazinga. 
My god i had no idea this was still going on. 
"Elementary precaution of firing a warning shot"....

a simple "Who's there?" would have sufficed. Particularly if the next thing you say can truthfully be "I have a gun!"
maury: you are not the father!

*celebratory dance*

maury: on second thought, you ARE the father!

*"well shit"*
Reading the ruling reached by a panel of Judges based on the argument of the night?
So I'm confused about something- did he shoot through the bathroom door INTO the bathroom? Or was he in the bathroom shooting through the door?
That's no feat.
He'd probably be given a lower sentence than 15 years.
Meanwhile, here in the US, we'd rather jail harmless young adults who couldn't pay back money, for 20 years. And then setting dangerous murderers free, with much shorter sentances.
I think this is the right sentence, but I'm also kinda bothered by the fact that the courts there can file for a "do-over". The protection from double jeopardy is an important right of the accused.
I'm pissed this guy wasn't who I'd hoped he was when we saw him in the Olympics 
Personally, I haven't looked into the bathroom late at night and locks the door, he does his psycho show Thank you!
OP delivered
quick!!! someone call Jim Jefferies!!!
Did anything come out about why he did it? Or is he just a psychopath
Seems appropriate.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egrnOj-tMSI
[A lot of people don't like him because he *allegedly* murdered somebody. But also, *really*.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTWDNIgM2pA)
So, under South African law you can be found guilty of crime A, then a higher court can just change it to a verdict of guilty of crime B?  Uh what?
He's the OJ of South Africa
Haha stupid guy
[deleted]
What a shitty emotional roller coaster ride
what a handsome dude, too bad he'll be gang-raped and killed in prison. 
That's a punch in the balls. Did a year in jail,gets home thinking that the worst is behind him. Then gets convicted of murder and heading right back to prison.
Good. Who blindly shoots into their bathroom thinking it's an intruder? Not normal acting.
Yehhheaaaah he's guilty.
What a bunch of horseshit 
This is pretty serious punishment for wall-hacking. 
If only the poor girl had been armed with an assault rifle whilst she was taking a pee, because we all know the only way to stop a world class paranoid para-olympian on stumps in the dark in the the dead of night, is err......hang on.....lemme think this thru and I'll get back....
As it appears you are very knowledgeable about South-African laws, maybe then you can point out the errors the judge/court made in the original case, the one where the court did not find him guilty of murder ?
Surely she knew what she was getting into when she sat on that toilet??!
[live article with more info](http://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/dec/03/oscar-pistorius-appeal-court-guilty-murder-reeva-steenkamp-live)
Order in the court! Order in the court!
This obviously extends out to lethal force to subdue a fleeing suspect in the silhouette of night Minimum sentence for murder in South Africa to shoot whatever is making the noise.
Finally some justice and good news.
Good
He strikes me as a spoilt brat who got away with everything by making a big scene when confronted (as a kid). Perhaps all this is partially the result of bad parenting.
Hope this asshole rot in jail
Anyone getting a "The Stranger" vibe? 
I definitely think he deserves more time than the paltry 11 months he served. That being said, I'm not sure how I feel about a legal system where defendants can be re-convicted and re-sentenced at any time. Anyone better informed on South African criminal law care to weigh in?
It was so obvious. You don't go shooting a gun into a closed toilet door without checking where your loved ones or family are. Where are we supposed to believe he thought Reeva was during all of this? Are we supposed to believe he left his bed not seeing, realising or understanding that Reeva was not in the bed beside him and then he just shoots into a closed toilet door because he felt like his life was in immediate danger? Does he expect us to believe he just fired without communicating with the person in the toilet? He knew exactly who was on the other side of the door.

I knew he was guilty, he deserves to pay. Psycho. She didn't want him anymore and he went off the reservation.

The only reason this guy is getting jailed is because he shot a hot blonde woman, which supersedes his victimhood status.
Regardless of whether this guy deserved it or not... it definitely serves as a reminder to not take the rights you have as a US citizen for granted. This kind of practice found in some other countries where the state can appeal the verdict in your criminal trial seems dangerous and opens the door for corruption/abuse in my opinion. I don't approve of it. 
Now prison gets an Oscar before Dicaprio
Kangaroo court, FREE OSCAR!
Apparently Oscar wanted a new bathroom door but Reeva was dead against it.
Katt Williams had this guy's number years ago. " Po l'il tink tink".
This is probably the part of the article that bothers me the most:

******"As a matter of common sense at the time the fatal shots were fired, the possibility of the death of the person behind the door was clearly an obvious result," the judge said.

"And in firing not one but four shots, such a result became even more likely."

Pistorius always maintained that he believed there was an intruder in the house but the judge said that the identity of the person behind the door was "irrelevant to his guilt".

Justice Leach compared it to someone setting off a bomb in a public place not knowing who the victims might be.******

Is it really true that defending yourself in your personal, private home against an unidentified person is the same as killing unidentified people in a public place in South Africa?  I live in a state with a [castle doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_doctrine) which basically states that if someone is in your house and you feel threatened, you are justified in killing them.  Maybe this is a uniquely southern US way of looking at things, but even when I lived in (liberal) NYC I felt that if someone broke into my house I had the right to defend myself by any means necessary.  Do laws like these not exist in South Africa?  What about the rest of the world?
Ya well.. He didn't have a leg to stand on. 
Why isn't this double jeopardy? Can someone from SA explain?
Good. He killed her, he knows he did justice done .......
Am I right in assuming that he appealed the original decision and was found guilty of a higher crime? If he hadn't appealed he would have just served out the original sentence?
I live in Northern Ireland, where they sure as shit don't shun guns.

I've never seen a policeman without an MP5 and handgun.
It's funny how cops are in London. I either saw them toting full auto MP5s or nothing at all. Absolutely no middle ground. 
Let me give a quick overview on the subject for those who care.  I have a little casual knowledge about this.

So these are the bodies of police that routinely carry firearms.

 - *National (Home Office) Police Services* - only Authorised Firearms Officers (AFOs) and Specialist Firearms Officers (SFOs) are trained to carry and use firearms.  You start off as a regular beat bobbie and can apply after your two year probationary period I think.  Must have a clean complaint record during that time.  Each national service has some firearms people to call upon when needed.  Some are busier than others.

 - *Ministry of Defence Police (MDP)* - basically all are trained to AFO standard.  Routinely armed - MoD says 90% of their officers are armed at any one time.  See [here](http://www.mod.police.uk/firearms-training.html).  They mostly police MoD sites, waterways, and stuff.  Basically security guards.  They can be sent to Afghanistan and the like to aid there, which is a bit odd because I know the Army's Royal Military Police (RMP) have handled police services in these countries too, including training the local police forces.  I don't know who does what.

 - *British Transport Police (BTP)* - they police the UK's railways.  Mostly privatised.  Not routinely armed I don't think.  One of their [Specialist Teams](http://careers.btp.police.uk/about_btp/specialist_teams.aspx) is the Counter Terrorism Support Unit, which includes "Armed Policing Capability".  Interestingly, they carry different guns to other UK police services, AR15s instead of G36s and MP5s.  Don't know why, maybe cheaper.

 - *Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC)* - guards areas around nuclear sites, and nuclear materials in transit.  Possibly some overlap with the MDP I think.  All officers trained to AFO standard, routinely armed.

 - *National Crime Agency (NCA)* - newish replacement organisation for the dissolved Serious Organized Crime Agency.  "The UK's FBI" (lol).  They handle major organized crime, heavy firearms, drug and people trafficking stuff, so I supposed it makes sense that they are armed when making arrests.  Honestly I don't know much of how they work, but if you google them you get some swanky publicity pics, so there's that.  And they have been involved in a couple of shootouts already.

And probably some other super special units I'm forgetting.  Maybe some intelligence people, Special Branch, and the like.  But those are the main armed police units as far as I know.

The system works fine enough that nothing will change in the near future.  There would have to be war in the streets before I would expect the police to consider arming more cops.  If anything they should relax some of the rules about civilian gun ownership first - keep most of the licensing rules but allow more calibres and such.  Shooting sports here suck.

Edit: oh shit, I was away for an hour, when I came back I had 10 messages, I was trying to remember what I must have said to piss everybody off!

Since people are actually reading this I'd better add a disclaimer: I have "casual" knowledge of this stuff, meaning *no actual experience*.  I'm not a police officer or soldier or anything like that.  This is all shit I started learning about when I was younger and went through a police officer phase.  We had just got the internet for the first time.  Trying to read pdfs and long articles on dial-up sucks, let me tell you.  So all the above is stuff anybody can find out about with some googling and some googly-moogling.  Later skaters.
Britains been through worse shit than this without changing its policy, why would they suddenly change when france gets attacked?
We have CO19 officers for serious shit. Your average community support officer doesn't need a gun. 
The French police carry guns, that didn't prevent the attacks in Paris nor did it end the attacks. The attacks ended via suicide vests and special swat units. Nations of unarmed beat police like Britain and Ireland to name just two have armed response units and special tactical units that can be called at a moments notice. The reality is the 99% of day to day policing doesn't require a weapon. Due to strict anti gun laws in places like Britain most petty crimes are committed with out fire arms. 
I'm a British citizen, I live south of London in an area that is quite affluent but I have many friends who live in South London boroughs and throughout the city. One notable impact that unarmed police have to the UK is the level of animosity shown from people. It's understandable that a lot of young people who get into trouble show some anger at the police, but I've never seen or met anyone who's threatened violence against the police - maybe it's just my circumstance but since people are less threatened directly by the police, it doesn't foster the animosity that seems to be prevalent in the US.  

(again, just my personal view would be interested to see other interpretations)
Fuck all this "Anti gun vs Pro gun" shit in the comments.     
I'm Irish, I love that our police force are unarmed, and if you're worried about terorists in the country then welcome to 20 years ago. It's great when a country has no guns, I love it. But at the same time, I think that because America has a population filled with gun nuts it's going to be impossible to have them give it up, which also means it's going to be impossible to have unarmed police there.     
      
Now that I think about it, it's almost like we're different fucking countries with different fucking people and we should accept that and stop bitching about how we should run one another's countries. 
yeah we are good mate. if there is an armed situation we have plenty of armed police who come pretty quick. we don't want normal police killing our innocent citizens. the entry exam level is to low to give them guns/
There are still officers that carry firearms across London and the UK in various locations such as airports, stations and the business districts. We do not "shun guns", we just require those that carry them to be specially trained and then deploy these officers where/when they are required. In America every moron with a badge carries a pistol, hence the unacceptable amount of unlawful killings that occur each year.
Whether they are armed or not, the brit police by way of sir peel had/have it right:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_Principles
[This](http://i.imgur.com/wUKeulw.jpg) is why police in the UK don't need guns.
Even during the height of the IRA bombing campaign in England the Police didn’t carry weapons, it wouldn’t have made a difference even if they had and that was a threat from within the UK.

From what I have seen in the first Paris attack the Police that did have weapons where clearly outmatched in raw power, range and accuracy. 9mm pistols against AK-47 assault rifles and they failed to stop the attackers.

Also unless the officers armed with pistols happen to surprise the attackers the chances of them engaging them effectively aren't great. The majority of the killing was done in the recent attack was within the first ten minutes, not enough time for any Police force to respond in time, armed or not.

Lee Rigby’s (the solider hacked to death in London) killers where contained and later shot / wounded by highly trained armed Police who arrived promptly soon after the attack, of course his attackers did not flee but remained on the scene until the Police arrived before attempting to attack the officers.

UK Police have trained armed officers at major hubs like airports and railway stations, to train every officer in firearms would be a huge expense at a time Police budgets are shrinking. Also not every officer will be proficient at using a gun, what do you do in that case, take them off the streets?

You would be arming an entire force for a threat which to date has not managed to arrive on the streets on the UK (persons armed with assault weapons) due to the efforts of services like the Police, MI6 / Mi6 and the Nation Crime Agency. Yes I know that the attacks on 7/7 where terrorist attacks but again a Police officer with a gun would not have stopped those attackers, indeed armed officers actaully managed to shot dead a totally innocent civilian only days later on the London Underground.



To be honest I like the British police. In our schools we're taught that the police are friendly and respectful, indeed, the local Police constable often comes into primary school classrooms to teach kids about road safety and other things.


I don't want to live in a society where I'm actually afraid of the police, they should be shown as helpers, rather than the psychotic murderer figure that has become so prevalent in the US.
Met a retired Bobby from Manchester here in NYC. I asked him how many times he had to beat someone with his Billy club throughout his career. His answer. Never. 
As a British Citizen I would just like to say that I don't want everyday officers to carry guns. I think they are already extremely effective at doing their jobs without the use of firearms. 
Dear America, widespread usage of guns does not work. Your own statistics prove this you are more likely for your own child to shoot themselves in the head than protect yourself and family.

In addition British police do carry guns but only in specialist highly trained squads designed to deal with gun crime.  
Scot here. Guns can get tae fuck. 
*"There's a reason why we keep the police and military seperate. One exists to fight the enemies of the state, the other exists to protect the people. When the military and police become the same, the enemies of the state tend to become the people."*
"Still" as if there is some need. I'm sorry but I'm struggling to understand why anyone would suggest that Britain suddenly needs to arm the standard police officer because of a terrorist attack in another country, devastation it hasn't seen since World War II

We are fine, we have armed police if need be. Anyone who thinks introducing more guns into society is an imbecile
When I visited London most of the cops didn't guns, but some cops in front of some of the building across from parliament carry assault rifles. 

Shit hits the fan they can call back up with plenty of weapons.
As an American, the idea of unarmed cops seems completely insane, that would be suicide in the US because so many people have guns.  Then again, we also have a lot of unnecessary police shootings.  If the brits are able to effectively police and maintain order without guns good on them.
There are armed officers stationed at high risk locations in London: The Palace, Downing St., Scotland Yard, major stations etc.

Other than that, the armed response units are sufficient. 

Day-to-day policing here does not require deadly force given the very low rates of gun ownership and gun use in crime.
It has been proven repeatedly that carrying guns on their person is FAR FAR more dangerous for the officer than not. Officers should have access to weapons if there is a known dangerous situation, but carrying one around on their person automatically escalates any confrontation they end up in. Police officers are shot by their own weapons more than 10 times as often as they are shot by someone elses gun. 
I love this. I come from a country with police that are normally not armed. I remember when traveling to New York, several of the police I saw where heavily armed. I felt very nervous and unsafe. Don't fancy being around guns. I think they create to big distance between police and civilians.
In Glasgow, you don't even need police; just baggage handlers - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smeaton_(born_1976)
Honestly I love our police force. For the most part they're incredibly friendly and helpful people; I fear that increased spending cuts, privatisation of certain security aspects and the potential for them to have guns on the beat will just turn them into the stereotypical American thug cop.
I'm an American living in London and I love that there aren't armed cops everywhere...I find it crazy that I rarely actually see cops.  I was in Copenhagen during the Paris attacks.  I was there Thursday-Sunday and the only police I saw were at the airport.  So weird as an American...that being said there are plenty of armed cops in London now.  They aren't arming the whole force but I see machine guns most days at Victoria and some days in Green Park station.
And a bloody good thing too. I'm British and I'm completely happy with how our police work. Not saying they're perfect but I'm glad they're unarmed.
Yeah, good. I don't want our police to be armed, it changes the whole dynamic of policing &amp; makes criminals more dangerous.
Brit here. Just a quick reminder, one of the reasons our police aren't armed is because they can be just as fucked up, brutal, impulsive, racist and / or mentally ill as anyone else on the planet. 

I'm actually a big fan of the police. Have police buddies, most of the interactions I've had have been very positive. But don't make the mistake of thinking that because they don't have guns none of them are capable of being violent power abusing assholes. We have just as many bad eggs as any other country in the world. 
Good. I don't like change. Especially when it's change for all the wrong reasons.
Too bad the U.S didn't have this level of resolve.
The full story is that their bobbies may not be armed, but there are officers in quick response units that are HEAVILY armed close by that use military gear that even our own US police don't use. 

PLUS they also allow their military to assist quickly which we can't do unless national guard is authorized and even then it's a grey area with our constitution as to their role/duties.
As a foreigner who lived in the UK for seven years, I really appreciated the fact that it was a gun free society. It scares me to death in my own country at how easy it is to procure and own guns (legally and illegally). 

I hope these fucking terrorists never succeed in changing this gun free policy in the UK and this statement from the British Police gives me great relief.  
Well duh. Police don't have guns because citizens don't have guns, and when criminals get a hold of guns, SWAT handles the situation, not police.
We don't need all police to carry guns as we have one of the lowest violent crime rates in the world.  Part of that is because the police don't carry firearms, then most criminals do not feel the need to either.

Secondly, every area has an Armed Response Unit.  If an incident requires police with firearms, cars from that unit are there as quickly as any unit would be if all police officers were armed.

Finally(!) most high risk areas do have armed police on guard anyway.


Result: lower rate of violent crime, lower cost to tax payer, almost zero rate of non-justifiable civilian deaths from police firearms, high risk areas protected anyway.  That's a win/win/win/win situation.
There sure are some insanely immature posts being upvoted in these comments...
(Deep sigh) we as a country do not need our police to have guns, as Peel said when he invented the police; The police are here to protect the public not to control them. There is little or no gun crime in the uk especially when compared to other first world countries who have a 'free for all' attitude to a dangerous weapon. The UK armed police and army are among the worlds elite. I feel that im living in one of the safest countries in the world. The majority of citizens feel very protected, yes I personally did feel secure when our SAS were on patrol in London last week but that was purely due to their skills being second to none rather than a gun on their person. 
As a "radical American gun owner" I don't see the big fuss. Let the Brits run their own country. It really isn't any of our business.

Personally I love living in an armed society. I feel safer with my AR-15 next to my bed, and I like having the capability to protect myself. 

However, that doesn't mean what's right for us is right for others. If GB can maintain an effective police force and control crime without gun use then more power to them. It's not for me. I mean that literally; I have no vested interest in it and no moral authority to dictate one way or the other.

So in short, live and let live. If your system works and your crime rates are low then keep at it. I'm going to stay heavily armed, though.
As a UK citizen and ex-police officer, I completely agree. Police do NOT carry deadly weapons; the military kills, not the police.
Just to be clear, there are plenty of armed police in the UK, it's just that not every one of them has a gun.
The  Police can have an  heavily armed team to any location in minutes in UK https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearms_unit
 
London squad https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specialist_Firearms_Command


I think the lack of guns is one reason why the police and the public seem to get on fairly well in the UK.  I wouldn't feel very comfortable dealing with a police officer if they had the ability to end my life in a second if they chose to.
&gt; British police are proud of their history of policing “by consent” — the idea that police serve the people, not the state.

It's amazing how much of a difference this distinction makes. 
When the British says "we’re proud of that" That means, Fuck off! we're not adapting your shit way of dealing with things. 
ITT: Americans failing to understand why other countries wouldn't want to adopt their approach to guns
The British police enjoy the game of fistycuffs.
I live in London and I've never seen so many smiling, unarmed happy policemen as the last two days. Seriously, everywhere you go. Happy unarmed police smiling at babies, riding horses, checking old people are okay. Saying hello to people ... every 200 yards.


It's time everyone just accepted that Britain and USA are two different cultures. Obviously, Americans have a big gun culture and it's only really a minority who support banning guns. My dad was born in America with English parents, worked in the American Air Force and moved back to Britain. He and my mum hated the gun culture and the fact that their neighbours slept with guns under their pillows. To them it was crazy.

Here in Britain we just have a different culture. Knife crime is reasonably high, mostly in London but no one here is into guns and feels the need for them. The best thing about this country is our gun laws but i've realised that from visiting USA etc that the place is just completely different. 
The idea to up the armament of police officers, to protect them, must initially seem like a good idea to police representatives. However the mistaken assumption is that terrorists or criminals intent on attacking a police officer, would attack an armed police officer in the same manner they would attack an unarmed police officer. In other words the assumption appears to be that terrorists and criminals are stupid.

The US has some of the most heavily armed police officers anywhere. Yet police officers are not uncommonly killed by assailants. There's a simple reason for this. Human beings are intelligent. Someone who wants to attack a police officer will use different tactics with an armed police officer, than they would with an armed police officer. In other words if they believe the police officer is armed they will attempt to take them by surprise, or use some other tactic that prevents them using whatever they are armed with.

Any terrorist with a modicum of intelligence would be aware of the armament of police officers. If they think the police officer is armed, they will take them by surprise etc.

In reality if the police were universally armed with tasers, it would simply increase their use by police officers in inappropriate circumstances, and lead to an increase in people killed or injured by police tasers. Yet it would probably do little to protect a police officer from a determined terrorist attack, because enough police officers already carry tasers, for any semi-intelligent terrorist, to assume any police officer may be carrying one.

The French police are routinely armed, yet it did little to protect them from terrorists who were clearly aware of this, and prepared for it.

Despite British police officers being relatively unarmed, relatively few are killed in the line of duty. I don't see any evidence that police officer who are armed, suffer less attacks, or are less likely to be killed, than unarmed police officers.

Let's take an example like the horrific Lee Rigby murder. Say he had been armed. How would that have protected him
Britain, fuck yeah!
I'd rather have a police officer that I can interact with and not be afraid that they will shoot me on a daily basis.

When situations occur that require armed police, all British police forces have armed response teams with an average response time of under four minutes, and odds are that armed regular police would not have prevented said situation in the first place.

The armed forces use weapons to defend the people against their enemies. The police are there to serve the people. When you arm the police you are turning the people into the enemy.
I like the last part:

“Given the fact that the Paris attacks have shown that ISIS have not only the ambition but the capability of carrying out attacks on the streets of Europe, we have to adapt to that heightened terrorist threat,” she said, using an acronym for the Islamic State.

Isn't it kind of redundant to tell us she is using an acronym?  Why not mention she was speaking sentences as well?

Good for them. Most policing does not require firearms. 
It's the police *service*; "force" is too aggressive.
They're not even allowed to use harsh language.
Saying that i've seen armed police round london, tube stations and the such. So we aren't totally without an armed presence in key locations.
Whether they are armed or not, the brit police by way of sir peel had/have it right:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peelian_Principles
real surprised they don't have guns - in australia we have strict gun laws, but police officers still have handguns. 
Can't fool me Britain. I watched hot fuzz
American here.  Good fucking call.  No closing that Pandora's Box.
Giving any law enforcement officer a firearm without explicit training and understanding is a **very bad** idea. If the British police were to be given guns in retaliation to the Paris attacks, there would be serious problems.

In the event of an armed shooter in Britain, the current protocol is to escalate to officers who are trained in the use of guns. This is a lot safer for the regular police officers, who want to go back home to their families every night.

Giving untrained officers guns are like telling flight attendants to fly the plane if the pilot becomes unconscious.
How is it newsworthy that we don't want guns in our society?

As somebody who lives in the UK, it amazes me that you guys think we want them even a smidgen.
Cops carrying guns is actually pretty pointless. Just ends up as shootouts in the middle of populated streets. They still have special weapons teams. Not having a weapon makes sure the street officer calls for appropriate backup rather than trying to be a hero. I wish North American police did the same.
Bobbies, honestly, just look like pure class.
Sure, the cops here don't carry guns.

But they can sure as hell produce them when needed.
Brit here: We DO have armed police in certain cases. Just because we don't go shooting up schools, doesn't mean we don't have guns.
Someone who lived in the UK for 20 years.

Based on my experience police in the UK have just as many assholes as any other police force in the world, but as far as I know they are trained for deescalation of situations rather than neutralizing situations. One of the possible reasons is that they are unarmed.

For example, I've seen a situation where a 7ft tall body building monster was raging at some 5ft 4 police officer (on his own, no partner). I couldn't hear what was being said but the tall guy was losing it... just acting like he was going to hit the officer. Not once did the little dude back down, or even step back. He just kept his hands up, and open and calmly spoke to the dude the entire time. It eventually calmed down to a point where the larger man just went his own way and nothing escalated and no one got hurt. 

Had this been in the US, for example... I have no doubt that large man would have been tased or worse without even a second thought.
You gun-toting yanks, please just GTFO. We do not want the deplorable thuggery that is USA policing.
im proud of my police for that too 
I'd feel more scared of the police officers here if they had guns. British police are the friendliest and most helpful people ever. I admire what they do so much, and i am grateful for them not needing to take on the job of the military.
Correct me if wrong, I've always heard that the reason British police don't carry guns is because the population has very little access to them. If this is true, it makes complete sense for them to not carry guns. 
As a Brit: we have armed response units. It's just that regular police don't carry guns, thank god. 
Even if there were attacks planned for Britain, that's what the SAS is for, right? So it's not like the British in general don't have guns, they have just determined that their standard police forces don't require the use of them.

EDIT: punctuation
Yeah - and rightly so. We have FAR less gun related crime and/or deaths here in the British isles, because our (even petty) criminals don't feel the need to arm themselves to the teeth with assault rifles.

Maybe the rest of the world should jump on the logic-bandwagon so you can shut the fuck up complaining about people getting shot up left, right and centre 20 times a week.

Guns absolutely do not solve anything. If someone want's to fight - and the opponent has a gun, the person wanting a fight is not going to say... "Oh, I better not start a fight with that person." - They'll just bring a bigger gun.
Terrorist attacks are stopped by INTELLIGENCE, not armed police on every street.

Armed police are available if needed and that is the way it should remain.
As they should be, the UK is a much much safer place than places like the US because of the fact that the Police and the citizens evading arrest are not strapped to the teeth with fire arms. This is what safe, sane, and ethical gun policy looks like. In the very very few situations that require fire arms, they have units armed with them that they send out.
Bloody right too!
I can't see how arming the regular police force would even be a logical response.  The Paris attacks were responded primarily with france's version of SWAT, not your average cops on patrol. If a similar attack occurred in London, it would be met with the same response. The arms carried by the average London police officer in this scenario would be completely irrelevant, because they wouldn't be directly involved.
Meanwhile Norwegian police remain "temporarily armed" (it was supposed to end the same day as the attack in Paris happened, so it got emergency extended instead) and the number of accidental discharge of police guns have surpassed the amount of shots fired the last 5 years in a like 6 months... Just today a police woman was accidentally shot in the leg (thankfully the only injury so far). Frankly I feel more safe when our police is not carrying loaded guns...
Love all the opinions mainly from outside the UK stating how this was an open invitation for a terrorist attack, I remember distinctly growing up during some horrific IRA bombings who btw mainly got funding from the bars in Boston and NY but that's for another day.  

Terrorism is not a knew thing for us we will cope also having a routinely armed police like the French do does not make a blind bit of difference to people armed with automatic weapons and bombs.  

We have a relatively low gun crime problem, are on an island unlike Belgium and Marseille where a black market gun could be bought quite easily due to the saturation from the war in the Balkans and open borders.  This was really inevitable in France, less likely in the UK.  

Lastly we have many officers that are armed around sensitive areas and have ARU's on standby at all times so don't assume we are unprotected.  I for one still believe in 'policing by consent' and would resign forthwith if it became a requirement for all.  

And in Britain over 1000 people have not been killed by police this year either.
Where is the vid of the Black guy with a knife in London and 6 cops running from him?
Fuckers have mil-spec hardware in the trunk of patrol Rovers.  it's not far away.

Plus, have you seen those urban warfare Paddy wagons?

No offense to occupied Paddies.  :-)
We have armed units for when we need armed units. How useful will a bobby on the beat carrying a 9mm *really* be in a terrorist attack situation?

Rather than have every policeman carry a gun, we have *highly* trained units that we only break out when necessary.

Not to mention the fact that unarmed officers are far more approachable and relatable than those with a gun.
Guys the British police are so informal and friendly and your always see them dancing in carnivals, they are very lovable. My guess is that they aren't trained to fear everyone and shoot first then ask questions.
The metropolitan police have an armed division (SCO19) that is tasked with dealing with situations where firearms are being used by criminals.

But since the UK has strict gun control the regular constables don't need to carry a firearm for their daily duties. 
Frontline police with guns usually just kill civilians. For evidence, see the USA.
What a world we live in.

"Demilitarize the police! No, now give them guns! Way more guns! Wait, they shot somebody? Demilitarize the police!"
None of this even matters. Its all irrelevant. 

If you have an aggressor with a lethal weapon and he has a plan that nobody knows about, people will die. Period.

There is no way to prevent that. Thus, having guins does not help you.

The typical gun nut will say "Man if I was there and I was armed I woulda shot that guy right away and everything would have been fine"

Wrong.

If you were armed and a guy came in and randomly started firing, you would be hit before you ever got a shot off. The element of surprise is really important to planned attacks. Smart, planned aggressors account for the possibility of their victims being armed. 


The only time having a firearm is reasonably going to improve the situation is if the aggressor is unplanned- he is either drug or rage-addled and is exercising violence as an outlet. 

You know what else really helps with those situations though? Sanity, having a police presence which discourages irrational behavior, and talking.
Meanwhile, [in America](http://i.imgur.com/SZFlOIZ.jpg)
ITT: Americans with their mind blown.
No guns means you cannot shoot someone accidentally. I bet the Insurance is cheap
Here in Norway the police just started wearing guns all the time and we now have had up to 5 incidents where the guns have involuntarily gone off and fired shots....

They are supposed to be professionals and look like amateurs when handling firearms.. Just today a female officer misfired a glock in her holster. 

All this because of fear of a terrorist attack.... 
So far this year 1 English police officer was killed. He was run over during a car chase. 
So far this year over 27 America police officers have been shot and killed.

Even adjusting for population armed US police get killed more just from being shot.
[deleted]
We need to disarm our police in the USA.  This usually gets downvoted, but I will not stop saying it.
Even if they were swayed to start carrying gun like this, no sweeping legislation or regulation should ever be passed in the heat of the moment...
Well, considering that you are more likely to be killed by police than a terrorist in the US, I'd say the French are on the right path.  


[deleted]
I read this that the Brit police don't use stun guns...
Of course we don't see many armed police- but then we hardly ever seem to see police round my way. Just talking yesterday trying to remember when we last saw a policeman other than riding by in a car. Not even seen a PCSO for months.
...did arming police in France stop the French attacks?
This makes perfect sense. Standard cops walking around tooled up with SMG's and body armour don’t exactly come across as approachable to the public. All it does is alienate them from the people they are supposed to be policing; if people know their local plod and actually know a bit about them, they tend to have more respect and are more likely to talk to them about any dodgy shit in their neighbourhoods. Win-win situation. All UK fortces have armed units anyway, they don't require all cops to be armed.
Having American cops go unarmed would be a death sentence, you wouldn't even be able to get people to volunteer for the job regardless of pay. 

Yesterday down the street a convicted fellow had been running from the police, he turns around and pulls a gun out and starts dumping on the officers. Imagine if they were unarmed. Instead they shot him in the leg and now he will be in prison. 
Good.
Just an excuse to go have tea &amp; crumpets when something big happens and the military and other armed forces take over the job.
&gt; British police are proud of their history of policing “by consent” — the idea that police serve the people, not the state.

You know what, that is just beautiful.
just incase people in the USA think it's a bit weird.  we have an armed response unit that called on or deployed when the shit really hits the fan.  however, all regular police are unarmed
Why is this world news? Kinda obvious we wouldn't make an extreme change like that.  We didn't when when the IRA bombed us, why would we change our minds when France, who have guns anyway, was bombed? 
I wish the US police would realize that guns create the problem.

"Enforcing" peace with a gun is like cleaning the air by lighting up a cigarette.
A very strong-willed, admirable stance to take when they could've gone full, ignorant Islamophobe, started amassing any weapon they could get their hands on and turned into a militant harassment corps like parts of the police force here in the US of A.
My dad was a officer for a good 30 years and was never in a situation whee a gun would be needed. Admittedly its a pretty remote area, but because of the really restricted firearm access the only major incidents involve knifes (or in one case two officers were attacks with power tools) and armed police from about 30 minutes away are called out to respond if nessocary. The power tool incident ended in a "siege" with firearm officers, but there were definitely no shots fired (wouldn't even surprise me if their safety was still on). I know there are some gun incidents in cities like London and Manchester but in major cities armed units are not too far away. 

All the officers I've met would never use a gun, even if they had them on them because it goes against that they believe policing should be, but obviously in places like America opinions differ.
Police not having guns doesn't mean there aren't any other forces with tons of weapons to deal with serious situations.
Average police do not need guns, I've grown up in some rough areas and not once have I seen one gun, it's really hard to get them and if the police armed themselves then the criminals will too. In Britain it's mostly knife crime compared to guns, don't arm the police. It's not America where all criminals have guns too, there are special task teams within the police who are armed and ready to deal with terrorists.
I feel like the issue is less that American police carry guns and more how willing they are to use them in situations that don't really warrant it. If the guns stayed in the holster until and unless the officer was prepared to fire that would be preferably to pulling them out "just in case" or as intimidation. 
I would rather risk being killed by terrorists(a very small risk) than being killed by police by mistake. I am asian and look like terrorist probably. lol.

It makes sense for american police to carry guns. Uk is however does not have much gun crime, arming all police force(against their will) will solve no problem. The way vital places like parliament and airports are guarded with armed police is sufficient response to terror threat.
But we do have armed police in the UK. We've got specially trained armed response units and regular police have tasers. 

It's not so surprising that our police very rarely, if ever, kill anyone - but they still get the job done. 

I wouldn't be surprised that our forces could capture and take in a terrorist for questioning, which seems to be an impossibility elsewhere. Everyone else seems to snuff them out far too early.
Ah, looks like our police force aren't the only ones who discriminate? 
The guys in the poofy hats carry rifles though.
Terrorist attacks are kinda different from day-to-day police work...
Let's assign everyone a personal drone that follows them around at all times to make sure they're not plotting anything malicious, upload it all to youtube for us to watch each other, then everybody get's paid off youtube views. When you masturbate or the drone catches you having sex, it beeps like r2d2 when he likes something to let you know you've switched to streaming to pornhub. Joblessness, terrorism, recession, the decline in the porn industry, all solved in one neat idea. You're welcome.
It's cute seeing people talk about this as though this is a decision they just made and like they've never dealt with terrorism before. 
After seeing how many fatalities occur in the states stemming from the polices use of guns, I'm glad to live in England.

Thanks to our strict gun laws, there aren't lunatics with easy access to guns in every city right down to the small towns; so our police obviously don't have to carry equal force.

The number of deaths resulting from putting a gun in the hands of every police man and woman would definitely outweigh the number of lives that could have been saved if they had guns and didn't have to rely on calling in special armed units. So personally I don't see the need for it either 
this is only true to an extent. the visible force might remain unarmed but go into central london any day of the week and wander down the side streets (eg: from green park/belgravia to soho). there are vans of police with semi autos parked up. shit's real and since paris it def feels like a step up on the usual.
[... But, literally, one of the most memorably images London evokes ...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Guard)

Sure, it's technically not the police, but ...
If my police force all had guns. I'd sort out my shotgun licence. 


If you come to London it's not uncommon at train stations, big events and places people congregate to see police carrying an H&amp;K MP5 submachine gun on patrol in pairs. Also if you see a red police car it's full of machine guns, pistols and shotguns, they're the DPG (diplomatic protection group). It's just the bobby on the beat who isn't 'armed', through they all still have CS gas, a taser and a retractable metal bar to beat you with. It's just that the armed ones we make sure are incredibly highly trained, which is why we have so few police related deaths. Whenever someone is accidentally killed by police it's a massive story here and it happens so infrequently i can only think of 2 off the top of my head. If you're walking around in public with a live machine gun we want you to have specialist training coming out of your arse. In America any old moron can join the police and your gun is one of the first things you're given. It's no wonder they're going around murdering people and killing dogs.
Did not British cop shoot a Brazilian mistaking him as terrorist after London terrorist attacks?
[the worst they got in england is drive-by arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R6_Chr2vro)
*Service. Force is too aggressive.
Afaik here in Spain most if not all policemen carry handguns, and although the National Police Force is not very well regarded by the public (mainly because of police brutality in demonstrations), they are not known for shooting anyone they shouldn't have. So in our case I don't think there's anything wrong with having a handgun there just in case.
Good for them, guns shouldn't be seen as a force for harm. 

As an american public; I hope that the majority can stop looking at guns as an all powerful tool that can kill anyone, and more as a deterrent.

Yes, guns COULD kill anyone. 
Does that mean we should power trip if we have them though?

Absolutly not!



as an american I'm also proud of you guys not needing guns. 
While this is true, when I flew into London there were soldiers/cops/whatever all over the place with sub machine guns.  Maybe they weren't "police", but they were some type of para-military force, and they were quite prominent.  It's not like if something like what happened in Paris happened in London, you wouldn't have a bunch of bobbies storming into action with batons raised... 
We certainly are proud of that. I have utmost respect for our police, they are professional and I have no fear of them. If there's a situation where a gun is actually needed, they are there within minutes. 

Equip our beat officers with guns, and the criminals will follow suit. No thank you. 
Good job Britain. Everyone should take example.
Would be better if they had guns like we do in the US so they could just shoot innocent people like we do in the US. And if they had so many guns like we do in the US there wouldn't be any crimes, just look at the US!
And American cops want tanks and assault rifles as every day gear. Sad. I wonder how many times in the average police officers career they are shot at or even deal with a firearm related crime. 
As an American, this makes me happy.  Here's why:

It's been 14 years since 9/11, and the terrorists certainly did more damage than just towers and mass murder:  We've started wars, spent trillions, enabled ridiculous TSA procedures that require little old ladies to take their shoes off... We've given up freedoms and set up precedents for a Brave New World style future.  Even our police forces look like damn militia and they squelch peaceful protests with terrifying force.  Fucking hell.

God forbid the British make the same mistakes we did.
Good.
You guys are morons!

Here in the US our well armed citizens have stopped literally zeroes of terrorist attacks and mass shootings!

(Please don't ask how many mass shootings and terrorist attacks our weapons have actually been used for...)
Meanwhile in America where we are all gung ho about our guns we're too scared to take any refugees, shows you who has the balls in the world.
Aww man, America, will you please stay out of Britains business with their guns? We know you love yours, and cold dead fingers and all that, but it works for them, so fuck off cunts.
Armed French police didn't prevent the Paris attack
I once saw an armed Policeman buying his dinner in Tesco. So they do exist.
My sense is that firearms officers are more commonly seen on the streets, in London anyway. Most large train stations will have guys with assault rifles wandering about casually.  Also some of the unarmed offices you might see may have firearms in their vehicles they have to request permission to carry in response to an incident. This was the case a few years back anyway. I don't think of the uk force as unarmed just less visibly armed.
Icelandic police want guns. Icelandic police. Want. Guns. In. Iceland. Where there are almost no crimes. Because of terrorists.
The British Police do not 'shun' guns. One unit, SCO19, indeed carry guns. And you know if they turn up they are willing, able and VERY ACCURATE with them. They do not shoot to incapacitate. You give the fuck up or get shot. THAT is an effective deterrent. Normal UK police are a peace keeping force and damned good at it.
I'm proud.
The volume of violent gun crime in the uk is so low that putting guns into the hands of beat police would actually increase the number of gun crimes as there would be a chance of stealing the gun from an officer. 
If I am a terrorist, this would be my invitation. With an AK 47, An am mature gunman can pick off dozens of unarmed populace before their swat team arrives. 
I'm not even very conservative but I'd accept a world where everyone had a gun. Obviously stupidity would result in accidents, but whatever. Doesn't bother me. 
&gt;British police are proud of their history of policing “by consent” — the idea that police serve the people, not the state.

Too bloody right.
Fuck guns and the monsters that wield them.
Britain has been fine with unarmed police officers, there should be a clear distinction between a person who keeps civil order and who deals escalated situations.
Both my parents were police officers in Australia. They were members of the Australian Federal Police. I think the attitude the police in Australia is the attitude every officer should have worldwide. Police in Australia are trained to shoot to kill only. Never to injure or slow down a criminal. They use hollow point ammunition too. However they only ever draw their weapon if their lives or another life is in danger. If a cop in Australia pulls their pistol on you there is a good chance you're going to die. I am on my phone at the moment buy I will get some stats later to back this claim up but I'm certain police fire their guns far less in Australia because of the training and their attitude towards using their weapons. 
Why would they? This isn't the first terrorist attack to happen in the world. Nothing has changed.
French police literally patrol the eiffel tower with automatic weapons... Didn't seem to save any lives
I wish this was the case in Australia. Our police model themselves on the US unfortunately

What's the alternative? America? NO THANKS!!!!!
Having guns incentivises the use of guns by criminals. We don't let that happen because we're not stupid. My opinion. 
smug factor 10,000
I love the police over here but carrying a hardened steel collapsable asp baton is not 'unarmed' in my book, but they are designed to incapacitate unlike a gun, so it sits okay with me
It boggles my mind that people actually believe concealed carry can prevent terrorist attacks. Like... really?
I've been a law enforcement officer for over 20 years and teach criminal justice courses to college juniors and seniors, have served on a SWAT type unit in one of the largest cities in the U.S. and also teach at the police academy.  British police have been able to conduct policework effectively for many years without a firearm on every belt for several reasons.  Traditionally, even when guns were more available, Britain was not a "gun culture" and overall ownership was low per-capita.  Nations like the United States or Switzerland where firearms ownership is very prevalent are two (albeit quite different in their own right) examples of gun culture.  Britain was a homogeneous society for many years and homogeneous European societies have had traditionally lower crime rates and a "like-mindedness" of social norms, values and the like.  As things change with the introduction of ethnic diversity, so crime and other social problems change with it.  That is an irrefutable fact that has been demonstrated with numerous societies on both a national, regional and even city level.  British society will need to examine their policing polices and take into account societal changes, crime occurrence trends and the evolution of the types of crimes they are seeing as they undergo these changes.  One thing that does not help clarify the subject and help determine a good course of action is results based analysis of the clearance (how a criminal act was ultimately resolved) of a crime.  That means everything from robbery to a terror attack.  Results based analysis in these types of situations tend to be what I call the:  "Everything worked out okay in the end" policy.  When we see a situation like the Paris attacks, it can be easy to say that the specialized task force units ultimately ended the situations and the average armed cop had a negligible effect.  That is forming an opinion with results based analysis.  While it is true that the Paris attacks were ultimately resolved with specialized task force style units, the average armed beat cop in Paris had a lot to do with containing some of the situations.  As an example, there is ample footage of street cops with pistols and shotguns exchanging fire with the suspects on the street behind the Bataclan Theater.  If the terrorists were attempting to mobilize and escape to cause mayhem somewhere else, it was those cops that prevented that from happening and not the task force units.  The terrorists stayed to fight with the police and were prevented from expending their ammo and detonating their suicide vests in some other location.   

When we look at the Charlie Hebdo situation, two armed officers were killed by the gunman.  One of them executed while lying wounded in the street.  The next day another officer, this one unarmed, was killed while her unarmed partner hid himself, unable to help her.   In looking at this we see that an officer can be killed whether they have a firearm or not.  These results do not argue that carrying a gun is ineffective.  Rather, they show us that even though a cop can die armed or unarmed, the presence of a gun can affect the unfolding of the situation.  In the immediate aftermath of the office attack, the suspects were forced to deal with the armed officer on the street.  It slowed their escape and they were not able to clear the area as they had intended.  They dismounted their vehicle and killed the officer.  They also drove off the unarmed officers that were behind him.  Had those officers been armed, they had a good chance to keep the suspects contained.  Hence, the reason why the French now have more armed officers on the street and those officers were a welcome addition during the events of 11/13.  Keeping them contained and busy fighting the police fixes them to a spot where you can bring down your muscle.  This is a basic combat tactic.  Fix the enemy with force and bring in superior force to crush them.  Preferably from another direction.  You want to disrupt them and make them react to you.  This is called seizing the initiative or commanding the battle space.  These suspects were able to escape to fight again with officers the next day and place hundreds at risk during a highway gun battle and later a siege.  The unarmed officers the following day were in a position to meet force with force, but since neither of them was armed to fight back, the suspect was able to escape and take hostages at a food market later that day, placing more people at risk.  Amedy Coulibaly, one of the terrorists said in his martyrdom video that their  goal was to kill the newspaper staff to send a message and then kill police officers.  Their intention was to leave the scene of the attack and then return later to kill responders or kill police at another location once things calmed down.  This is a tactic that law enforcement around the United States is preparing for.  It will not be a surprise when it happens.  British police know this as well.  How they respond to it is their prerogative.  The French responded by dramatically increasing the number of armed officers and stepping up training (some of the units at the Bataclan had been training that morning).  These extra armed officers certainly were a welcome sight to their embattled cohorts at the Bataclan and likely a welcome sight to the people trying to get away from the mayhem.  Their presence did nothing to hamper the situation.  The French chose to take a performance based, rather than a results based approach to analyzing their response to the Charlie Hebdo attacks.  They found that performance to be in need of improvement and took steps to make it happen.  They recognized that having more armed police on the street gave them a greater chance of taking the initiative and disrupting an attack.  The British are taking a results based approach of:  "Everything has been okay so far and we see no need to change".  In my opinion as an experienced law enforcement officer and trainer, they are making a mistake by not looking at the French situation and increasing their armed presence.

Lastly, just about any police officer will tell you that the phrase "It's going to take guys getting killed before this policy changes" is not exactly uncommon.  Institutional inbreeding tends to stymie bureaucratic organizations.  "We've always done it this way" is a perfect example of that and the crux of the matter is whether the leadership knows when to change.  Sadly, the former statement often has to come true before it does.  

Edit:  clarity, syntax

Who said you need guns to grant democracy? such a dumb fallacy... 
an American cop like just shot and killed an unarmed person in a wheelchair... I'm pretty happy we don't have guns
In the UK airport police look like [this](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/11/1/1288644551730/Armed-police-at-Gatwick-005.jpg) in Ireland airport police look like [this](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/60/182292215_a05cc17f9d.jpg)
Good for them. No need to be carrying guns all the time.
It's one of the things about my country that I am proud of. Our police are unarmed and I hope they remain that way.
Good
That's great. We should start phasing out having the police carry guns in the US as well.
Let's not forget that it was guns that stopped the 2 terrorists in Texas.

The cops in Belfast carry guns. But Belfast will never be hit by Muslim terrorists. That's because the Muslims know that the Republican and loyalist paramilitaries would walk arm in arm as they shot everything Muslim in sight.
Quite a contrast with US police, who need AR-15s and SWAT teams whenever a kindergartener throws Jello at them.
If the cops don't have firearms,  the crooks don't need firearms... 
This is a great idea, but for some countries it is not an option.  In England, you have your forces spread out over an area the size of Alabama or Iowa.  In the US, Russia, China, etc... How do you keep highly trained special forces paid, and on call, covering an area 40+ times larger with 1/5th the population density?
Britian's police system is catered towards Britain. America's police system is catered to America. Entry level police being unarmed would be nice, but in America, with an almost 1:1 ratio of guns to people, police need to be armed to deal with things. Britian doesn't have that problem. Good for them!
I am so pleased that our police officers don't carry guns. I fell it makes for a much safer society.
We have special units trained with guns that drive around alot and get called out to situations when needed.like when those guys cut lee rigbys head off. So there not really required for all feds
It should be noted that throughout "in the troubles" they were not armed either. There are armed units but your average cop in the street doesn't carry a gun.
I applaud this. 
Well its not like we don't have armed units in the UK.  They're just not necessary in most policing situations.
They have the freedom to choose that lifestyle, and they seem to be alright with that.  Let them do whatever they choose too..
Good.
You're all fucking morons, guns = people get shot and die 
I couldn't imagine going to work without my gun. An officer close to me was just killed leaving work. It must be nice to not need them.
I'm sick of non Americans commenting on our gun politics. You don't live here. 
*What?!*

According to the gun-tards in the US, you can't even leave your house if you aren't packing more heat then a small 3rd world country.  How can these UK law enforcers *possibly* do their job of fighting crime without a gun?!?

... oh, that's right, because they're not pussies.
As an American, I don't understand how this works. How do they kill suspects?
I wonder if they said the same thing in 2013, when British Soldier Lee Rigby was beheaded in broad daylight on a london street, while onlookers and police watched. It's truly sad to see them say something like this. I am glad I live in the United States, a country that is not so scared of guns.
That will make it a lot easier for terrorists. They won't have to worry about the police shooting back. 
Aye you can drop your plans for mass surveillance while you're at it you fucking creeps you have ample power already. 
We don't have shootings though. The reason for a Paris or Charlie Hebdo to happen here is unlikely is because smuggling the guns in is harder you can't just walk over the border.
It is kinda funny the guns displayed on time's page are all air rifles. 
When you talk to people from parts of Brazil or Mexico that live in areas basically run buy Cartels with illegal weapons, that have zero or massively corrupt police support, they tend to be in favor of the right to bear arms.

 "allows citizens to buy nine guns and 600 rounds of ammunition a year"

What kind of ratio is that?
Hey, Brazilian here. Just letting you guys know, this is one of the things that will not happen anytime soon, it's nothing else than the intentions of someone. 

It's not even being talked about much. Probably just someone trying to gather votes from people with the same opinion.

This article is like the NASA plans and estimations articles.
Hopefully they'll get better guns than Taurus'
&gt;The draft law is the latest move by what has been dubbed by opponents as the **Bullets, Beef and Bible Caucus** in Brazil’s congress. Politicians linked to the security services, big agricultural firms and evangelical Christians consolidated their power in last year’s elections and have advanced a series of conservative measures.

Wow, they really do want to be like us.  
Brazilian here. 

The only people in Brazil who does not have guns is the general population.   


Criminals? Armed to the teeth.  
Corrupt police? Ditto.    

It is PAST time to allow people to defend themselves. If you wait for the state to do it, you are already dead. 

BTW: When I say that criminals are armed to the teeth, I am not talking about pistols and shotguns. I am talking about AK-47s, AR-15s, FALs, MP5s and even RPGs.  

Most of those are either smuggled in or  provided by army recruits in exchange for drugs. 


Edit: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger.

"An armed society is a polite society" they are about to put that to the test. 
Reddit will circlejerk the result either way it turns out.
Might get buried, but [this](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=dc3_1447219045) happened in Brazil's biggest city. Robbers with automatic weapons (obviously not legally acquired), while the law-abiding citizens have a really hard time trying to legally own pistols or .22 semi-autos at most. 
Dilma Rousseff will veto it, I think.
Not sure what I'm reading in these comments... Are American Redditors... fans of the second amendment?

Just surprised
"This might lead the the Wild West".

That's kind of the point. The Wild West had a murder rate of about 1 per 100,000.
American here, also permanent resident of Brazil. First let me stress that most Americans cannot conceive the amount of violence, crime and petty nonsense that goes on here. It really is strange that people have to live with such violent, rude and careless people, and have their government do so little. Before I really give my opinion on this please let me describe how and why I came to believe what I do. 

Criminals have all the guns. Police have some, but they don't seem to confront criminals or gangs. We, the people, are the victims. Simple, but please keep reading. 

The biggest problem in my city (I do not live in a giant metropolis, but rather an average sized city in the state of São Paulo) is the incredible amount of roving youths that amass in the blink of an eye. Often they come from poor neighborhoods and chill out in some of the city's more important areas- supermarket, mall, bus station. Now, they do generally create a lot of commotion and are quite disrespectful. Think mall rats, yet somewhat more confrontational. However, I've never encountered one of them with a gun. These kids are usually poor as hell (you can tell this based on the fact they take the bus heading to their impoverished neighborhood) with nothing to lose. I would not want one of them with a gun, whether given to them by a gangbanger or stolen from their parents who obtained it legally (if this law becomes reality). Street kids + poverty + weapons + trying to act cool in front of a girl (remember, they are kids who still think like kids) = chaos. Yes, I would feel safer with a concealed weapon. 

Secondly, THERE IS NO POLICE PRESENCE IN BRAZIL!  I needed caps here because I cannot stress this enough. You may see on the news police swarming a favela, but that's such a small portion of Brazil. In the US, we have police patrols on foot, by horse, motorcycle, car everything. Here, not the case. I have seen one traffic stop in my life here. I have never seen police interacting with the public to create goodwill. Most brazilians dislike the police and it's obvious why- they seemingly do little to inhibit crime, are notorious for corruption, and they generally seem indifferent and unhelpful. I posit that an increased police presence would go very far in reducing crime. I mean, when you have routine assaults on buses, youths smoking dope on the sidewalks in plain view of passerbys, and street gangs that have no problem robbing you as you walk home from a day at work, yeah, a police presence would help. And so would the right to have a gun. 

BUT, Brazil is also the most bureaucratic, often confusing country I've been to. Would I trust the politicians to write gun legislation that kept guns away from convicts? Or the insane? Or people who have shown to be socially unstable? Huehue, no! This is the same country that allows some prisoners to visit home for Christmas. 

And by the way, if you think I'm being insensitive to Brazilian culture or people, please understand that virtually every Brazilian I know agrees with me, and they all look at the USA as a model nation, and wish Brazil was more like America. Hell, many Brazilians have laughed in my face when I told them I chose to live here because of my wife's school and career. We'll move back to the US in a few years I estimate. 

TLDR- Guns would help avoid crime and prevent small time crooks from taking advantage of you, but Brazil's bureaucracy makes it virtually impossible to implement gun legislation that wouldn't lead to more deaths at the hands of people who shouldn't be permitted to have guns to begin with. 
The "right to defend themselves" and "criminals are already armed here" are kind of sound arguments, but people seem to completely ignore the side-effects of this bill in Brazil. Our reality is very different from the US.

More than 50% of the women killed in here die by the hands of familiars inside their homes (actual data from our "map of violence" - official data from the government). 

More than 110 people die from firearms in Brazil PER DAY. Homicides are the cause of death for **more than HALF** of teenagers between 16 an 18 years old in Brazil (and they won't have the right to  use firearms to "defend themselves").

Those are just a couple examples, but there is a lot more. Brazil also beats records in homicides of black people and homosexuals.

The numbers are even more scary when you classify the victims by wealthy. Note that poor people won't have access to firearms anyway, since it'll be ridiculously expensive.

Another repercussion would be the increase in number of suicides.

People are trying to emulate the US reality in Brazil, but you can't even imagine how our country is in terms of violence. This shithole is the world champion in domestic violence. Women, children and the elderly are slaughtered inside their homes. Now imagine how that'd go with guns. The average victim in Brazil is a poor teenager, and he will still be unarmed.
It will be fascinating to see what effect this has on the rule of law.  Corruption in law enforcement is so incredibly difficult to deal with.
As if the criminals will turn in their weapons. I'd be furious if I were a Brazilian reading this. 

"Collective security over individual security", fuck that guy. I hope the Brazilians prevail. I have family in a country with a similar problem of bandits running rampant. There's no room for bleeding hearts when the thugs kill hard working people in cold blood for their wallets. 
/r/watchpeopledie video count set to skyrocket
Exactly, the moment the police force becomes even mildly corrupt the average citizen is royally fucked in a state where they aren't allowed the means to defend themselves.
Might as well try something new, the current methodology isn't going very well. Fingers crossed. 
&gt; We need to disarm the bandits not arm the people”

Isn't that the whole point of gun control? Doesn't seem to be working for them so far. There will always be "bandits" with guns whether you ban them from private ownership or not. That's just how it is. I say give the Brazilians the right to bear arms in a similar fashion to the U.S. Let the law be for say 10 to 15 years and then evaluate the situation. That's not nearly enough time to really get an understanding of the effects of it but it's probably the best that they could do without them scrapping it all together, or radically changing it that makes it useless.
At first I thought, "I'm sure this'll go well," but honestly, Brazil's gun violence couldn't possibly get any worse short of a literal war breaking out.
&gt; Among the other laws being debated are a plan to lower the age of criminal responsibility to 16; narrow the country’s robust definition of slave labor; weaken indigenous tribes’ right to claim their ancestral lands; exclude homosexual couples from the definition of family; and criminalize abortion in cases of rape.

Please note the context of what is happening, and then think again if it is really a good idea.
https://homemadeguns.wordpress.com/

A lot of these pictures - especially the submachine guns - are from Brazil. Obviously keeping them out of "the wrong hands" has failed. May as well let "the right hands" have a shot at it. 
"Gun culture".  So biased, they couldn't even make it through the headline.
Fun Brazilian fact: gun laws were much more permissive back in mid 90's.

Since then, besides strict laws about guns, education and income have improved substantially, inequality and poverty have gone down a lot aswell. The perfect scenario for reduction in violence, according to liberal propaganda

Guess what happened since then? Violence exploded in Brazil.
What is happening to reddit, how did this make the front page? did all the liberals go offline or something?
Also a brazillian here. 

      I think it's important to know that weapons aren't forbidden in Brazil, just the right to bear arms is restricted to police and military. At the moment, bearing a firearm ilegally is a non-bailable crime, and allowing people to walk around wouldn't make the streets safer, since very few honest people would want to carry them, making it very easy for criminals to walk around carrying guns, with no sentences for getting caught.

      Although many people in this thread might support it, I believe most of the brazillian population doesn't feel sympathetic towards guns, and the law isn't the only thing stoping everyone from having them. If the restriction was diminished, most people wouldn't go buy one, otherwise they would have already done so. Reducing the requirements to show aptitude would make access to weapons easier mostly to those who want to use them ilegally.

      Also, the suggested changes aren't very good either:

- Reducing the required age to buy a gun from 25 to 21 years: Most criminals are young, and facilitating access to guns for them isn't a big advantage.

- Alowing people to own nine guns: In no way necessary for self defense.

- Facilitating the process of acquiring a gun: Allows mentally unstable or untrained people to get them.

      Trying to give the population the task of defending themselves because the police is corrupted is just an easier alternative to ending police corruption. These easy alternatives are a common practice in Brazil and they need to stop. In this case, data from the US already shows that [higher gun ownership rates lead only to higher violent crime rates](http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797%2815%2900072-0/abstract), and the last thing we need is even more crime.
If it was copied from the U.S. Gun rights model, it would be a right for the purpose of defense from a tyrannical government.
What could possibly go wrong?
jimmies getting rustled up in here
It is kind of amusing the guns showed on Time's page are all Air Rifles.
It would be nice if Maryland would copy America's gun culture.
We're sitting ducks around here.
Protecting people by making weapons more available never really struck me as especially efficient
Brazilians don't primarily speak English, but you guys are a lot like us. 

Oh Brazil, why did you ever drop [the best flag you've ever had](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/23/Flag_of_Brazil_15-19_November.svg/1280px-Flag_of_Brazil_15-19_November.svg.png) 

We could've been like two brothers, splitting this hemisphere in twain, ruling the world with our stars and stripes. 
the gun-control debate in the US has now fallen flat on its face.
This is the experiment we need in the gun control debate, Brazil has gotten into a critical point, no amount of gun control worked, now they get it, they're taking an experimental way, hopefully it works out and people will see how it goes.

However, there's certain problems, muggers in Brazil are brutal and when I mean brutal is they're the kind of people who shoot you if you don't give them your wallet fast enough, they might not thinki twice about shooting people if they know they're carrying a concealed weapons.

Now, what I do expect, positively, is that house robberies will probably go down and communities that used to be helpless now will be powerful, it's like in Texas, would you rob a house there knowing the inhabitants can shoot you even if you are unarmed, the fuck no. 
In a lawless environment, firearms are the great equalizer. This permits women, the elderly, and those with disabilities an opportunity to defend themselves.  In 1987, I was "ranked" in Black Belt Magazine, and on top of the world.  

A few years ago, a drug dealer put a gun to the head of my son.  I am now disabled, 1987 was a long time ago.  

I purchased my first firearm, and put that son of a bitch in the back of a police cruiser.  

My family is alive because I had access to the means to defend myself and those I love.  

It wasn't the Black Belt I will never wear again.  It was the 12 gauge shotgun.  
I live in MA and it's hard as fuck to get a gun let alone a concealed carry permit 
This title is utter bullshit and I'll explain why I think that.

In Brazil most calibers are restricted only to military use. Brazilians can't have 9mm, .40, .45, nothing. Only guns in .22, .32 and .380 basically, so low powered weapons. Max muzzle energy must be under 407 Joules or in freedom units 300 foot-pound.

No assault weapons, no scopes, no silencers, no nothing. Just very small caliber pistols, and some low power rifles.

If you want a gun, you will have to register both yourself and the gun in a federal database, will have to have 21 years (I think they might still alter it to 25 years), go through extensive training, go through psychological evaluation, background check, pay a fuckton of money (at least a thousand dollars, which is a lot of money here) and wait a good amount of time.  

After that you get a ridiculous maximum amount of  2 pistols and 100 rounds per gun per year. You could have additionally other 4 long weapons, two with rifling and two without, but nobody is going around with a low powered bolt action rifle for self-defense in the middle of Rio de Janeiro...

And I haven't mentioned it yet, but you can't even carry the gun! This needs a separate permit, even more difficult to get. What I've been talking about is to have a gun home, and **never** take it anywhere unless you are a registered sportive shooter or have a previous permission from the police to carry it disassembled on that day in a determined path.

Common, it's nothing out of the regular, it's probably more restrict than anywhere in the US and on par with a few other places in the world.

How is this "U.S. gun culture"? We live in a country with continental dimensions, where the police can't even start to cover the most rural and isolated areas, and we have 55 thousand homicides per year. Having SOME kind of leeway with gun laws, as restricted as it is now, is not gun culture, it's being reasonable. 

Also, illegal guns get here EASILY, of all kinds and calibers. AK-47? Easy. FN FAL? They steal it from Bolivian Army and sell here, no prob. Uzi? I've been robbed with one of those... 

Loosing a little the restriction on legal guns won't change crime statistics for worse, as prohibiting them back in the 90s didn't make it better. Who wants guns for criminal purposes gets them far easier and more anonymously in any favela or in Paraguay. 

"Last year Brazil recorded 58,497 murders, a rate of 28.8 per 100,000 people. By comparison, the U.S. recorded 14,249, a rate of 4.5."

But the progressives keep calling for Americans to give up their rights and give up their firearms. I say no. It's obvious. Murder rate has nothing to do with gun availability. It has everything to do with the economy, education, and culture.
Self preservation is one of human kind's most primal instinct. It's only right for a human to have the desire to defend themselves or their family. It's seriously ignorant to think that your government is pure and has your best interest in mind. Take your life into your own hands. Good for Brazil. This is definitely a step forward.
/r/watchpeopledie

NSFW: 35 percent of the videos are people getting killed in Brazil, on average. 
Alright Brazil!
As an American, I shed a joyful tear of Freedom for Brazil. So beautiful.
This is really hard to call a good or bad thing - on one hand there's the very simple tendency for more guns in more hands leading to more gun violence in places that are already a little (or very) violent.

On the other hand Brazil is much closer to actual lawlessness with criminal gangs being significantly powerful and threatening - an armed populace *could* make their members more cautious, subtle, and possibly less overtly violent. (A decent example are the autodefensas of Mexico)
Talk about learning the wrong lessons.  There's always someone who thinks the best way to put out a fire is to drown it in gasoline.
The misleading title of this post is just delicious.  To suggest that Brazil is copying the US by "allowing" citizens to arm themselves... In the US, the government does not "allow" us to arm ourselves.  It is a foregone conclusion that self defense is a right granted by our makes.  Our Constitution simply forbids the government from interfering in that right.  It's not a blessing bestowed upon us by elected officials.   Also, calling firearm ownership a "gun culture" insinuates that firearm owners are some kind of cult.  Gun ownership is what founded this country.  It's how our fathers took it and built it.  It has always existed in the US.  We didn't petition the kings troops, we shot them.  Just because people chose to abandon their rights in favor of having others provide their protection is no reason to insinuate that gun owners are part of a cult.  I could go on, but I'm sure I'm wasting my time.
"God didn't make men equal, Mr. Colt did."
As an American I welcome the future - I imagine a time when Brazil will overtake America as the loud, obnoxious, gun-crazy people the rest of civilization complain about.
I'm Peruvian, and this means a shitload of cheap illegal guns will soon be hitting the black market. 

...not really thrilled with that idea.
Prepare yourself for liberal outrage.
It's ironic how much the anti-gunners in Brazil sound like the anti-gunners in the USA, mouthing the same, hoary wording, about "the wild west" if law-abiding Brazilians can have a gun to defend themselves.
&gt; allow embattled citizens the right to defend themselves from criminals armed with illegal weapons

...

&gt; removes a ban on those under criminal investigation owning or carrying weapons

Year 2020: Someone's spreadsheet shows a drop in crimes involving illegal weapons. Success!
The sentiment in Brazil earlier at the turn of the century is very different that it is now. Now, it's a common occurrence to see underage children who are stealing, being beat by crowds of adults in an attempt at vigilante justice. Back in the earlier 2000's something like this wasn't common, however people there are frustrated with the laws. No minor, no matter what crime was committed, can be put in jail/prison. These law were made because during the dictatorship many children of influential people were taken, often for BS in order to use them as bargaining chips.  In addition, under statutory law, adults in Brazil cannot be imprisoned for more than 30 years. This means that someone there could murder the president, massacre a school, set off a bomb, etc, and there max prion sentence would only be 30 years. It's a broken, outdated system, and the frustration/tension is only building up.
edit: A majority of people I know who live there, all would like the ability to purchase a firearm in an attempt to protect themselves, because popular opinion is that the police don't so much to protect people. There is a saying in Brazil: "Police officers by day, thug at night".
Kind of interested to see what happens if I'm honest.
Well, based on what I've seen on r/watchpeopledie, I don't see the harm in allowing everyone to own firearms, since every criminal has a firearm or machete in Brazil.
May as well. They already have the factories.
Wow, a real life experiment!  We'll get to see first hand if what the gun advocates say is true or not, like, pretty conclusively!
We can finally use this as an experiment to resolve whether or not guns help law abiding g citizens or contribute to the murder rate. 
Grats Brazil.

Sorry that it's mostly the US fault that criminals have access to cheap guns in the first place, but this is the best you can do to deal with that.
U.S Gun are not just made to defend again criminal, but the constitution make it to defend again the government too. It will be a matter of time before citizen start to lose they right or be forgotten. 
Well, this will be an interesting experiment.
I think this will just escalate things how about cracking down on corrupt law enforcement officers first?
Picking up my M1A in a couple days here in CA.  I hope you're able to do the same soon so you're not defenseless.
Don't worry just tell the people of Brazil to call the cops.
LOL, good luck!


I'm a pro right to bear arms American who is also a Democrat in favor of restrictions. Basically, I wish I lived in a place where I didn't have to worry about armed criminals but I'm not gonna stick my head in the sand. I used to find Reddit an intimidating place to talk about gun issues because the absolutists here wouldn't let any sincere debate happen. I'm happy to see that's changing a little bit. There's no election going on on Reddit, so the vote buttons shouldn't be used to try to make the other side disappear. Thoughtful debate is a great way to hone one's opinions and arguments. So having said all that, i've visited Brazil a couple times and my opinion of their ability to implement its own right to bear arms is generally favorable, but ought to be approached very cautiously. Can anyone point to an example of a big country who improved their crime stats by liberalizing gun ownership? If so, how did they implement?
I think US gun culture is more like your kid accidentally shooting your other kid with the gun you never actually needed for self-defense but still left lying loaded on the coffee table.
it seems the gun mafia wants to make some money
Let's do this Brazil!
r/watchpeopledie will get more material...
Marques said Brazil should not try to emulate the United States. “Our constitution emphasizes collective security not individual security,”

That is a sad and very sick statement. Its basically saying that your life doesn't matter as long as the status quo can be maintained.
I hope brazilians know that's a one way decision. Once everyone will have weapons in the country there is no turning back.
Welp looks like Live Leaks is going to end up with an overabundance of videos from Brazil
Well, like any nepotistic government who has given up on their people this is no
different, at the end the voter pays the price - be it money, time or life.
Well, if it's anything as bad as in the US, the death toll will rise but so will the
GDP due to weapons sales /s hooray

[This video sums it up] (https://youtu.be/P-s1G3MyM-8?t=16s)

Guy goes to rob a drugstore, gets his car stolen and his money stolen, when he goes to the police to press charges, he finds the drugstore owner there that recognizes him.

In case you're wondering how bad things are here on a lower basis (ignoring the fact rapists and murderers can go untouched as long they're underage), take a look at the video.

If you really like it, tweet this to John Oliver, I would laugh a lot. 8D
As a Brazilian, i think it's good for the people to be able to defend themselves against **criminals**. But as far as i know the people around here, i bet most of the time they will be used in fights, revenge, etc, them they gonna say they were defending themselves. Our culture is not habituated with the use of guns, most people can't even act civilized in public places, in metro/train stations for example, most people don't have respect for the elders or pregnant woman, they only think about themselves and go over whoever is in their way like animals, a behavior that generate a lot of fights. In 8 out of 10 times i get a train or metro, there's someone fighting, people lose their heads to easily. Some years ago, a guy stuck in the traffic near where i live got out of the car and shot a woman in the head. She was in the car behind him, he killed her because he thought she was the one that was honking, the guy was a off-duty cop, he was arrested but i doubt he spent much time in jail due the laws here.

I think it would be a good change if it was well monitored, allowing guns to the right people, make psychological tests, etc. But i know my country, i know it's impossible, the level of corruption is to high,  wrong people would still have guns, but now legally.
Criminal: I have a gun and they don't. Stealing is so easy!
  
Criminal: Oh? They have guns too? Crap, I might get shot!
 
When the criminals already have them, it makes sense for citizens to have them. When criminals don't have guns, the citizens don't need them! Will there be murders by ordinary people just because they have access to a gun in place of a knife? Yes. Is the increased risk for criminals worth the cost? We will see.
I hope this passes. Being formerly Guyanese I can personally tell you that gun control coupled with a high violent crime rate and incompetent/corrupt police fucking sucks if you're an ordinary citizen.
Having lived in a favela in Recife for a time, I can safely say that the gun culture of Brasil is alive and well. There is no part of the US culture that needs to be imported. They are able to create enough gun violence themselves. Most honest people are able to keep there heads down and stay away from the safados that think they run the world (really small perspective on what they think the world is). Getting more guns into those areas would only make them more dangerous and the worst people more powerful. 
This is great news for anyone who has been on the wrong side of a gun.
Well I wasn't expecting the majority of people here to be okay with this.
Good for Brazil!  But only letting people buy 600
Rounds a year is way too low
I think this is actually a good idea.
About time they man up. Nobody should have to ask for the right to defend themselves. 
Copy our "no sewage in Olympic water venues" instead. 
Lol. That post didn't go like you thought it would did it? The vast majority of people support people's rights to defend themselves, not to just be helpless victims pinning the responsibility of defending them onto someone else.
Gun rights and the asses that Brazilian girls are packing? I'm moving.
I'm not pro-gun but in countries where you can't even step outside without fearing for your life....screw it just give them a gun. 
I'm normally against gun ownership, but that's because I live in a country where gun crimes are very, very rare. When most criminals don't have access to firearms, there is no reason to make them more accessible.

Brazil, on the other hand, has moderately high gun crime rate, therefore every Brazilian should be able to bear arms.

Just my two cents.
In other news, America seeks to copy Brazilian butt culture by demanding all women get butt implants.
Isn't this just totally missing the point? If criminals and corrupt police have guns, shouldn't you be trying to stop criminals from getting guns, and rooting out corruption? It seems to me that adding more guns is going to create more problems that it's going to solve. 
As an armed American, Brazilians have my support! They should have every right to defend themselves.
Even a dog has a right to defend himself.  No reason an honest man shouldnt have the same.

I hope it passes just because I'd like to see how it plays out.  I understand both sides of the argument but it'll be interesting to see first hand if arming normal citizens decreases crime.
Honestly, if I lived in Brazil, I'd have a fuck load of guns.  
Brazilian here, and the chances of this happening are close to zero. One of the biggest names in congress here is famous for his radical thoughts, and while he has his followers, the biggest part of the nation thinks he's a lunatic. He's also one of - if not the biggest defender of the Gun Culture. Just to give an idea about him, he fully supports militar dictatorship, and claims the 21 years during the 60s-80s of militar dictatorship here in Brasil weren't even a real, just a period of military regime (you can search on the internet and see for yourself how the government acted on that time). That means that something he supports will attract a lot of opponents inside and outside the congress.
Ps.: I do not have a clear opinion on this. On one side, the law only prevents "normal" people from getting access to guns, since people who intend to use guns to do harm get access to them anyway. However, I do not think it is the right call to combat violence with more violence.. I guess we'll see what happens.
Ps2.: People in this thread seem to believe it is like a civil war is going on here. Brazil is like most other countries: some places are worse than others when it comes to violence. Some places are worse than others when it comes to drug dealing. However I'm 20 and I've never seen or been victim of robery or any other kind of violence, and I live relatively close to one of the country's big cities.

Hey, when you live in a country with an ineffectual police force and rampant organized crime and drug lords, maybe having the ordinary citizens armed wouldn't be such a bad idea.
As a brazilian, FUCKING FINALLY.

Social inequality is a problem. Lack of education investment is a problem. Poverty, marginalization, and blatant police corruption and abuse of the underprivileged and racial minorities is a problem, in drastic need of a long-term solution.

But those problems create a plethora of others, that hurt every sector of society. Criminals are also victims, but that doesn't make them innocent. Every sector of society is at war with itself, and the best way to create a stalemate is by escalating it until everyone goes 'fuck it. not worth it.', protects their own neighbourhoods, and THEN the long-term solutions can start being applied.

I've never been mugged in my entire life and always lived in neighbourhoods with armed guards at almost every corner. The fact is, it just works. Arming up would theoretically just make people die more in confrontation, but what it actually does is diverting crime elsewhere... Usually to where it came from.

Most small criminals know not to shit where they eat, but if they're pushed back to their communities and have to run their little routine mugging gigs there, the communities will fight back like they always have when someone decided to mess around in the hood: tied to a beam, beaten to a pulp.

And the cartels? We sent in the army before and we can do it again. It's obviously a social inequality problem and the cartels will keep growing, but constant police monitoring can make sure they never feel safe or confident; living in a nightmare won't be worth the money. They'll grow desperate, cornered. They'll kill, but for each one they kill a whole hill of them gets decimated.

Brazil is at war against itself. Ruining the enemy's recruitment logistics through proper education, social programs, and welfare IS useful, but it must also be fought on the battlefield, by as many honest citizens as possible. 

"Either keep the Fatherland free, or die for Brazil."
Based. Couldn't agree more, the Right to Bear Arms should be universal.
if handled correctly this might have a positive effect, i hope that is how it will go.
I completely support the right to bear arms no matter what. 

Power to the people. 
I'll promise to change my mind if this lead to a spike in violent crime if liberal Democrats and Europeans promise to change their mind if this leads to a drop in violent crime. Deal?
"Police are corrupt, violent, and unaccountable!"

"Why would you need to own a gun? Just call the police!"

American liberal logic.
Brazil is the country with the highest number of public lynching in the world. Population is tired of waiting for solutions, gun control didn't do shit, in fact, it got worse since criminals now know that honest people don't have guns, so they get away burning victims, killing for fun, raping and etc.

So the people start doing shit like this and much worse:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4vMxf8qOuU

If the state can't control criminals, can't effectively control guns and the police can't control the situation, then it's a better situation for the people to have their own ways of providing security.
Brazil is the murder capital of the world and somehow guns are illegal.

Give guns a chance.
It's astonishing how people think guns are the solution. 
Going so well over here, please emulate us. 
The amount of liberal tears this produces will be enough for a lifetime supply of gun lube. 'Merica
Well, it does help thin out the population.
Might actually help in Brazil. 
Does no one understand that the right to have a gun is as much about keeping a gone rogue government in check as it is self defense?
Do ppl just not know the historical significance of this? The no guns ppl need to look at the history of what happens when the citizenry of a country is denied the right to own a firearm. Does Nazi Germany ring a bell for anyone?
About damn time
Finally some good news.
I'm sure that it will work out for them just as well as it did for America!
American here.  If arming the populace worked to decrease crime, America would be a utopia.
Wait a minute, how are criminals who break the law, getting guns in Brazil?
 
Aren't guns illegal or heavily regulated?

I thought guns being illegal immediately makes all guns in the hands of criminals instantly vaporize. 
Devout 2nd amendment supporter here. It is a feeling of genuine joy to see other countries looking at the data and using common sense to give their citizens the born right to safety.

In draconian cities like New York and Los Angeles, you know what people do when criminals attack them? Call the police, hoping them and their guns how up quickly. Unfortunately, 7 minutes is a *fast* response time for the police in a major city. But being individually armed is an instantaneous equalizer against thugs.

Despite the hilarious hyperbole about how allowing people to carry guns openly or concealed will result in wild west shootouts, the data is so overwhelmingly contrary to that, that it still amazes me that people buy into the lies. States like Wyoming and Montana have virtually no crime compared to places like California and New Jersey. And that's not just absolute volume, but per capita as well.

I've got family from El Salvador as well as South Africa and Zaire. I've never met someone from the 'real world' that was a supporter of gun control. 
Wow....well, it's a start.

They need a proper affirmation of the human right to defend themselves, recognized in their Constitution as it's recognized in ours.

But it's a start.
Bold move Cotton, let's see how it works out for them!
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA HAHAHA, OH GOD THIS IS FUCKING GREAT!

I'm fully erect reading these butthurt comments. 

It's too fucking good. 

I can jast imaging 500000 fat, neckbearded, liberals squirming in their dorito stained chairs. 
The US states with the least restrictive gun laws have the lowest rates of gun homicides. 
good for them. 
You guys would love to think the rest of the world doesn't see your gun situation as an absolute disaster huh
if only more european countries did the same.

 
The right to own guns should be available to every person around the world. It has been obvious for quite some time that Brazil is especially in need of a change in policy.
Haha, not banning free men of the use of arms = "copying US gun culture"

what have these disarmament advocates been smoking?
Brazilian here. Born there, lived there until late 20s. That is one shitty culture where guns only come to make things worse. We used to have the right to carry guns once and changed that for the best. The amount of homicides dropped immensely.
Unfortunately in many latin countries people are just too emotional or too unstable to be easily allowed to carry guns. You see, if somebody cuts you while driving you get shot. If someone flirts with your girl you get shot. If someone reacts to an armed robbery with shots they will get shot (it is sad, but I'd rather be robbed than lose my life over property) . I am not kidding when I say that's how it was.
When we compare those countries, Brazil vs USA, there is more than just the law to think about, but also how society is organized. 
Now, in my personal believe I don't even think the gun empowerment works even for the US. A lot of crap happens there from teenagers being able to have an arsenal to do school shootings to arbitrary "self defense " murderers. But that is just MHO.
Brazuca Here:
The most annoying thing,... the most absurd thing is that every expert that shows up in a TV show say that in case of a robbery, rape and home invasion, be cool and cooperate with the criminal. NEVER REACT !

I wonder, how that would sounds to a US citizen , Israeli , Sweden ... etc...


Rooting out police corruption would be a much better idea.
People often compare the US to Europe. Why can't we be gun free? Because we share more in common with Brazil. We are more multicultural, we have a legacy of slavery and systemic racism. In other words they are as fucked up as we are. Of course the only way to keep it in check is borderline anarchy.
&gt;Critics fear the changes will lead to even more murders and an increase in vigilantism in a country where 50% of the population agree that “a good bandit is a dead bandit.

But if those bandits are also shooting people, then maybe it will wind up even. 

&gt;“Without doubt we will see an increase in the murder rate,” says Ivan Marques, executive director of the Sou de Paz institute, which campaigns for disarmament. 
&gt;“The number of deaths is directly related to the number of guns on the streets.”

Not everyone with arms acts the same, I would imagine. 

&gt;“We need to disarm the bandits not arm the people,”

Sounds like your last attempt didn't work very well, lol. 
Not a huge gun enthusiast as far as *what* Americans are allowed to own and how many seem to behave about their right to bear arms, but this is a much needed policy in such a state as Brazil.
But...but the liberal safe space professors told me guns were bad mmkay
If your society is so fucked up you need to arm your citizens then I can't see a good future for your country.
You're welcome.

-'Murica
go brazil!
Fuck yeah. I would personally buy a single mom in Brazil an AR-15 and some p-mags.
Meet Rodrigo Duterte, aka 'the real life Punisher'.  He is mayor of Davao City, which was once known as a crime ridden shithole.  After his take no prisoners approach towards crime, where he actively put bounties on the heads of criminals, Davao City is now known as one of the most peaceful places in all of SE Asia:

Great to see other countries embracing gun ownership.
Brazil has the right idea
An armed society is a polite and safe society -- just ask the Swiss.
Can somebody explain how creating an arms race with criminal organisations with far far greater firepower is going to help the situation? The only outcome I can see in this is maybe 200-300 gang members die; but thousands of innocent people will die to kill them.

It will descend into total war, and that's a situation where your average person cannot win.
They may get the RIGHT to defend themselves, the SKILL is a bit harder, and can't magically be given by law

It takes training and practice to develop skills necessary to win a gunfight..and a bit of luck
Barack and Killary can talk all the shit they want. The fact is 100 million Americans strongly support the 2nd Amendment and will never allow some traitorous politician to reverse it!
"We sure have a lot of gun violence here, you know what we really need? Additional people with guns!" Good god, America's bullshity gun philosophy for total retards is like an infectious disease at this point.
Add this to the list of articles that the gun grabbers don't want you to see.
Wha wha wha what? You are saying me citizens with guns actually lowers gun crime? But the liberal media says it's the exact opposite. 
600 rounds of ammo per year? In a summer month I could go thru that much ammo at the range just practicing 
Yeah way to go Brazil! As an armed American you guys have my support.
We don't have a "gun culture", we have a freedom culture.

Well, we used to...
Imagine, guns being used to protect yourself... 
Go Brazil!
Good. Everybody has the right to self defense, and everybody has the right to keep and bear arms. You don't have to have your rights written on a legal document to exercise them. They are your rights either way.

Well done, Brazil.
No one can hand you liberty and independence in a shiny box wrapped up in a pretty bow.

Liberty has to be taken with force, and kept with force.

Freedom is the willingness to do sudden battle anywhere at anytime and with utter recklessness. 

If you do not own a gun then you are simply living in the shadow of freedom that someone else is casting down to you. Free speech only exists when you possess the means to back it up. 

I would never desire to see people forcibly armed and forced to own a gun, but I will never allow the U.S. to be forcibly disarmed and to see a monopoly of force set forth by the government and their enforcement officers.

The people must have the same weapons that the local, state and three letter federal agencies possess. That is handguns, rifles and shotguns. There can never be a time when the police and federal agents possess these and the people do not. That can never be allowed to happen no matter what we have to do. 

Anytime that contract becomes broken then we must forcibly insist that it gets reinstated under a revolutionary war of insurrection against tyranny and consider and treat any enforcement agent of the state who would attempt to confiscate firearms on a federal level as a treasonous terrorist and engage them with extreme prejudice. 
I guess we'll finally find out if adding guns to a murder/violence problem fixes it or exacerbates it. Unfortunately it's my people in the lab.

I really hope it doesn't result in even more deaths.
[This is what I'm afraid of](http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2015/11/funcionario-reage-assalto-e-atira-contra-ladrao-dentro-de-pizzaria-em-sp.html) (just play the video and skip to 0:20).
Freeeeeeeedom!
Considering this legislation in the context of other modifications to Brazilian laws kind of makes me wonder just what some people there want to country to become.

* narrow the country’s robust definition of slave labor

* weaken indigenous tribes’ right to claim their ancestral lands

* exclude homosexual couples from the definition of family

* criminalize abortion in cases of rape.
Just in time for the 2016 Olympics, are they planning on arming the visitors/tourists as they get off the planes so they can defend themselves as well?
Everyone and their mums is packing heat.
This is all well and good but in the situation that a civilian shoots a corrupt cop what happens then?

Won't the corrupt people further up the ladder let it be known that you can't shoot an officer regardless of corruption?
Something something *City of God*
Neat.
All right, a natural experiment.
This shows exactly whats wrong with involuntary collectivism.

Voluntary association and participation for all human life in every aspect.
There is a large misconception in Brazil about gun laws.

This misconception is based on the fact that we are a very "bad mannering" people (or at least that's the folklore) in such a way that if you mess with the wrong girl (and by wrong girl I mean any girl that has a boyfriend or so) or swear on the traffic, you're basically increasing your chances of getting punched or killed.

Thing is, some people that are against gun possession believe that freedom of possession and carry will lead to a situation where, if you mess the wrong girl, you're dead, if it seemed like you messed (although you didn't), you're dead, if you swear while on traffic, you're dead, if you do an agressive maneuver, you're dead. If you point the middle finger during a football match, you're dead.

Thing is, and what people don't know, is that this kinda already happens because assholes DON'T ABIDE TO THE LAWS. Which means that, with our without legislation over it, they'll buy it and without legislation you're just kinda making it harder for you to follow the weapon to the culprit.
Reminds me of [Titus' version of gun control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85FhIHCQp_A) 
People here can barely discuss their ~~opinions~~ Football without going at each others throats, this isn't smart at all.
Cue Cuceascu. 
Those look like air guns
Makes sense. I wouldn't want that culture where I live (a country where police are respected and crime is mostly non-violent / theft related). But if I lived in a place where gangs and illegal weapons were common, and the police were hit and miss, I would want protection. 

In essence it is better if you can trust in the state to look after and secure your rights. But if the state fails, you should have the right to protect yourself. 
The only reason I don't support this is that I know for a fact there will be an increase in gun violence in the short term, and I don't know about the long term. The only reason I care about that is that I know for a fact that the left will use it to further their position on guns.
Fuel to the fire.  Brasil needs to control the criminality and ingrained political corruption before handing out weaponry to the populous.  This just harks toward a martial law state scenario. Or a revolution. 
Not going to make a difference. Brazil is going to need a J. Edgar Hoover type guy in the government who's ready to go to war with organized crime. Till then it's just going to be more of the same and probably more. It takes a culture. 
If their government is that bad at law enforcement, then more power to them. Let them arm themselves to protect themselves.
Kid runs down people in his car then jumps out and stabs people with a knife.  Runs down the street and fires a few errant shots into a house and then one into his head.  

Next day: WE MUST BAN GUNS!!!  

What?
Considering how often I see innocent people brutally murdered in Brazil in r/watchpeopledie... I can actually support this, whereas I don't support it as civility reaches a certain threshold. Brazil dies not meet that requoremebt
As Mr. Torgue said it best.
 "I SAID FUCK IT, LET'S GIVE EVERYONE GUNS!"
Just don't copy the part where antipsychotics are the most widely prescribed medications and it might turn out a little better.
holy fuck, that's one editorialized title

way to go Time
Brazil really is a country that's extremely similar to the US.  If people want to know what univeral healthcare would look like in America, they're probably the most accurate example.

I've hung around Liveleak enough to know that the citizens of Brazil need this. There's not always an off duty cop around to save you.
Good, take a look at r/watchpeopledie and it is overwhelmingly Brazilian 
The pink shotgun though...
That's funny.

You're talking about Brazil, right?  

HAHAHA... yeah.
Liveleak will ignite fireworks if this go through.
This in addition to an [$11.25 billion sale of warships](http://www.commondreams.org/news/2015/10/21/midst-war-us-approves-11-billion-combat-ships-saudi-arabia)
Gotta sell weapons to the friends of our enemies - how else would we keep this industrial war complex going.  
I wonder how much is going to get funneled to ISIS by the Saudis?
This is why people should stop taking America's "war on terror" seriously.
Meanwhile, students in US protest Halloween costumes. 
I'm grateful for Saudi Arabia stepping up and taking their share of the Syrian refugees. Oh wait! They haven't. Scumbugs. Kuwait too.
Saudi Arabia, the home of Salafism and Wahhabism, which gave us Al Qaeda and ISIS.


That US foreign policy for you and me...
Cha-ching: The American military industrial complex.
Everyone start writing your senators and representatives. The only way this will be stopped is if we start talking about it. 

Writes an email, write a letter, someone post that copy pasta for dissenting view of [insert here] legislation. 

Congress can vote to block the deal and if you feel negatively about this then you need to write your congress men and women about it immediately.  
Bearing my ignorance but how reliable of a source is truthdig?
Disgusting.
those sales have to be approved by the government?.

Who approved? May I have some names?
idiots
Just remember, the majority of 9-11 bombers were our "Friends" from Saudi Arabia.
What. The. Fuck.
I'm from the U.S. and I don't approve
People who claim that the US government represents them are delusional.
I'm sure this won't end us biting us in the ass in the future
This makes no sense. 
Thanks Obama! 
Many of those weapons will mysteriously land in the hands of ISIS
ELI5: how has no one stood up against this? We all know this shouldn't be happening, right? 
I believe one of the reasons we are always selling weapons to Saudi Arabia is because SA sells oil with US currency "the petrol dollar".  So if SA were to suddenly switch to a different currency the US dollar would take a big hit. So SA kinda has the US by the balls and the US can't do much. 
What in the everliving fuck, guys.
Just own the mercenary persona, already. I don't want to hear another word about letting weapons get into the hands of the wrong kind of people.
what the fuck...
So apparently obamas only anti guns in our country. So much for them not solving anything 
I wonder why Saudi Arabia needs that many weapons ?? :)
ISIS has to get their weapons from somewhere and if they didn't have any how would we justify spending all that money on military
What in the unholy fucking christ. You know what, I'm tired of this shit. Get your country in control you fuckwads. And don't give me shit about your country not respecting the will of its citizens. If you really believe your country is no longer a democracy then fucking do something about it. Christ.

Other countries will shut down in protest because of tuition hikes, but it seems like america will take anything in the ass as long as they can eat a Big Mac while watching Honey Boo Boo. Your democracy wasn't killed. You let it atrophy.
How is this not treason?
The title should be "terrorists on american soil who have complete control are selling weapons to terrorists on foreign soil." 
I wonder if this sale is for weapons that have already been produced and purchased by the US. If so, I also wonder if these are being sold for a profit, or if the buyers are getting a deal on stuff taxpayers paid full price for.
Isn't Wahhabi Islam, the state religion of Saudi Arabia?  Aren't they no different, ideologically, from ISIS?  Or am I wrong?

[How I feel right now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU)
Put a GPS/rfid marker in them because those are gonna show up in some places you didn't expect to... 

We are only at war because we let the weapon-dealers run their business unchallenged.
So we just sold $1.29 billion arms sales to ISIS?
Whatt a fucking disgusting joke. 

Half those arms being sold are going to end up in the hands of ISIS, if not more.

God I fucking hate our country. 
It's scary to think our men and women in the military are facing an enemy that we supply with weapons and money. It's a perversion of government and sensibility.
For democracy....
In the future we'll read how these weapons are used to kill SA citizens protesting to get democracy.
Sorry everyone else in the world.  I know we're retarded...
I actually can't believe how fucking stupid America are... we need to go to war with SA once the fuel runs out and we're making it harder for ourselves. 

Also, given that half of this is going to ISIS... You can blame your dead kids on Obama.
SOLD! To the Saudis that support ISIS! 
Can anyone properly explain this with out rhetoric?
If this is legit and approved by congress then the U.S. is will be responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths over the coming decade. This is too unbelievable.
Posted two days ago and still had shitty comments.

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3t4rhp/us_approves_129_bn_sale_of_bombs_to_saudi_arabia/
Saudi is basically ISIS with UN recognition. Someone compared some various punishments for crimes (and 'crimes'), and they were all either equal or ISIS was even slightly more lenient.

Plus, the Wahhabi iconoclasm. ISIS claims to want to destroy Mecca. SA destroys anything not directly part of a ritual, but keeps that stuff around for the steady income stream.
So selling warship to russia is not okay, but to the saudis nobody gives a shit?
THIS IS EXACTLY WHY I'M VOTING BERNIE SANDERS!!!
Does anyone honestly believe this will help 
They will pay the US back with its own money...
Can we get actual names of people who approved it? Because they need to be ousted
[Our partners in peace.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k30MOebDSww)
.......do you see what is wrong with this? Do you see? 
Idiots.
Did they supply ISIS with a Christmas catalog?
"Look Obie, can I call you Obie?  Look.  We'll bankroll a few people over here, discreetly, to raise a little hell and destabilize a few governments.

I know you're worried about oil prices but we've got enough to last us a lot longer than you know.  We'll just pump the fuck out of this thing harder than a teen boy after finding his first dose of porn on the internet.  I love me some teen boys, soft hands, delicate lips...Now, where was I?"

**"Teen boys?"**

"Oh, no Obie, haha you're a funny guy!  Oil.  We'll drive the price down so it is cheap on the worldwide market so the actual profits aren't a great enough margin for anybody that tries to sell bootleg crude to make a killing on."

**"And what will we get in return?"**

"We'll buy your weapons wholesale and when these regimes collapse, it will just be us, Jordan, Turkey and Iran left to take control of what remains.  Oh by the way, thanks for the nukes."

**"I didn't say anything about nukes."**

"Oh, I know Obie, but that really was such a *pleasant surprise*, you shouldn't have."
So if Hillary or Bernie gets elected, will they finally de-classify that report that points the finger at Saudi Arabia for housing/providing financial support to the 9/11 hijackers? In the meantime, surely this sale will lead to world peace. 
It's important the US supplies Saudi with cutting-edge weapons to help take on these monsters Isis, who decapitate people as punishment in the 21st century! Oh wait...
Why is it bad to sell arms to Saudi Arabia despite human rights, but good to sell arms to Assad despite human rights?
When I first read the headlines, I was screaming in my head "WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!"   
Isn't Saudi Arabia our "enemy" so to speak?  
Isn't Saudi Arabia the opposite of what the United States of America stands for?   
I mean, for crying out loud, didn't they  kill a teenager that was voicing their political views?  
Why, why, why, why, why?! Who is charge of all this shit?  
 
Can someone tell me what 1.29 billion dollars worth of guns looks like...?
Good. Lets load up the bombers, fly over there and drop everything on the sons-of-bitches. 
Gotta keep providing weapons to the enemies of the world, amirite...
Surely this is the deal that will finally push them into deploying major ground forces against the wannabee caliphate.  /s
So they can fucking sell them to terrorists? Goddamn America. 
Want $10/gallon gas? No? Then this is the price you, me, and everyone else will continue to pay until we switch to renewables. 
USA:We are against terrorism that does not make us more money.
What the fuck
Nothing could ever go wrong here...
[Fuck](http://replygif.net/t/fuck-you) the U.S. for doing this. Seriously.
USA needs to stop supporting terrorism

America! Just remember that we're a peace-loving, benevolent society. What a fucking joke.
pathetic
Why are we giving them weapons when they aren't actually willing to use them to fight ISIS? And why are we giving them anything in general when we have a deficit in the hundred billions, we are facing possible social security cuts, we never have enough money in the budget for improving our transportation networks, and college tuition costs are skyrocketing?
immoral and wrong.
Wtf????!!!! The saudis fund isis... time that shit happens to you so you STOP fucking the world i guess???
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
It is so nice to be so much better than everybody else! We really are exceptional!

War, 
War never changes...
You are a disgrace to this planet. 
Anyone still wanna pretend we are doing this for some reason other than the military industrial complex and creating excuses to justify larger government? No? Didn't think so.
This will probably be the stupidest shit I read today.

Wikileaks shows that Saudi Arabia directly funds ISIS and here we are supporting Saudi Arabia. This is why we need countries like Russia to fight ISIS because America's policy is really to feed the war machine. 

Interesting read on this topic: http://www.salon.com/2015/11/17/we_created_islamic_extremism_those_blaming_islam_for_isis_would_have_supported_osama_bin_laden_in_the_80s/
Fucking pathetic
saudi arabia is just an isis that reached legitimacy. it's probably going to funnel them to other isis-like elements in the region.
While Russia bombs the shit out of terrorists, we sell weapons to the biggest funder of terrorists. 
Aannd 3....2....1.... ISIS has it, fuckkkkkkkk
&gt;This notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded.
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
It's no longer a Democracy and never was. In a Democracy, the citizens would be able to stop things like this. It's an evil empire now.

Definition of evil is making money on people's death and suffering
We are being witness of the "legal" way the US supplies isis with weapons
and congress will act all confused how weapons keep making it to middle east. FUCK YOU ASSHOLES!!
This is fucking disgusting.
Who says the US doesn't export anything?
Good news look like ISIS is getting new weapons.

But seriously don't send Arabs weapons, it never works out well
Hahaha what the absolute fuck

How are people not making a bigger deal out of this? Especially with what just happened in paris
Dat military industrial complex though.
Jesus christ, US just fucked Europe in the ass even harder.
This fucking country. WHY?
Should have kept those weapons and USED them on Saudia Arabia...the #1 hypocrites In the Islamic World, who fund Daesh. It only happens because Boeing can push it through and all thier buddies in congress wouldn't dare stand against it, since many of them stand to make a lot of money being invested in the companies that drive the war machine. 
Dear American Government,

Please stop using my tax dollars to purchase weapons then sell such weapons to terrorists. Unless you plan on cutting me some of the profit please stop this shit. 
&gt;Top comment: "Gotta sell weapons to the friends of our enemies - how else would we keep this industrial war complex going".

Yeah Reddit hate for this anti-USA rant but FUCK YOU USA. Really fuck you! You have created such a shit storm in the Middle East. You have the power and influence to set a good example yet rub shoulders with countries like Saudi Arabia, trading oil and weapons for profit. The Petro-Dollar has caused nothing but war. Saudi Arabia may have its human right violations, but the USA is no different; High and mighty about democracy and freedom yet the amount of anguish and death brought on by the CIA in its "foreign affairs policies" is disgusting. 
This money could instead be spent on housing 600,000+ refugees instead of creating more refugees.
US policy is : we love the religious fundamentalists as long as they are economically liberal.


I'm the United States, did I approve this?
What can the average college student do to stop this from happening?
"US approves to indirectly fund ISIS" - better title
ITT: geopolitical, sociopolitical, historical experts 
nothing say's we support terrorism more then selling 1.29b of arms to the saudies. 
*Sees up-voted comments about the US giving weapons straight to ISIS*

Well, I'm out of here!
It is the only way US knows how to make billions.  Welcome to humanity.
"Our Allies who fund ISIS"
The united States funds global terrorism
I wonder how much this sale of arms is actually flowing into Syrian opposition groups?
I still want to know what happened to the 400 million worth of supplies that disappeared in Yemen.
Nooooooooooooo!!!!!!
Coming to a roadside near you!
yeah give the angry muslims more weapons. Good thinking US.
Da fuck?
Oh, ok.

No no, it's alright, lemme just

Expensive paperweights. Must be better ways for them to waste their money.
Arrrrgh! Could they just fucking NOT. Jesus fucking CHRIST.
Someone's misinterpreting the Boss' will again. 
God. Fucking. Dammit.
Awesome, we arm them so in 10 years we can fight them. 
Something something money.....
[deleted]
I believe its a conspiracy, so we can make more refugees that we will then be obligated to import

the only thing the middle-east gives america (and the world) is terrorism and refugees, and we're stirring the ingredients
when will over politicians stop bending over backwards for these fucking morons?


Can we please find an alternative to our dependence on oil.   


Then we can stop pretending to give a fuck about the middle east and let them kill each other without bothering the civilized world.
Gotta keep the military industrial complex chugging along.  Where was all that "change" we were promised?
CAN SOMEONE ELI5???
the military industrial complex is only interested in making money. they do not consider anything else. they will sell anything to anybody for cash with no questions asked. morality is a weakness and diplomacy reduces profits, so their long term goals are simply eliminate both.
Aka.  Us provides more weapons for ISIS. stay tuned for continued atrocities
Our government hates us. 
fuck the saudis.... fuck them so fucking hard...... i cannot believe we even have any ties with those fucking shitbags. I fucking hope arab spring comes to SA and those fucks who have been financing the fucking misery of decades get theirs.
And yet no one gives a shit, this won't be on the MSM, and it's going to be a way against Saudi Arabia in a few years when the world cuts out dealing with their bullshit.

This is beyond fucked up.
Jfc
At some point you just have to learn to deal with it. There will be many negative consequences for various people because of this, but there isn't one thing that regular people can do about it. It's unnecessary stress to dwell on it. Let the cards fall where they may and try to vote in people who won't agree to these things (if possible). 
Who approved this? Were US citizens asked?
How is it possible for one country to be so retarded in dealing with weapons? I don't even know why I'm surprised..
Why is this dropping in the ranks so fast?
That's a lot of arms.
I found [this little fact sheet](http://fas.org/asmp/profiles/saudi_arabia.htm) from 1990 to 2000... where we sold them $40B in arms over that time. So this is nothing new... it's just making me sadder.
I like how the world just tells ourselves we need to stop terrorism and stop funding terrorist states. Saudi Arabia proceeds to say they are combating terrorism and we are like, 'hell yeah' let's give these guys some guns and stuff, they could use it. What we fail to see is that the Saudi government structure is literally all Sunnis and pretty radical ones at that, what other groups are radical Sunnis? ISIL... Funny how you never hear of any terrorist attacks in the Islamic holy land where Mecca and Medina are. We are too blatantly ignorant to the fact that Saudi Arabia is most likely directly funding terrorists to allow a greater hold on the oil industries in the ISIL war torn regions... 
Who are they selling this weapons too? 
Our buisess is war and buddy, buisness is a boomin! 
I'm just glad they found these tactical munitions a nice home.

the world can be a scary place for an ownerless ordinance, let me tell you!
fuck..
The vast majority of 9/11 hijackers were Saudi and there are murmurs to this day that Saudi Arabia, at best turns a blind eye to terrorism.... anyway, nothing to see here
But we have no funds for our vets and homeless
... Why?... 
Nice! I love giving weapons to the guys who did 9/11!!! :D
HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY GO WRONG?
At least they are doing this shit in front of us circa Iran-Contra
Fantastic.

*"We fight Salafism by supporting Wahhabism"*

Makes perfect sense.
People bitch about everything. This is chess not checkers people. 
They are giving away our money. 
This makes no sense. 
Not a credible news source
Why would they do this? Their human rights records are not the best.
Crazy how a reputable source can be upvoted to the #2 spot.. Does anyone even open the link anymore?
More indirect funds for ISIS?
isn't Saudi Arabia funding ISIS?!
We should not be giving weapons to a country which oppresses so many people.
When can we vote on who we supply our arms to? 
This is insanity. 
Realpolitik leads to some strange bedfellows.
I have a feeling that we will be picking these weapons up off their bodies in a few decades...
Fucking disgusting. There seems to be a deep disconnect between the American people and the American government. This country is in dire need of a political structure makeover.
O good! Now if we can just give Israel the extra billions it's asking for we can form a grand axis of evil, errr, I mean a coalition of freedom &amp; democracy bent on destroying ISIS. Yea that sounds better. 
Can we as a country stop doing this please? 
Can someone eli5 the process for approving an arms deal like this? Who is involved? How does it work? Is it just the president? Does congress do anything? Does the Pentagon have a role?
I really do not think we should be selling arms or giving them away to ANYONE at this point. 
This is disgusting and needs to stop.
Aka one jet fighter
I wonder what kind of background check and licencing they had to go through... 
OK, for those who are not aware, in this scale, $1.29B isn't really that much money, but is is a SHIT TON of weapons.
wOHOOOOOO ITS NOT LIKE MORE ARABS WILL BE GIVEN WEAPONS BY SAUDI ARABIA LIKE EVERY SINGLE TIME
Those weapons will last the next 100 years if stored properly. Who knows how many will return to their homeland eventually. At 3000 Feet per second.
Fuck everything about this goddamned administration!
I hope all the shit we sell them can be tracked or rigged to self destruct
Is this something congress voted on and if so does anyone know the name of the bill?
For fuck sakes America, stop misbehaving. 
My biggest fear is that some Saudi officers would make quick bucks by selling their old weapons to Daesh (ISIS).
The Jews in the defense industry rejoice. Then scratch their heads. Then rejoice.
Because they are our friends and they also hate Iranians.
I don't even know, Storskog is so far away north, there is almost no infrastructure, only few very small towns, the roads are very bad etc. I doubt that there are any passenger trains in 50-100 km radius. As a Russian I don't know anybody who has been to those places. I don't even know how to get there. Crossing border there is one of the worst decisions you can make. Why not crossing forest border with Latvia or Estonia? 

That place is like Alaska for US but much worse, it is very far from civilization.
"So far, none of them have been sent back to Afghanistan."

In that case, I dont find it a clear message at all..


I read some of the interviews with the migrants that this article relates to and the fact that they are trying to game the system is quite clear. First of all, many of them claim that they are Syrian, when they are from Afghanistan, in an effort to validate their refugee claim. Secondly, many of these people have lived in Russia for years, some for as long as 15 years! They say, during these anonymous interviews, that they are migrating from Russia because of the poor living conditions and the lack of available jobs (for them, jobs might not be a large problem for natives).
There's no war going on in Russia. If you flee from there, you're not a refugee. 
The moment they hit the first country that is safe, they are no longer refugees, but immigrants seeking something better.
**Edit done at 21:09 GMT**

We should ask ourselves a question of "Yes, we can and should help those refugees, but how many can we help, and for how long can we help and sustain them". People are saying it is inhumane and immoral that we do not take all the refugees, give them housing, jobs, healthcare and education; I believe we should help them - yes. 

*However in what context?*

Should we just give them food, water, basic shelter and education, and then wait whilst the EU decides what to do with them? Yes, that's what I amongst others think. They are refugees - they have nothing. By giving them those basic human rights, and offering them to stay in peaceful democratic West we have already increased their standard of living by 10x. Why should we be obliged to give them; jobs? Housing? Social security and welfare? Also, who is going to pay for that - money for those things doesn't grow in a magical land, me and you pay for that through taxes. 

Before helping these refugees, I'd like to first help people that were born in the Europe and European Union that are struggling to make ends meet - drug abusers, homeless people, unemployed people, families living on minimum wage, kids that don't have lunches when they go to school because parents can't afford a fucking loaf of bread and a slice of ham. 

One million refugees - or city of Brussels, waiting to be fed and looking for better lives. That's only this year. 
Next year it could be two million. Or three. Or maybe even whole Syria. How long can we sustain them? A year? Perhaps two before the public will say that's enough - help your own people first, before helping some refugees from Middle-East.  

So yes, perhaps it does seem inhumane and immoral to not take refugees. However, ask yourself basic questions of what we're going to do with these refugees, who's going to pay for them, what will be the cultural and social implications of such mass integration, how will the public react; perhaps you think that taking refugees is great, but for every person that agrees with you there can be 10 that disagree. 

**End of EDIT** ^^^^




I believe that most of us deep down are fine with refugees. Europe (not European Union) is an area of over 50+ countries with a population of 740 million. Increasing the population even by a million due to refugee crisis is a drop in the ocean.

**However**
,the problem that I have (along with others) is that these so called "refugees" lose their status as a refugee, when instead of staying in one country that offers them shelter, jobs, social security etc. want to go and travel to the West, or to countries with high GDP per capita such as France, UK and Germany, where they believe will find equivalent of American Dream, but in Europe. 

Those people are not refugees - they are now economic migrants; a person or people that travel from one country or area to another in order to improve their standard of living. 

*It is wrong.* **Period.**

This is what irritates me and the others - sure I understand, you're running away from war and god knows what else, to have a better life for you and your family. But do not, and I repeat - do not think that you are entitled to something (benefits etc.) without contributing to the economy first. You are not. And you won't be. 

Take Poland for example - when a refugee does come to Poland, those who stay in the aforementioned camps receive an allowance of around 210 złoty (roughly £50) a month, in addition to but not limited to free Polish lessons, health care, and dental care. Children also have the right to go to school in the camps. Refugees who chose to live outside the camps can get up to 750 (roughly £120) złoty, but this number varies depending on whether or not they are independent or with their family. This whole scheme costs the Office for Foreigners 56 million złoty (£10 million) per year. http://www.krakowpost.com/10477/2015/09/poland-to-accept-5000-refugees

Yet, at the moment Poland has 11 refugee camps in which there are 1,549 people with **431 vacancies left.**

This is what is wrong - they are providing those refugees with basic human rights; medical-dental care, education, food, shelter and Polish lessons, yet those refugees ignore that and choose to travel to France to get on a boat to UK.

That is my opinion on the crisis, I'd like to hear your opinion on it.


They crossed a bunch of other peaceful countries too. This is no longer about escaping the war, its about getting that sweet sweet government cheese.
[deleted]
I just feel like a whole bunch of them are just here because they think Europe is paradise. They come to my country and recieve money just for being here as a refugee. They get more than some people who are unemployed after 30years of hard work. That's just total BS to me. 

edit: Don't get me wrong, many of them are fleeing from war. But loads of them just keep on traveling to countries they heard give shelter AND lots of money. 
Sick of the people coming to sweden. I was okay with it at first, thought we were helping then i met the spoiled cunts that have migrated up here. I hope we kick half of them out
Its OK, come to Sweden, we are fucked anyway. 
Smart People.
Don't go to the nordic countries. We have pretty shitty welfare really and there's not much jobs here anyway. There is barely a future for many of us who already live here.
Good. It's about time someone ropes in this foolishness.
Finally people start to realize that we can't let them do whatever they want.
It's interesting to see the moderate humans who pay no attention to politics express worry and concern about the impending wave of immigration and be objurgated by an affluent liberal for being racist. 

Is it any wonder natives are less tolerate of refugees and migrants when someone asks "How much will this cost" Or "We're having problems with the NHS and housing, how will this affect those problems?" to be branded a 'fucking moron' or 'right wing scum!'


Or send them straight to Germany like any other country is doing now.
a massive influx of foreigners into a sovereign state is cause for concern. They stopped being refugees when they crossed the first safe-safe border and became immigrants instead. 
Gave this thread a quick skim, lots of chatter about Sweden, what's the deal?

Is Sweden where all the immigrants want to go? 
As much as Russia is a shithole, it's a stable enough shithole. At least you're not threatened by war there. As harsh as it may sound, refugees in Russia can stay in Russia. It's far from perfect, but they'll be safe enough, and that should be the important thing when you're a refugee. I'm with Norway on this one.
Can someone ELI5?  How the fuck are afghans getting to norway via russia *en masse by bicycle?*  Sounds like an onion headline to me!  I mean I know it's a contiguous land mass, but that's traveling the entire north-south of Europe by bike and up through the frozen north!
It's not that people don't want to help out by taking in refugees...

The problem is that when people come to other countries to live, they need to assimilate into that culture and obey those laws and want to become citizens of that country.

Muslims though want to force those countries and their people into changing their cultures and laws into islamic cultures/laws to accommodate them. 
Fair enough. Russia is a nice place to live.
This is really interesting from the NY Times obit on the founder of the International Rescue Committee

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/nyregion/robert-p-devecchi-who-led-international-rescue-committee-dies-at-85.html

"DeVecchi also oversaw the creation of the Women’s Commission for Refugee Women and Children, a group devoted to helping the disproportionately large number of refugee women."

Yet, some 70% of all 'refugees' flooding to Europe are men.

Europe is such a sucker...

This migrant situation is the modern Trojan horse.

We are witnessing a major moment in history, and it isn't positive.
As an Afghan, I feel bad about the situation in Europe. Afghans aren't bad people, and in time they will integrate just fine I think. But we are a bunch of unthankful and undeserving pricks. If someone like that came into my home, I would kick them right out and tell them to be thankful for every crumb they get because where theyre from there aint sh*t -- so dont bring that here. 

Send the immigrants to Israel, Jews are very progressive people.

They crossed a bunch of other peaceful countries too. This is no longer about escaping the war, its about getting that sweet sweet government cheese.
yes!!! let's put all of Arabia into Scandinavia.  

Problem fixed! Fantastic! The world will finally know peace!  
People often ask me why I don't give a shit about those poor refugees, then I wonder what would happen if we were in their situation. If war broke out in Europe, would they welcome us? I don't think so, for even the UAE and Saudi-Arabia have shut down their borders on their own people, while we, at the moment, welcome people from a totally different culture, people who we don't know. So they come to us, and they bring crime, they bring diseases and they just bring problems in general. They expect us to live by their rules and their culture, because they don't want to integrate, or even do anything productive for the country that is helping them. They have already banned serving pork of any kind many places where I live because it goes against muslim belief. In any case, they just come to us in the hopes of creating a new home away from home, where they try to build a similar society FROM WHICH THEY FLED. But they are still coming, and now we are stuck with them, and the resources they use up are taken elsewhere from the society we built. Our education, our healthcare, our social-security - all these sectors suffer financially due to the refugee crisis. We put our childrens' future at risk, only to welcome more trouble. We will suffer from this some time in the future, and all because of some liberal pricks who felt bad for the muslims because some 100 years or more ago our people oppressed their people, and we owe it to them to help them.
I live 3 minutes away... ibe been setting up lights for refugee camps for the last month. So many refugees here.
Norway can't stand seeing the "culture" these people bring with them. Leave your religion at home and we're fine. But they can't. They come into a nation then start demanding everyone follow the religion they brought with them. Norway is being smart and ending it before it starts. France didn't and look at it. Muslims will own France in 30 years tops. 
I went through there earlier this week and I can confirm, the amount of people crossing is crazy, got prioritized past like 50 people standing in line. It also gets dark at 2pm now, and the groups of migrants along the road are really hard to spot, this coupled with Russian driving there's bound to be a serious accident soon tbh.
norwegian here and i want to say this
: norway was once a country full of badass vikings, and now it's  place for immigrants who does not wanna follow our laws. we are accepting way to many foreigners and crime has risen because of it. still it's not as bad as sweden
[deleted]
wooo free ticket home
Good. This is good.
Glad someone is standing up to predatory migration.
I understand that this is an issue, but why do we have to make it about culture/racism? No shit they are going to act different from the European country they go to! They were raised in a totally different country and we should be helping them to prosper. It makes me sad because I am an Afghan girl and my parents came to America way back when, but if it wasn't for immigration, I might have been born and raised there too :( We are all just people. And Afghans have wonderful hearts and are usually very hospitable people. They are just people who have seen a lot of trauma in their lives. I agree I can't say anything about how they act over there in those European countries, but shouldn't we be helping them? Why can't we look at them as people and help them to BETTER THEMSELVES instead of saying "Eh just send em back". What good will that do to help their country? It also upsets me to see all this hate for them because they are such an oppressed people and it's not the citizens' fault entirely. Also I always see Iranian people who are doing so well (namekhuda!) in the western world, but they have opportunities that Afghans are barely now having. It's so sad. Please people just send love, we are just wanting the same goal.. To be safe and have our families. Sucks to see all the racism out there. 
Afghans are coming to Europe too now? Jesus, there really *is* a civil war involving Islam in Europe on the way. 
Now imagine the massive amount of migrants who have died in that polar region. The number of people moving through there is a drop in the bucket in comparison to The Balkan  and Mediterranean however.

Murmansk is an unforgivable region. It also has very little roads, railroads, and land marks. So its quite easy to get lost in that province. This is like getting lost in Siberia, honestly. 
Boot them hard, boot them fast, boot so they bounce.

Controversial thought,  require migrants to be educated,  pay a tax, give up Islam and barred from welfare.  Politicians supporting refugees required to host a family each. 
They should have nightclub rules. You can come in but only if you bring a hot chick with you.
What really pisses me off is that we're spending so much money these economic immigrants (most of them aren't even from Syria) here in Europe, while those who really need help are still back in Syria or in camps in the surrounding countries.
The money we spend on these few would have a much larger impact in the (actual) refugee camps
Its amazing that there are so many leechers coming. What is more distrubing is that there are people in europe that actually defends these people.

No hate for Norway.

America wanting illegal immigrants deported?

Racists!
But Bernie Sanders' supporters keep telling me Norway is the land of free things and racial tolerance.

Why are they not being given free education or let alone the right to cross the border. Norway is meant to be a utopia!
 

https://i.imgur.com/HsQ9W2S.jpg
So when Europeans do this it's within their right as a sovereign state, but when Americans suggest doing it they are called racists.
European countries have been far too reactive with this whole refugee/migrant crisis, and not at all proactive.  I see that as a huge problem as the system in place to deal with this is going to always be behind the times.
Meanwhile in Australia we just send most of them packing to the nearest poor pacific or south east asian country.

We are doing an in take soon of Syrian Christians, Yazidis, Kurds and Women an Children...like 15,000 sorry Europe looks like you get the other few million.

Nor**way** you guys are gettin in here
That must be such a weird thing to see. Afganis pretending to be refugees, coming from Russia into Norway, only 30 degrees south of the pole where snow cakes everything.
[That'd be bad for the booming bicycle business in Murmansk](http://cdn1.pri.org/sites/default/files/story/images/CROPsmugglerbike.jpg)
Want to bet that every migrant crossing that border are going to be suddenly from Syria?
How the hell is this different from the economic migration from Mexico to US? The answer: IT ISN'T. All of my European friends that like to criticize the US for not wanting uncontrolled flow of economic immigrants who drain the system and refuse to assimilate are now complaining that it's happening to them?! The hypocrisy here is disgusting. 
It's called an invasion folks.

Europe,   just have some backbone.    Defeat ISIS and the Taliban instead of accepting all these refugees.     Sooner or later this migration will lead to terrorism,  and you all know it.
But wait! That's racist!

I...I don't understand this situation with immigrants.  Foreign people in impoverished/war torn places have been dying for years.  What's the logic behind helping these specific people when we won't help anyone else?
I live in a town in Sweden that houses one of the largest refugee 'camps' in Europe. I'm a UK ex-pat immigrant myself but I can understand the frustration that the natives have with this exodus of Syrian immigrants arriving bus after bus after bus to this town of 20,000 people. There's no plan for integration or even housing outside of tents and some generators for heaters.

It's fucked up, but one day, most Swedes will be proud of how they treated these refugees and immigrants looking for a better life. I've met plenty of Syrians who braved atrocious conditions to get here and that's only the beginning.

I only hope that they will not become ostracised and segregated, there is already enough of that. There needs to be a clear and concerted attempt at integration. Start businesses, learn the language, study, get jobs etc.
I wish America gave one way tickets back for people crossing the border
Would this be a issue if the refugees/immigrants were Buddhists, Agnostics, Jews, Hindus?
Oh my gosh! They are so bad for sending people back to their country of origin when they enter illegally /s
Just send them to Sweden. They are all for immigrants.
Possibly unrelated question: why Europe? Why do we never hear anything about migrants moving to say, China? Do they even? If not, why not?
Good send the terrorists/rapist back tot heir shithole.
I love how reddit liberals jizz over all things Nordic.  How about this dose of reality?
This is where we are going if we elect Bernie.
Aw, so much for all your heartbleeding bullshit, Norway.
Newsflash: 

Migrants have turned large parts of the USA and Sweden into violent ethnic enclaves that take on all the worst features of the places they left.

Both the USA and Sweden started with high levels of human capital and, though a superabundance of magnanimity, allowed in far, far more migrants in than could be peaceably educated, acculturated, and integrated into the society as a whole.  

The net result in both cases is the same - huge violent ethnic enclaves that have done little besides transplant the attitudes and skillsets that breed poverty in (some shitty country) to America and Sweden.  The spillover effects on education, health care, and police forces are nasty.

Narratives form the left about the sources of poverty have been misleading at best.  Theivery, thuggery, corruption widespread violence don't come out of a vacuum, they in significant part come out of permissive cultural attitudes towards the conduct that drives investors away from dirt-cheap real wages present in the 3rd world.

Sweden has had enough, America has had enough, and Norway is doing what it can to prevent it from even getting started.
So essentially it's mostly people who want the good life and don't work, expressly refusing to work while these people, mostly Muslim, living in benefits telling about how horrible the west is
It looks like Norway is not the loving, welcoming, socialist place you all have desired.
some turkish immigrants are practically east-europeans, and can be okay

but afghans are literally the worst and most backwarded people on the planet - no way in hell do you want to open the door to them

you got to be realistic and super selective about immigration, if you even want to take that on in the first place
Personally, I think anyone and everyone fleeing a war-torn country who thinks that getting into one safe country gives them some sort of right to choose which other country they ultimately want to settle in should all be either deported back to their shithole of a nation that they helped create or just carpet-bombed.
My parents were afghan refugees and seeing this news pisses me off just as much as others. If you can't integrate with a country then don't go there. Simple. It shouldn't have to be that going to another country grants you a handout and you get to milk the system without contributing anything. Its absolutely absurd.
Shit would NEVER fly in the States... we're not even allowed to call people who sneak into our country, contrary to our laws, "Illegal Immigrants"... bad for their self-esteem as criminals, or some such.

Too bad there's not some sort of legitimate body, tasked with addressing such unpopular laws in the US. Oh, wait... there IS... they just don't do their jobs.
There was a post in r/dataisbeautiful showing the routes these invaders took from their countries into Europe.  There were dots flowing on a map into Europe and another redditor astutely observed that these people aren't stopping where there is no war.  The dots/invaders continue to flow into whatever countries offer the best benefits to the unemployed.
I wish Germany would do the same, but as long as "Mutti's" regime is in power, there will sooner be mass evictions of German citizens...

I mean it already happens with retirement and nursery homes, schools and state owned social apartments. When they run out of empty, private owned apartments and office buildings to seize, it won't take long till people get kicked out of houses and apartments the state considers too big for the amount of people living in there and gives them to illegal immigrants. The possibility of letting illegals move into already occupied apartments, even against the will of the tenants, is already being considered as well...
This is racist and bigoted. Everything is racist!
America should build a fence (electronic or otherwise) on its border, and Europe should do the same. 
No war in bloody Afghanistan. They're luxury seekers trying to piggyback on the "Syrian" "refugee" crisis.
They'll just enter at another border crossing 
If only the Swedish politicians and media had half the sense of the Norwegians. 
If Sweden and Norway are so good that we have to emulate them, then why isn't everyone angry that they are using deportation for illegal immigration?
I guess that destroys the economic migrant argument. Why would you look for a better life in Russia? That county has the most FUBAR economy.
Made me think of... http://imgur.com/gallery/ykLxDDj/new
Wow. A lot of hateful comments here.
Thanks G.W. bush for the gift that keeps on giving.
Meanwhile in sweden. They are threated as "guests" and are given housing and food. And the food they serve? 
Hamburgers, kebab, lamb stew, chicken stews etc every day of the week.  
I also don't understand why Syrian refugees leave Jordan. Jordan is the best country in the region, better than even Turkey and Israel. They are very stable, very safe, very picturesque too, and have a beauty queen. The Jordanian monarchy have sheltered Syrians and offering jobs, so I don't know why Syrians make the long difficult journey to Europe.

Finally some sanity. Charity and giving is good work, but it isn't wise to put your own nation/culture/values at such risk for people who presume on your naivite.
...
ITT: people that think the cost of refugees is only food, shelter, and education. The social cost is enormous; the amount of theft and rape for one. Look up the demographic  stats of rape in Oslo. Yet leftists will still blame the evil white patriarchy or something.
Why aren't all these illegal immigrants being resettled back in their own area of the world. There are plenty of rich middle eastern countries that should be made to look after this problem and not have Europe be infested by it.
I wonder if the US will ever step up? They've had a habit of amplifying a host of humanitarian crises in the Middle East in the past decade but haven't taken in their deserved share of resulting refugees.

Why should the likes of Sweden, Hungary, Slovenia etc. suffer the repercussions that they played absolutely no part in causing?
As the joke goes: A banker, a worker and a refugee are sitting at a table with twenty cookies. The banker takes 19 and turns to the worker and says 'Watch out, the refugee is going to take your cookie!'.

Just as Europeans bail out private bankers, oligarchs and corrupt corporations, time and time again, to the tune of hundreds of billions of Euros, they're also told that it is the refugee that will rob them. But like most of us the refugee just does what they can to protect their families and have a meaningful life, and mourn that they cannot do so in the place they call home.
Russia: the only European country that isn't a giant yeast-infectiony pussy right now.
What I've learned from These refugees is that Europe is far more intolerant than America
Finally a white nation who chooses not to commit cultural suicide.
I warned you people from the start. The migrants will play the system and take fucking advantage of your homes. They will move in and take over. They will dilute your culture and ruin your future.

My country is bereft of its own identity. You'd be hard pressed to even find white people in many of the municipalities and schools.

My hometown is done for. There is nothing left to go back to.
Wilderness..unpatrolled
Clear.  Mmhmm.
Keyword: "can".
this is just a drop in the ocean of migrant crisis problems
*had to look up where Kabul is...*
Sweet, free adventure!
Do not try to cross a Norwegian's "Big Wood."
If you cross the border at Storskog, you're gonna have a bad time.

Good, now to increase it to all single males coming from similar nations without pre-approved travel or immigration papers.
[Wow](http://www.reddit.com)
Damn, I wish this happened a week before it did for my Model UN debate on the Syrian Refugee Crisis. So many good points.
I thought this border was a secret between us Norwegians and our Russian neighbours!
Racist Norwegians! Where is Jorge Ramos?
First place I learned this and I'm Norwegian. 
Non-white immigration to Europe is going to annihilate the indigenous people. RIP Europe. All because of some self hating SJWs in gov
Wow

Europeans dare criticize our treatment of immigrants when you could soak up all the xenophobia in here with a mop.
I love how all the right winged people are saying that they are being labeled as Nazi's/racists by leftist so they can't voice their opinion. They are all upvoted though and anybody bringing up counterarguments or asking for statistics is being downvoted to hell.
Reddit is completely unsalvagable.
Ah, the Nordic model. A perfect socialist utopia. All you have to do is keep poor people out. And if they have a different race or religion, even better.

Edit: I'm getting a lot of downvotes for this one. I feel like this comment contributes to the discussion, but I must be wrong. The only other alternative is that people are using the downvote as a disagree button, and we all know that never happens on Reddit.
Why is Norway allowing them to come in from continental Europe, then?
Free flight tickets for everyone, jay!
Want to do heroin in a room? Come to the Nordic countries!

Want to escape oppressive Russia and look for a better life? Better find a different home.

The hypocrisy on reddit with regards to the Nordic countries astounds me. "Lets be Norway! Lets be Sweden! Their quality of life is amazing, they're so amazing!"
Why is this acceptable, but if an American politician were to say the same about migrants from Latin America there would be an uproar?
People are quick to turn on the least powerful out of hate and fear, meanwhile the very wealthy and powerful rob us blind everyday.
It cracks me up how incredibly hypocritical people are regarding immigrants. You Europeans give us Americans shit for how we treat illegal Immigrants and what happens when you guys are faced with the same situation? GTFO, the lot of you. I mean I already knew how hypocritical Europeans were but this situation here just proves it. Sweet irony.
Stupid policy. Norway is probably the last country on earth that should be turning away additional labor and consumers. Sweden and Denmark as well.
Based Norway, telling it like it is.
If you leave a country for economic reasons you forfeit the any phrase that sounds like "in my country, people retired at 50 but here i have to work until 65". Clearly that hasn't worked out for them. And THIS is now your country so start treating it as such or go the fuck back
If these people would have stayed and fought for their freedom this wouldn't have been such an issue. Fly them home, hand them an AK and a couple of clips full of ammo, and wish them luck.
If you have asylum in Russia, there is no reason to come to Norway beside the economic benefits, or if you happened to be gay.
Hahahaha, good luck with this. Odds that US liberals will criticize them for this? 
Can you imagine the fall out if Trump said something like that?

What democracy and Freedom?  Now we know how Europeans are.  They talk the talk, but no substance.
Am I allowed to flee America's War on Drugs &amp; be a refugee in, say, Portugal?
Good. 
Refugees, or seeking even more welfare?.
Bunch of poor refugees running away from a war only to face another obstacle.
oh hey look the daily mail readers are here
USA createtd all this mess in the middle east let them take all the migrants.
It's good that Norway is speaking out. Unlike the US president who won't say anything about the shitloads of illegals in the US. Nobama is completely oblivious as to how poorly he's viewed around the world as a weak president. It's f'ing pathetic and embarrassing. I hope the EU can fix this migration problem started by Nobama. It all started with his endorsement of the Muslim brotherhood in Egypt.
Don't mess with the Vikings. 
Didn't know there was a war inside Russia too. Or is it that Norway gives more benefits? If they come to England they will starve hahaha. Government shutting down benefits even to Europeans who haven't been here long enough. 
Kabul is wonderful this time of year
Does Norway have a program that provides birth control and other population control programs internationally?  With war, disease and jobs in decline there needs to be some serious efforts at depopulation worldwide.
I love Norwegian names for things, they are always so silly (I'm a Swede).

"Storskog" literally means "big forest".

/s
We could just tax people around the world correctly and stop bombing the fuck out of everything.

We'd have a lot less poor people and a lot less refugees.

But that would be far too difficult! 
Holy shit, the amount of intolerance in this thread is unbelievable.
God forbid someone want a better life for themselves and/or their children.
this thread is full of racists who don't even know they are... sad sad world, sad sad reddit today
How brave of Norway! Sending migrants fleeing an active war zone back to the war zone. /s

It's sad that these kind of "anti-refugee" stances are increasingly popular in Western Europe these days. Especially considering that the West has played a major role in the very wars these populations are fleeing.
Funny how the USA IS the core reason for these refugees problem but doesn't really affected by it. 
[deleted]
And yet a month ago, when anybody suggested that migrants should probably not be doing what they're doing, the shrill over emotional, illogical noise that was made in response insisting this sort of thinking is 'xenophobic' and racist and evil was almost overwhelming. It was an all out effort to try and force consensus in the worst possible way, and already because of that, the problem has only been made worse, as we can see now.
Man..., Reddit is a funny place.
Is there war going on in Afghanistan?....

Nice site, btw:

&gt; Flares light up the Arctic sky over Kola Peninsula as aquaculture farmers put fire to perverted salmon. 
As a Norwegian this more about keeping people out of our country. Many people don't know this but we hate outsiders and are a very racist people. Norwegians on the whole hate Arabs mostly do to the enormous difference in our cultures. We hate change and other people imposing other cultures on out land. So basically stay out everyone we don't want you. If you don't believe me Norway is one of the hardest country's in the world to immigrate to and live in. 
Seeing a lot of comments from people who definitely AREN'T nor ever have been a REFUGEE.

Russia and the United States are both directly responsible for the utter shit show that is Afghanistan in the modern era.  Also, the fucking UK sure didn't help matters with their persistent meddling in the affairs of foreign nations for centuries, Afghanistan being just another example of idiot Westerners pretending to give a fuck about the nations they exploit.

When armed nations suck up real world value with their policies - what is the rest of the world supposed to do?  The sad truth is that these governments have turned the Middle East into a free-for-all of death-worshiping, mind-fucked fanatics, and a vast majority of sane, reasonable people caught between the knives of zealots and the air force bombardment from foreign drones.

Think about it this way - if Russia and the United States didn't have massive armies and massive technological weapons - how long do you think the world would tolerate their insane, narcissistic monkeyfuckery?  Why should people who live halfway around the world give even the tiniest of fucks about what some people who live halfway around the world and don't understand their culture or speak their language, think about them?  Do Americans give a shit what Iranians think of them?  I don't see that reflected in our policies or our public debate.  Goes double for Afghanistan - Americans couldn't give less of a fuck if we nuked those sorry bastards, and some would be outright delighted to hear that Kabul was erased by a nuke - despite the fact that erasing that destroyed city wouldn't change a thing.

Read Charlie Wilson's War to see how our clandestine operations are conducted in the real world, and stop wondering why poor people want to come to stable rich countries where governmental abuses of this astronomically fucked nature aren't permitted locally, and aren't needed for a citizenry grown fat, drunk, and lazy on its own success.

All these nations are complicit.  Their markets don't operate with this tepid altruism, regardless of the fine words of smiling politicians.

Edit: Unpopular opinion?  Oh well, suck it up, kids.  It's the truth.

&gt; Louis had been attending the Eagles of Death Metal concert with his mother Elsa Delplace, 35, and his grandmother Patricia San Martin, 61, when it was attacked by terrorist gunmen.

&gt; Ms Delplace and Ms San Martin were both shot dead as they tried to protect him - leaving him covered in blood.

The headline should include the grandmother too :(
most moms say they would take a bullet for their kids, thankfully most don't have to. RIP brave ladies
This is heartbreaking, the kind of stuff I really don't wanna think about for too long, just think of that family, that day wrecked havoc on it.
&gt; In a Facebook post, French journalist Antoine Leiris, whose wife Helene Muyal-Leiris also died in the Bataclan attack, said "you will not have my hatred".

&gt; He said: "I don't know who you are and I don't want to know, you are dead souls. If this God for whom you kill blindly made us in his image, every bullet in the body of my wife is a wound in his heart.

&gt; "So no, I will not give you the satisfaction of hating you. You want it, but to respond to hatred with anger would be to give in to the same ignorance that made you what you are."

Wow. So powerful and spot on. RIP.
I would like to donate to a fund or something for this child 
oh god, my heart ...
omfg. fuck this. the fact that these people beleive they are doing their god's work is just so beyond what i can reconcile.
Respect, mama and grandma. You saved your baby. He'll miss you. :(
The mom and grandma are true hero's. Hope that kid can live a half decently normal life. I know he's probably gonna be really psychologically fucked up now.. 
That kid's growing up with a lightning bolt scar.

I guarantee it. 
Please don't take this the wrong way, but this is Metal as Fuck.

1)  Mom is true bad ass  
2)  Who brings 5yo to a late night ~~death metal~~ rock concert.   Coolest mom ever, thats who.  
3)  This kid is going to have a truly dark experience growing up.  

I really hope that his family is there for him. I honestly can't think of anything more traumatic.

Keep rocking little dude.   Your momma seriously loves you.
Is there anything more valuable than a mother?

Imagine being covered with your mothers blood at any age? It would destroy you.

I feel devastated for the kid.
The bravery of the citizens of Paris is beyond words
Oh, you mean she didn't use her 5 year old as a human shield? 
Kid now has a strange scar and will grow up to defeat ISIS.
It's awesome to see people have the courage to do something as brave as that in situations like these. Very selfless of her.
I don't know how to feel about this, as the media is ruthlessly feeding on this person's sacrifice.
oh god I just need a drink.

eff this news. I am so depressed. I have no words.
I hope that, rather than guilt, this kid grows up knowing that his mom, given a do-over, wouldn't change her actions.  I read the article to see if it worked.  Was still sad at the end, but also relieved to know that the mom succeeded in her attempt to save her son. 
Man, I read the title as "mother uses baby". Thank god that wasn't the case. This lady is a hero. 
People say its wrong to hate them. But I do it anyways. People say to hate them is what they want. But I still do it. People say forgiveness shows we are better than them. But I don't care, I hate them all the same. Hate is a strong word, people say, you want to hurt them? Yes, I do, I hate them. Why,  people ask almost shocked? They deserve it, they deserve to hurt like I hurt, they deserve to feel pain that I feel. But would we be any better than them, people respond? And to this I have no answer.
I dislike stories like this because they're basically grief porn: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mourning_sickness#Media_.22grief_porn.22
  
I can't begin to imagine the kinds of tragedies that are related to the attacks, and in fact, I'd rather not even try to do so. I think it's really distasteful how the media goes out of its way to look for the most horrific tragedies and how they describe them in detail in order to get clicks.
I made the horrible mistake of looking at the photographs of the aftermath of the Bataclan massacre.    I've seen a lot of gruesome images in my many years on the internet, but one in particular was utterly disturbing.    I cannot even begin to comprehend what the survivors are going through.  


Oh my god this is so effing sad |:
fucking hurts to read this :(
I hope this kid grows up to be a famous Metal singer who moonlights as an assassin who kills terrorists that the CIA/FBI can't track.
What a hero.
This is so heartbreaking.. I feel like crying
Probably the most noble/valiant way to die, ever.
Sad that a post on Reddit made me think of her, but I'm going to go ahead and call my mom.
I'm a father this article really struck a nerve, but at the same time who takes a 5 year old to a rock concert?
Hug your mother, everybody. 
RIP. Mothers deserve so much respect and I regret not being nicer to mine. 
And this is why we'll always win.  Love &gt; hatred.
My mom and dad only live 2 hours away from Orlando where I am, but I'm gonna give them a call now.
That's the difference between us and them. She gives her life shielding her child from danger. They strap suicide bombs on theirs.
First thought: Well done mom/grandma. RIP.

Second thought: Pretty cool mom and grandma for taking him to an Eagles of Death Metal concert!
Let’s hope that he is not deeply traumatized by what happened and grows to be as strong and courageous as his mum and grandma.  
which is the opposite as the type of people who do this that use women and children as their human shields.
The more I read about these attacks, the more infuriated I become. 

Unfortunately, I don't know of any way to defeat IS other than a prolonged ground campaign with at least 300,000 troops, at least 100,000 of whom *must* come from neighboring arab countries... otherwise we'll end up repeating iraq and afghanistan, occupying a region of the world where we are not wanted. 
This is truly heartbreaking.
Relieved to read that her son survived.
Damn .... If ISIS sadly still walk this earth by the time he's 18 ... God help them ... Revenge can be sweet. I hope he can get the justice he deserves to dish out to his mothers killers. 

In this world no one is safe , the next decade will be rocky to say the least .... 
Honestly, any isis sympathizers should be ostracized and booted out. Forget free speech, theres a point where this shit shouldnt be humored. 
#REFUGEESWELCOME
Those heartless IS terrorists would rather take rheir children and wife(s) as a shield than taking a bullet themselves... rip brave ladies
God that is heartbreaking. And enraging.
THANKS ISLAM!
Dexter, that you? 
when i was a child leaving my mom to go to school i used to cry cant imagine having to loose your mom at that age. 

This may be insensitive but this kid could grow up to be the Muggle version of Harry Potter.
Obviusly tragic, but as far as deaths go, that's pretty bad-ass. Chances are I'll die watching tv in my underwear.
Just. Fucking. Heartbreaking. So sad that all over the world that people are having to go through this. One of my friends said it best, we may not agree, but we can be kind to one another. This is the embodiment of that. He is a better person than I. Would have such a hard time with that. 
How fucking sick do you have to be to shoot at a five year old. Seriously fuck these people
Very cute kid!
Jesus fucking wept!  
Appologies in advance but I'm skeptical by nature. 

Is this type of story sometimes maybe... an attempt to construct a hero narrative to make people feel warm and fuzzy?

When think of the chaos that must unfold in an event like this it seems like there would be easy opportunities to walk into the aftermath and pretty much tell any story we want. 

Similar to how a doctor might tell a family member that their loved one died quick and painlessly when he knows that the death would have been agonizing and slow.

I don't mean this in any way to be offensive I'm just curious.
Chilean heritage, French nationals...that hits scarily close to home. 
I am so tired of news like this. Shooting sprees every month in the US, terrorist attacks across the world. Innocent lives being destroyed and families and communities being ripped apart day after day after day. For what? Petty grabs for power? God? Money? Humans pride themselves on how advanced they are, yet sometimes we act like the lowest, most brutish beasts imaginable. But we are capable of so much more than this. 
....and so began the story of batman....
WTF was a 5 yr old doing there? Is nobody curious about that? This is a weird story.
I'm not critiquing the story as I haven't read it. I just wish to ask are we taking ***any*** Indian news source as legitimate considering the report by JS that showed how inherently corrupt and ridiculous the Indian Media and how it fabricates stories to sell their newspaper better because of intention competition and is at every level?
Wow, my mind needs more coffee..somehow I read the headline as she used her child as a shield..

Sad news never ends..
I want every single terrorist slaughtered. All of them.
Simply, fuck ISIS. I hope justice is supreme.
wtf the attack itself was world news this is just sentimental click bait
I read 'body' as 'baby' and was horrified.
Quite frankly body isn't much of a shield vs assault rifle at close ranges.
Every article makes me yearn even more for our leaders to grow the balls to wipe Raqqa off the map with our most powerful bomb. 

This is a war of cultures and ideology.  It is time to declare war and simply wipe them out.  There has got to be an end game solution to stop these sick fucks.
I wonder if these losers were on drugs? I saw a documentary on Daesh one time where most of it's army were hopped up on heroin in order to do their disgusting dirty work and be able to kill people without any feeling. I wonder be surprised if these guys did the same.
Every time that kid hears the word Allah he is going to want to punch someone in the face.
If only there had been some sort of wall between her and the Muslim killers....
Why is this news? 
Oh geez, I read that at first as "mother uses five-year-old son to shield her from bullets"
My mom would probably expect me to jump in front of them for her instead and if we both survived, rail me to the end of time for being an ungrateful piece of shit. Kinda drunk.
[deleted]
Am I the only one who finds it strange that a 5 year old was at a death metal concert with mom and gam gam?
Moms are heroes.  
This really struck a chord with me. 
&gt;In a Facebook post, French journalist Antoine Leiris, whose wife Helene Muyal-Leiris also died in the Bataclan attack, said "you will not have my hatred".
He said: "I don't know who you are and I don't want to know, you are dead souls. If this God for whom you kill blindly made us in his image, every bullet in the body of my wife is a wound in his heart.
"So no, I will not give you the satisfaction of hating you. You want it, but to respond to hatred with anger would be to give in to the same ignorance that made you what you are."

I don't think I could be as level headed if my SO was just murdered in cold blood.


Terrible :( wait, the five-year old was at the concert with his mother? 
These stories make people weep. What good does pulling off demonic stunts to appease a false ideology cloaked under another religion do? They'll burn in eternal damnation for executing the innocent.
ayy
Pics or it didn't happen. 
I'm kind of surprised nobody's said anything about Harry Potter yet.

Still, this is amazing.
It really feels like Bill Pullman in ID4 when he has his mind meld with the alien and then his secret service people shoot and kill the alien. 

And then with more understanding he emerges from his stupor and says "Wipe them all out" or something... 

These terrorists aren't humans anymore. We should not even bother incarcerating them. Just wipe them out completely so there is no more trace of them or their hateful ideology left. 
This Paris attack really hit home for me. I don't live in Paris, or a big city. I was alive when the 9/11 attacks happened in America, but don't remember being really sad, scared or mad. The only thing that's changed is I have a family. I could seem me, my two sons, daughter and wife at a soccer match. Watching the game blissfully. Then, out of now where, the bomb goes off. We could be having lunch at one of our local spots. Sitting outside eating a burger and fries when a non-suspicious car pulls up and kills them. We could've been at a concert hall listening to the band, when someone walks in and changes our lives forever. Every time I read a story about these people I'm overwhelmed with emotions. I'm not a man who cries or shares his emotions often, but the attacks that happened last Friday hit a chord in me. I couldn't read this article, because I would've started balling at work. This sort of act just makes these attacks personal to me, because I could see myself doing the exact same thing.
Heartbreaking.
This makes me fucking angry.
That is selflessness and valor. Sadly struck down by selfish cowards. 

Let us not forget the cowards who are doing these attacks are afraid of fighting. They leave their homeland and the proper war to target helpless people, and when faced with soldiers or police they commit suicide. 

That's how we need to remember them. As the cowards they are. 
The only thing ISIS has become successful at is causing the world to join in, against them.  
I don't think I can read the news anymore. There's absolutely nothing I could have done but yet I feel so horrible after reading about things like these.
The father's response is remarkably beautiful and more powerful than any of the "dead souls" who kill. Kudos. 

Edit: a word
Lily Potter?
He shall defeat the dark lord 
Oh fuck, that kid is going to be so fucked up. I can't even fathom to begin to imagine how horrendous... What the fuck.
I wish I believed in heaven.
And the first Anti-terrorism Super Hero is born
That's so fucked... Like... Yeah he survived, but fuck my life, that would be something to live with.
The kid will remeber his parents as a hero, if it were the kid that were shot I believe the mother would be quite depressed. Rest in peace my love, stay strong ;)
This is some Harry Potter shit right here. 
Too many parents dying. Too many children dying. Too many people dying. Too much crying.
And so begins the story of Harry Potter.

In all seriousness, may she rest in peace.
I can't imagine how scarring that would be, for a person to go through that at age 5.
WHAT ABOUT THE ATTACKS IN LEBANON AND KENYA?! /s but seriously, this is horrible.
Hope I have the courage to do this for my kid if needed, rest in peace mamas.
When tragic attacks occur, the event shocks me; then I hear the individual stories, and I cry.
Man I cant imagine how messed up that kids life is now. 
[A suspicious claim, but I'm sure there's a bit more to it and it was worded that way for sentimental value.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BulletproofHumanShield)
Unless they're hollow points, there's a good chance throwing yourself in front of them isn't helping anybody.
woah woah woah stop the clock here. A mother and grandmother took a 5 year old to an Eagles of Death Metal concert?

sounds fishy to me. If its true, its horrible and so so sad. I have a child of my own and I would do the same in an instant. I just have a hard time believing the media at this point. 
Oh fuck your stupid TV show. People died here.
Pathetic 
All respect to those involved but it says something about France (I'm not sure what) that grandma and a five year old were at a death metal concert.
I'm not a mom nor Parisian but I have mourned with them since Friday. My heart hurts with every story of Friday's events. 
Love will win. Stories like this prove that.  
As a father, I wouldn't hesitate to do the exact same thing. My only wish in this life is to have my children live longer than me.
I'm sorry but, why is this making headlines?
i'm crying
Except, not really. The 7.62X39 used fires a heavy bullet in a steel jacket (assuming military surplus, which is almost certain). In this demonstration (link at bottom) the same bullet used in AK-47 rifles is shot through 12 inches of wood and a cast iron frying pan. These bullets pass completely through human bodies.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RODu_dmJO_M
When I read this I think nuke that whole fucking region but I know that's not right. Ughhh is there any way to end this or is it just gonna keep happening
You're missing the point. This was a moment of respect for the innocent dead and deserves reverence, *no matter the circumstances*. A moment of silence for the dead in Beirut, or Nigeria, or anywhere deserves that same respect.
I'm a friend of Elsa.
I'm seriously pissed of at this article.
Her brother asked everyone to NOT ANSWER to any interview, in order to protect Louis.
Bitch couldn't keep her mouth shut.
This is just depressing.  
Man, I read that wrong. Replace "body" with "baby" and it completely changed the narrative.
Is there a way how we can help this kid?
Doesn't really shield the boy. The terrorist just missed. 7.62x39 will go through several unprotected people.
A five-year old at a rock concert?
TIL that a 5 year-old, a 35 year-old and a 61 year-old attend the same concert
Is anyone else extremely curious at how the 5 year old managed to get out alive? Did someone see him and grab him to help him out after? Did he hide under his dead mother and grandmother until it was over? I'm in shock that he was able to survive! Poor kid, going to live with that horror forever. I hope it makes him stronger and he grows up to do something wonderful. 
This is very sad.
Henri Potter?
How don't the bullets go through her into him? I've shoot through medium sized trees with ak-47s before o feel like it would pass through her pretty easy and keep going 
All I see are frightened people made crazy.  Those who'd do anything to hurt people and those who'd do anything to save them.  We need a new song and dance.
What the fuck man, this bothers me...
This is.. it's so fucking sad. I can't even comprehend all of it. It's just fucking sad. 
This just makes me angry and sad.
That is the most positive thing I have heard, all year............
I don't get along with my mom, so I have to think about my dad to relate to this story. He passed away last year and I can't imagine the guild I'd feel if he died saving me. Losing him pretty much destroyed me and if I had to choose between dying and losing him, I'd jump in front of that bullet personally without a second thought.

I hope the kid is too young to remember much of this incident, and that he gets into therapy immediately. Fortunately I think France has a pretty good healthcare system. He'll probably be taken care of.
Was that boy Harry Potter?

I'm so sorry that's really inappropriate 
Who is cutting the onions. 
Are AK bullets not enough to go through multiple people?
she played the cello, i play the cello, something about that makes me cry. RIP, you saved your child and grandchild, you were brave women who won't be forgotten.
I read the title as "using her baby" at first
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34862437

I found this reading of Antoine Leiris' message very powerful. A dignified middle finger.
This is so sad and so bitter sweet. A mother and her child died. What an abrupt end to their lives. Yet bittersweet because their bloodline will continue.

These are the types of people that should never have been taken, it's a shame and really brings a tear to my eye.

Why on earth is a 5 year old at a death metal concert.
Who wouldn't do that?  Seriously.  I doubt anyone I know wouldn't istinctively shield their kids from harm.
It's just so sad, and the beauty of true love; I wanna go cry as a dad and hug my kids now
Mothers' love for their children is known as the best thing on earth for a reason. This is sad. Rest in Peace, mother and grandmother of the child.

I would never want my mom to get shot and killed for me. Filthy terrorists.
If my mom wanted to take a bullet for me, I'd just move her away :,(
I thought I was emotionless, but after reading this I can feel the pain.
Why was a FIVE year old kid in a Death Metal Concert?
Caitlyn Jenner is somehow still the most brave woman. WTF! 
Would it actually work? AFIK a Kalashnikov rifle bullet would easily penetrate 2 bodies?
Daesh is a horrible terrorist group. I'm pretty sure Allah doesn't want people to be murdered. If he does than he is a shitty god. We need to send women to kill Daesh soldiers, that way no 72 virgins for them.
Why was a 5-year-old at a rock concert, though?
it's early and i read that as "mother died using her BABY to shield her five year old son from bullets"
Yet people still support "immigration" of "Refugees".

It's funny how a story gets sympathy but nobody wants to take the next step not support the broken ideas that caused the story.
weak
A five-year-old was at an Eagles of Death Metal concert with his mom and grandmother?  Their sacrifice is amazing and I feel sorry for that child but that seems a little odd.  
Hope that kid crusades for vengance
May God glorify that mother, while the boy will grow up without a mother, at least he will always know how much he was loved by her, that she was willing to give up her life for him. 
The play was to use her five-year-old son as a shield, not the other way around.
lol. Meat shield.
..as the boy grows up filled with hatred, he will seek a way to find revenge and hurt innocent people. Thus, the cycle never ends. 
Why the fuck is a 5 year old at an eagles of death metal concert?
If god we are going to see these kinds of fucking posts for weeks, aren't we?
They're not to be hated; they're to be methodically rounded up and exterminated, like one would a rabid dog. Rabid dogs don't get trials, by the way...
Don't get in a butt kicking competition with a porcupine.   Especially as that particular porcupine has a "kill them all and let the devil sort them out" mentality.  
ISIS is only going to strengthen ties between all of the countries that they target. They going to attack China next?
So I guess they don't remember the last time terrorists tried taking over a theater in russia.  The Russians don't take prisoners, they gassed everyone in the theater. 
In winter? These guys dont understand history.

ISIS is about to join a very exclusive club, consisting of just Napoleon and Hitler. 
Very soon... Sounds like me when I'm procrastinating
Attack both nato and russia. 

This is way too stupid to be true.
I really don't want to see Russians get attacked by ISIS, but I wholeheartedly want to see the wrath of Putin come down on all terrorists like a sledge hammer.
Are we in the 80s? Proxy wars with Russia, afganistan 2.0
gl hf
I think I'll put on some Mussorgsky while this plays out. 


lmao if ISIS didn't burn all the history books they found in the middle east they'd know why this is the worst idea ever
I'm just gonna sit here and wait for this. Do I think that the loss of life in Russians would be bad? Yeh. Do I think the Russians would level the Middle East in response? Yep.
You reeeeeaaaally don't wanna poke the bear.
Don't poke a sleeping bear.
Attacking Russia?! It's like these guys are suicid- oh wait...
im guessing the site is getting ddos'd or just overloaded?  [here is the story on another website](http://newschannel9.com/news/top-stories/stories/new-isis-video-threatens-attack-russia-blood-spill-22077.shtml)
I hope Russia fucks them the hell up.
Honestly I would be more scared of Russia than the US.

US has a huge political base to worry about any sort of serious military action. But I can see Russia just goes in and fuck everyone up without even considering what the public thinks.
The motherland will erase them.
Have fun with that one. If there's one country you don't fuck with, it's Russia.
If ISIS pulls a Paris in Russia and they will be steamrolled like Chechnya was.
If the IS attack Russia the reaction is going to be like after the aliens attacked in Independence Day. Every country in the world will band together to destroy them. The world is getting tired of this bullshit.
I am a historian and have read a lot about the Soviet Union.
What they endured is beyond comprehension in terms of lives lost and destruction during the Second World War. They make a very big deal of celebrating their victory of Nazi Germany for a reason. They become a military superpower because they were going to make shit sure that NO ONE would ever try that again. So for these piss ants called ISIS to make threats? Don't expect to survive for much longer. You have your small victories now but in the end expect to be woodchippered into animal entrails...
Дуракам закон не писан.
I wonder what all those young, stupid kids that have joined ISIS via twitter and shit are feeling right now. Like. Your little club that you joined out of rebellion or ignorance or whatever the fuck is revving up some serious war engines with the world powers right now. And you have to know, deep down in your heart, that you guys won't win. Like. Isn't that scary? Putin. Hollande. Obama. And everyone else is getting ready to fuck you right up. You're done. For life. 

You had all of it ahead of you, everything, you could've done something wonderful with this life you were given, made great art, found someone beautiful to share your life with, raised great kids. You could've been somebody. And it's done, even if you don't die, it's all done, and you're doomed to this shit life.

And for what? Pussy? Money? Adrenaline? Hatred of others for being different? Because it damn sure wasn't out of dedication to Islam and you're bullshitting if you say that. I feel bad for you guys. I really do. I hope you guys change. I hope you get out somehow, if you can. I used to think you guys were actually not as bad as the shithead cartels in Mexico and South America, but now I'm not so sure.

Praying for you, and for those innocent people you hurt, not just in France, but everywhere. 
These crazy bastards think fighting America and all it's PC sensitivity is bad? Just wait until they fight the army that won't hesitate to depopulate entire provinces in order to eliminate their opposition.
1, 2, 3, 4, lets start a nuclear war


Seems like a bad idea to threaten a country like Russia
That's a bold strategy cotton, let's see if it pays off. 
Russia isn't a country to fuck with in the slightest. You piss off the bear, you better be prepared to get mauled, and by mauled, I mean see your organization systematically eradicated as they kill every person who doesn't absolutely renounce Islamic terrorist groups. Russia gases hostages to end standoffs and shoots their own soldiers for retreating, so they're not likely to value the lives of a bunch of cowards hiding behind a religion
Everyone in this thread is assuming that ISIS will have a ground invasion when in reality it'll be bombers and randoms with weapons 
Empty threat, they'd never have the balls to try what they did in Paris in Moscow or St. Petersburg. Because if they did the Russians would turn Raqqa to glass before they knew it.
Part of me wants to just say fuck it, give it a months time to secretly (or as secretly as possible) to evacuate as many civilians as possible and then blow that entire region's worth of known terrorist locations to rubble... While the other part of me says there's gotta be a smarter way... Some unifying truth or something like that. Idk.
Russia. The quagmire that ISIS **deserves.**

Russia doesn't give a flying fuck about who they kill to get their objectives met.  Hiding behind kiddos or mosques will not work.
Hey guys, remember that actual human beings live in Russia. As cool as it would be to see ISIS taken out, it would be better if that could come without putting even more lives at risk. Just because it's not your country, it doesn't mean it's some kind of experiment where if it goes well, okay, and if it doesn't, whatever. ISIS attacking Russia has consequences for the human beings who live there.
Please do. Then you will soon be nothing but a bad memory. 
Why is Russia being praised on Reddit as Gods of Warfare?
Wow, so many people in this threat don't understand what terrorism is. They don't need to fight, or win, a war with Russia to cause a fucking mess. Get your heads out of your asses with all this macho "Russia will mess them up" shit. This isn't WWII.
They're going to keep talking about striking nations just to scare the public. 
I can't view the article as the site's server is down, but has it occurred to anyone that IS is bluffing or trying to misdirect us? Earlier this year, they were saying "hey we're gonna attack Italy." It was all over the media. But instead, they attacked France. I don't think it's too far-fetched to say that the threat on Italy was a deliberate diversion to draw attention away from their plan to attack France. And now they (may) be trying the same thing again.
If they fuck with Russia, then they're going to have to deal with China. They already signed their death warrant when they decided to fuck with an ally of NATO, I think it's becoming more and more clear that ISIS's true enemy is...ISIS.
Note to ISIS, do not poke the bear.
History shows it's a good idea to fuck with the Russians. Then again, I serously doubt ISIS has read any history books. Or any book for that matter.
The worst move ISIS could make aside from targeting the USA.
Ha. Because the last time someone opted to attack Russia, it went super well. 
These fuckers *want* to be bombed. Since they're trying to act as a state and hold territory, I have no idea why.
Well, this should pan out to be ISIS' biggest mistake...
How Russians deal with threats:
http://articles.latimes.com/1986-01-07/news/mn-13892_1_soviets
Read the title, came to post something along the lines of "i fucking dare you" but youbguys got it locked down already.

On another note, if they do hit russia, and russia does exactly what people assume they will do, then i highly suggest any and all peaceful muslims to get out now.
Maybe this will make Russia hit more IS targets and less of Assad's enemies.
You do not fuck bear. Bear fuck you instead.
Oh please, get Putin and the Russians angry.    Please piss off someone who won't give a fuck what anyone thinks about how they respond.   Please do it, put the noose around your own necks.
Attacking France? France has some decency and the people have good moral compasses. Attacking Russia? Russia will fucking turn your desert into glass and execute you on local tv, they don't give a shit what the rest of the world will have to say about it. 
In the winter? Go for it. Usually ends well.
Rest in pieces,  twats.
[russia has released a statement regarding the ISIS threat](http://i.imgur.com/rhuRa8w.gif)
one way ticket to a nuke
Bombing them (ISIS) on the field is just half the battle.
They have hidden operatives embedded in the community.
And any misguided youth is a potential weapon against the innocent. The second half of the war against this is finding corporations/companies aiding directly and indirectly that allows ISIS to recruit, infiltrate society. Russia is most likely also focusing on street level battle to find out the seeds.
"The Russians aren't gonna let this massacre go unanswered. It's gonna get bloody."

"Too right mate. Now in the eyes of the world they're the victims. And nobody's going to say a word when they club every [IS] they can reach."
What I don't get is why the whole developed world doesn't just stop for a moment and say, "OK, we're all going to chip in and curb stomp this group." That we don't squash a midget endlessly spoiling for a fight and committing atrocities that are at NAZI-level (i.e., 5 Stars), shows that we're more interested in strategic interests in the region than in dealing with a group that keeps begging to be dealt with. 
Ah the good ole reddit hug of death.
Looks at calendar 

Yup it's around that time for another Russian invasion mistake
That is a *brilliant* idea....go for it.


But for serious, Russia would rip them apart in moments. Hostage situation? Nerve gas the whole place. Rebels in the apartment complex? No need for special forces, we will just use tanks. 


Russia will destroy anything that is left of you. Good luck fighting against the north fury when you're too busy fighting the north wind.
Russia has been itching to have a real foe since the whole Cold War thing.

Yoy may bite off more than you can chew there ISIS.
It's pretty much winter. I'm glad ISIS have no respect for history. 
IS wants WW3...
This may have been posted already. But we're in November. There's one simple rule when taking on Russia. You never march on Russia in the winter. 
Capture that one rock in Mecca. 
Russia is going to fucking RAPE them.
RIPieces ISIS... You sons of bitches just thought you were WAY too big for your britches...
They're so dumb they'll attempt it in winter
Putin: "LOL, K."
Russia has had terrorist attacks before and they didn't cleanse the world of terrorism. Why does everyone think this will be any different?
They generally bluster like this because they have no actual leverage in Russia is how I interpret this. Notice how there was no threat to Paris because they didn't want people on the alert? I think this may have been a misdirection tactic. Idk I'm not an expert but I find it improbable -- stay safe though no matter what everyone. Sending you my love in the aftermath of this senseless violence.
https://imgur.com/Q5DNNs1
Ive said it before.  Russia will be the one to end this madness by doing something completely horrific. We will publicly condemn them for it,  but privately thank them. 
I thought they already did? (Metrojet 9268)
Are they seriously trying to attack Russia in winter?
What a horrible mistake, Russia don't give a bleeping fuck about political correctness and will crush them like little snowmen.
They're about to bring piss to a shit fight. 
As Russian I would like to thank ISIS that statement. It gave me a good laugh today and I really needed it since I had pay a lot more than I expected for a car repair. 

Time to take shit now and wipe my ass with pages from a Koran
The countries I would never carry out a terrorist attack in: Russia, China and Texas.
Do it! Russia will fuck you up. They don't give a fuck about all that "hearts and minds" bullshit. 
Desert people attacking Russia in the winter. What could go wrong?
It is kinda sad that people are now thinking Russia is badass and romanticizing Putin just because their own governments have become so impotent.
A lot of Call of Duty based disillusionment here. 
Russians are almost as crazy as Texans....but hey, its your funeral.
Smart, attack France, a capital and symbolic EU country, after having taken down a Russian aircraft with hundreds of civilians on board.

France and Russia alone can and will crush ISIL.  Now NATO and the world are enraged, ISIL has made the biggest error in their campaign so far.  Hitting the European homeland will bring nothing but a rain of Western and Russian firepower.

ISIL has zero chance against the Russians, China, NATO/EU/US/Commonwealth
If they soon hit russia they just confirmed they didnt bring down the arliner?
This is a really interesting article about how Russia deals with terror:

http://articles.philly.com/1986-01-15/news/26052630_1_hostage-crisis-soviet-captives-islamic-liberation-organization
But... it's about to be winter. And they already don't like you. I hope Russia is able to prevent these attacks, and also lay waste to these walking pieces of shit.
The naivete of many of those commenting here is mind boggling. As if the US is reticent in killing people when it feels the need to do so, which has been quite often. Seriously, now many wedding parties have we taken out? Didn't we invade and destroy an entire country (Iraq) based on trumped up evidence that anyone with a brain knew to be false? Weren't out soldiers routinely 'lighting up' any vehicle that failed to obey their instructions at checkpoints? Google some of those photos if you have a strong stomach.  Wasn't the US the country that dropped pesticides in lethal amounts on the Vietnamese countryside repeatedly and for years despite being told that what they were doing was going to kill people and have effects for years to come? Didn't the US support a secret program in Vietnam surreptitiously killed civilians thought to be sympathetic to the Viet Cong (Phoenix Program)? Wasn't the US the country that dropped more bombs on rural Laos than they did during WWII? Wasn't it the US that armed and supported Islamic fundamentalists so that they could overthrow a secular government in Afghanistan, and go on to spread their terror up until this very day. I could go on literally for pages with far worse stuff, but where the fuck does this idea that the US government behaves in some sort of cuddly matter compared to the Soviets come from? Fox News?
Putin fucks bears for fun, please ISIS go fuck with Russia 
Don't wake the bear.
Redditors are in general are very silly group of individuals. Russia was getting pot shotted and frustrated by Mujaheddin in Afghanistan. The Chechens have been able to survive for decades dealing with Russia. It is a massively foolish assertion to believe that Russia would just "rek shit" against ISIS. 
Russia should deal with them as they did the animals in Chechnya.  That is what they understand, and there is no moral culpability for putting them down since they are being "martyred" anyway.
Good. I can't wait to see what a government who doesn't play bullshit games does about this. No Operation: *Enduring Freedom*, instead it should of been, and from the start, Operation: *Scorched Fucking Earth! We're Tired of These Fucking Games. You Believe In God So Bad, Go Fucking See Him!*

Before you all get all huffy, sure, Russia is shady and a bit oppressive. What government isn't? Some are just better at hiding it than others. The thing I admire about Russia, is they still have spines. They arn't worried about hurting someones feelings. Hurt feelings is the new holocaust-esque war crime these days. Generations of everyone getting a trophy and no one being told the truth.  The truth being that in school, they should of been told they are a little stupid, instead of lowering the bar so everyone wins.
I hope its not happening but there are 17 million of Muslims in Russia and almost 2200 Russians joined ISIS in Syria and Iraq...
I wonder, will be people be open and caring for Russia? 
Why? I guess I don't understand what their goal is. Are they just out to do a much damage to everyone they can? Are they all just children having temper tantrums with machine guns? Someone bring my up to speed.
Palmyra offensive is coming real soon,that is why terrorists are making threats against Russia.
If they follow through with this threat, then not even Allah himself could protect them from the hell Putin will unleash on them.
Do you want to die brutally... because that's how you die brutally.
Never invade Russia in the winter
Have fun with that one. If there's one country you don't fuck with, it's Russia.
Don't wake the bear.
Yeah Russia is one country they should not fuck with. 
Given the number of Muslims living in Russia and who have traveled to fight for ISIS....I think it isn't unlikely.  There certainly could be a few bombings by terrorists - a lot of animosity between many muslims in central Asia and Russia.
I hope they don't, I actually respect Russians.
Yeah this is when ISIS dies.
Don't poke the bear 
That's nice. Another emotional reaction by the manipulators of emotions. That's cool, I guess. Except for the part where emotionally I think that's stupid and very... monkey but hey, welcome to our intellect experiencing our biological animal called human. 

Or, fucking, Meh. 
Did you all forget that Russia is already involved in Syria-- which is probably why they are targeting them? Don't be silly enough to expect some grand offensive and glorious bear-riding retribution.  
  
More people are going to die.  
Today I was thinking, "If ISIS decides to attack Russia, they're fucked." Oh man, it's happening sooner than I thought. I hope the maggots puke on your corpse, ISIS.
inb4 

"IS Surrenders, how Russian Tactical Nukes prevented WWIII"
It's like they want the super powers of the world against them. Next they'll want to attack China.
In Soviet Russia, Suicidal go ISIS.
Really ISIS? You, an organization within a religious state based in one of the hottest places on Earth, intend to rage war Russia near the peak of winter? ...Sure, why not? There have been similar successful attempts before. /sGood fucking luck, dipshits.
Has ISIS forgotten the soviets created something called the Tsar bomb? 
Oh this is going to be good...
So I guess that bomb on that plane *wasn't* ISIS?
Don't get in a butt kicking competition with a porcupine.   Especially as that particular porcupine has a "kill them all and let the devil sort them out" mentality.  
do it you fuckers, I wanna see each and everyone of you dead and frozen under Russian soil
Yeahhhhh good luck with the repercussions of that.
i dont get it... not even the americans were stupid enough to mess with the russians, but hey.. piss in the wasps nest if it solves our problem.
Seems like everyone thinks ISIS is "going to make the same mistake" as those who tried to invade in the past. They're not going to invade, they're going to do the same thing that just happened in Paris. That's not how ISIS fights, and they know they're not going to win that way. 
If the IS attack Russia the reaction is going to be like after the aliens attacked in Independence Day. Every country in the world will band together to destroy them. The world is getting tired of this bullshit.
Funny how the top comments are like " you don't mess with Russia " as if Russia will take care of them and are heroes . Russia will kills tons of civilians to get to ISIS and that's ok? US used the best precision munitions in the world and people cry foul at every turn for civies killed. 

Russia gets a free pass cuz they don't care about collateral damage.....cool

I honestly would love to see them try. If they attack Russia, it will be the beginning of the end of Fundamental Islam.
Wew lad.

That may be an error. Russia doesn't play ball with kid gloves.


This is how the ISIS learns about radiation therapy.
pls do what you must to make Putin angry.
Fuck those guys
Isis claims they'll strike Russia. Russia cracks down on Muslims in country. Russian Muslims hate Russia more. Isis uses to recruit more people in Russia.
Russia, as a Muslim who's sick of all post 9/11 events and the impact it's had primarily on Muslims (and also non-Muslims alike), nuke these bastards! 14 years, and the world hasn't really seen a reduction in these events.

Just don't get hurt along the way.
Y'all need to delete your comments about Russia in the winter before Isis sees them and takes note.
Yeah, here's the deal. The Russians have a long, LONG history of dealing with religious incursions and attacks on their homeland. One lesson this American can give- Don't fuck with Russia with your religion unless you want them to make you go away. Permanently.
Of all the 1st world countries to fuck with, Russia would be at the bottom of my list. A pissed off Russia is waaaaaay worse than the US.



RIP IS
lol, alright ISIS, poke the bear as much as you want.
Yah that's gonna go well for you
Russia: no you won't 
Why would they wait until the start of Winter to attack Russia?
If ISIS hits Russia in any meaningful way.... I don't even want to think about how badly Russia will fuck them.  Screwing with the US is one thing, but you have to be insane to screw with Russia.  They have less to lose than the US by being heavy handed.  It's what they're known for, and I think that's a good thing.  I would also hope that the US would take this as a chance to work with the Russians to get rid of ISIS.  Our military's need to cooperate more.
Don't worry obama said they are contained.  
not that i approve of such violence, but if they attack russia, there wont be a middle east.
Wow. They just want to die now don't they.
Strategically speaking, that was Hitler's big mistake wasn't it?
I have worked with Russians on a fishing boat and have seen first hand that you DO NOT threaten a Russian.
Ohhh They *really* don't want to do that.  
Russia won't be nice to them if shit happens and I am quite sure every down to earth Muslim is scared of this fact.

The treatment of Muslims in the USA post 911 will look like child's play compared to what the Russians will do. Just one of those things that is best to "cut off" ASAP and the west has failed horribly at "controlling" this despite all the money thrown at it. 
Fighting Europe, America, and Russia at the same time has historically only been successful. Right?
No, they won" t.
Yeah have fun with that lads.
Okay CIA.. Settle down
So even in light of the Paris attacks reddit doesn't take this seriously? How can everyone be so blasé about people dying?
I am flying to Russia in a week. And I have confused feelings: "Well, shit, this is worrying...but...ah come on it's Russia, they don't give a fuck about what's racist what not, they will check everyone and everything up...god damn it and I really don't look like Russian, to them I look like a fucking southerner...god damn it, I'm fucked either way"
Russia? In the winter?

Okay, yeah, good luck with all that.

Maybe you guys should start learning from history instead of trying to destroy it.
Didn't they say this exact same thing last year?
Good News! Russia will eradicate ISIS and US\EU\Russia are all friends again by the end of it all. Economies will again flourish!
ISIS knows that Russia doesn't have a politically correct bone in its body right? They won't give a fuck about muslims in the country if ISIS started trying to do shit.
Good luck
That would be a bad idea. Putin would respond with lots of deadly force.
I hope they do, Russia won't fuck around with these people like the USA does...

Putin won't tie one hand behind his back like the US does
Reality is this, ISIS will continue doing ignorant shit attacking countries until they get their hands on one of those small nukes...

They will set it off, tens of millions, if not 100's of millions of people will die, and then all hell will rain down on the middle East, and the Muslim religion will die a fast death as the world says fuck it, don't care if you are extreme or not, you guys are out
Didn't they just down a plane an kill 224 people?
This is the same nation that took the strongest pain medicine know to man (Carfentanyl) and aerosolized it, turning it in to a weapon and used it in hostage situation resolution. Fucking Russians are brutal, but really effective.
Putin be like 

http://i.imgur.com/HPxf2hw.jpg
Yes lets poke the big red "I don't give a fuck" bear and see what happens. As much as I don't wanna see more bloodshed, I would love Isis be decimated by these guys. 
That's uhh, that's not a good plan. Russia, as bad as it is, is no holds barred in their retaliations, they do t give a fuck what the rest of the world thinks about them and will do anything 
As an Azerbaijanian, being stuck with around those two frightens me.
Terrorists thrive on fear and they need mass media in order to propagate their acts. The obvious answer for the Russians, French, etc. is to kidnap such terrorist suspects and just go medieval on their asses. Pliers, blowtorches, saws, you name it. Film the experience and post it on the net. The more, the better. So one day Muslimboy doesn't show up at the mosque. The next day he's being gutted alive on youtube, screaming and begging for mercy. Way to drive home a point - this may happen to you too.
Saudi Arabia and Turkey both fund and arm ISIS. And the US is allies with both of them. ISIS is a back burner issue compared to making sure Assad is gone so they can build their pipeline to Europe

Why don't you hit Israel? Can't annoy the boss?
This headline strikes me as funny - maybe I just don't care anymore but it sounds like daesh is getting lazy.  "Oh you'll get yours yet, Putin - just as soon as we can get off our ass and stop attacking countries that are welcoming us as refugees"

Meanwhile, we'll take more meth (Captagon?) and kill some more Yazidis because you know they're not well armed and they're not Muslim.
So they're planning on fucking with Russia in the winter? Yeah. Good luck with that. That's when Russians go super sayan. 
"This is the best idea and nothing could possibly go wrong!"

But for real, though. You thought America was bad?  Piss off Putin.
https://youtu.be/wt2u4dlZBHE?t=1m10s

"poke the russians, poke the russians, oh god theyre coming"

Carry on Isis, you fucking retards lmao
As much as I dislike Russia due to their corruption and lack of civil rights, would like for them to perform a brutal smackdown on IS.
Daesh don't care about winter. They won't be around long enough to feel it, as they're not planning a long stay. Set bombs, kill people,die and go to heaven is their mantra, so a bit of snow won't slow them down, or make them hesitate. They'll keep throwing bodies at russia to do as much massive damage as possible.

Likewise, russia don't give a shit either. Their jaunt in Syria is about appealing to the "tough guy" perspective in other countries, and trying to put forward the image of the good guys. Don't believe it for a moment. Where Daesh are religious fundamentalists, successive russian governments have a long history of being political fundamentalists and masters of manipulation, with all the savage belligerence, arrogance, and paranoia that goes with that.

They will relentlessly lie and murder without consequence or regret.

Ask the people of Central and Eastern Europe whether russia is a good friend or not. If you include russia in any plans, they will exact a hefty and disproportionate restitution for their participation, as the people of CEE know only too well.

Having lived in russia for some years before returning to europe, and imho, you should trust putin, the russian orthodox church, and the brutal and murderous mafia clans in the government and security forces, about as far as you can throw 4 wild elephants.

They are no better than Daesh on many levels.


Be careful what you wish for.
Good luck with that, you insane fucks.
Everybody has a plan until they punch Russia in the mouth.
i do believe, it's the middle of winter.

what do we know from history to be the result of attacking russia in the middle of winter. anyone?
I'm not to sure what winter in Russia has to do with anything since ISIS doesn't fight a conventional war. They will not attack like the Germans did. I'm sure most ISIS members have been living in Russia for years and established themselves in the community. All ISIS members living in Russia are going to do is leave their warm Russian houses and drive to multiple locations and attack, just like they did in Paris.
this sounds like a really really bad idea from isis and from anyone really 
ISIS reminds me of Steve Irwin.

'Oh that bear looks nasty... I'm gonna poke it!' 
you don't fuck Russians. Russians fuck you.
I honestly cant get mad about this. People are acting like other countries are all clean or this is a big surprise. 

There was a post on Reddit a while back, it had the best 25(50?) ranked 100m times and the runners highlighted who have been caught doping. There was more drugs cheats than clean athletes and from many countries.  

Just need to face the truth, athletics is a dirty sport. 
He said, before turning and slaloming through a team of professional ice hockey players and scoring with a distinctly average shot.
I think they should have a roid Olympics to see how far people can go with the helps of steroids and doping.
What this title doesn't say is that he wants to pursue individuals, and not organisations. 

While the whole issue is inherent to the organisations/ federations.

In other words, we can expect a few token sacrifices, and the federations will walk.
I'm sure this investigation will be very successful.
Oh! As a person who lived in and knows too much about Russian/USSR mentality, those words are useless.

There will be 2 most probable outcomes for this Putin's quote:

1. After this 'investigation' nothing will be found, Russia will call themselves a country clean of doping.
2. Scapegoat will be found, who will be at fault for everything in this situation, there is a small chance of public court for PR reasons, but nothing considerable would be done.

Do you believe that coaches and high ranking officials will come up and say "oh yeah, daddy Putin, we use doping all the times"? 
&gt;A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest.

Just like elections, eh comrade?
"A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."  Has Putin been the only one wrestling the bears fairly?
&gt;"A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."   

I disagree. Just open a doping contest, and a separate one for non-dopers. Once anyone enters the doping contest, they aren't allowed back in the non-doping leagues. Problem solved!
Putin is interested in honest sporting contests but not honest political contests.
And when Putin means investigate, he means investigate who leaked the information.
Looks like False Equivilence is the go to excuse for Putin Bots today. Cute.
Awww such a hero. But crash los gays
Yeah cause that is a reliable source
"Ordered"'
"investigation"
Investigation = bribery.
[Russian Doping?  I'm shocked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME).
Some athletes will visit goulag
Don't worry guys, Vlads gonna look into it. Well finally get an answer for them buff chicks. 
Politics, at least for Putin, does not have that constraint.
...Just like election. [laughs]
How that last murder investigation going?
He doesn't have the same vision of the election process though...
I have suspected widespread doping in Russia for years now.  Haven't these people seen Rocky IV? 
If only he felt the same way about elections 
"Fuck we are caught!" 


Wonder what he thinks of a fair election. Is that still interesting
The political system must be open. An election is only interesting when it is honest.
He's the dirty cop in the department in charge of investigating the dirty cop. 
[Elections, not so much.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Russia#Criticism_of_recent_elections) But sporting contests, yeah those have to be honest.
An investigation into claims?? Russian Olympic athletes being on steroids is so well known to have been going on for so long that it's a cliche joke.
"A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest." says the guy who racks up [7 goals in a hockey game](http://nypost.com/2015/10/07/putin-scores-7-goals-in-hockey-game-on-63rd-birthday/).
He obviously hasn't seen Rocky IV.
He also really wants to find out which Ukrainians shot down that Malaysian airliner.
Hahahahahaha.  That's hilarious.  The Russians running the doping program and going to expose it!
Maybe he can hire Blatter to lead the investigation.
Shame he doesn't feel the same way about elections.... 
He also indicated in his order that all of these excellent steroids must be confiscated for his own.... inspection.
Says the guy that was allowed to score 7 (or was it 8 goals?) In a hockey match. All in good fun, but still, can't help but feel the irony in this call to action.
Yeah sure.

And there are no Russian troops in Ukraine....
Why would anyone believe what Putin says?
A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest.  An election, not so much.
Lol. His entire dictatorship is built on a ceaseless abyss of lies, but I'm sure *this* is the issue they decide to be honest about. 
And a very fine man is he.
The FSB was involved in broad program of doping Russian athletes, and Putin is acting like he didn't know about it? That is incredibly far fetched, but it's not at all out of character for him to brazenly lie, even after he has been caught red handed.
Has anyone brought up Rocky IV yet? There's a joke in there somewhere. Honestly I'm a bit too tired to figure one out. 
I'm beginning to detect a pattern with Putin:

1 - do something bad

2 - get caught

3 - launch a "personal investigation" into how ~~he got caught~~ these bad things happened

4 - state run poll says great leader is most popular leader ever!
Hours later, Vladimir Putin, injection marks in his arm, tells an exasperated WADA agent that he personally has cleared all Russian athletes of any doping claims. He also notes that he will be entering the Mr. Universe tournament next year. 
Are we going to pretend that nobody else is doping? Good job trying to pretend it's the problem that only exists in Russia. 

In the United States, your coaches will put you on steroids once you 'peak' in regards to what you can do on your own even if you are not even close to the Olympics. 

We are talking about college level, etc. You do not need doctors  because coaches know more about this stuff here. 

Just a fun fact.
That's more of an investigation than Alexander Litvinenko ever received. Thank god for non-issues to make issues out of.
... and appoints himself as the head of the investigation. After all charges are cleared later, who dares to question the leader?
After he scored a shitload of goals last year.
The steroids are simply on vacation. The fact that these steroids chose to fight the fascist junta that that overthrew the proper athletic powers just speaks to the brutality of the current Nazi regime. Those needles and designer drugs can be found in any bathroom. America started doping its athletes first. Did I forget to mention the Nazis?
&gt; "A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."

I'm sure he stayed true to those convictions when it came to Russia's World Cup bid, too...
Funny, but not so funny.. The rumored girlfriend of Putin - Alina Kabaeva was one of the best Russian gymnasts the world has ever seen in her sport. She was banned for 10 years in that sport for being drug tested and found positive for diuretics.
How that last murder investigation going?
"we have investigated ourselves and have been found to be absolutely perfect.  No need for anyone to investigate further."
Since this is Reddit, I read "athletes" as "atheists."
"A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."

Haha, OMG the irony! Maybe many of you don't know, but Putin wrote a book on Judo (being a black belt himself). It's crammed with dirty tricks you can pull to give you an edge without being spotted by the referee!

Edit: grammar
says the man who ordered the killing of his political rival not a year ago.
Why does he need an investigation, isn't that what WADA have just completed? This sounds like a delaying tactic to me.

Also why use terms like 'battle' and 'contest' a battle or contest between whom? IAAF / WADA and Russia or the cheats and the clean athletes? I think he's being deliberately vague on that point. 

This is Vladimir Putin we're talking about, no-one farts in Russia without his knowledge so to claim the widespread drug cheating programme happened without his direct or tacit consent is, to me, not credible.
I know I'm going to get downvoted for this due to a lot of pro-putin sentiment... but:

oh come on - putin is no idealist and is full of shit.  at his level, sports is about money and (in the case of the olympics) political currency and contract rewards to his backers.  Remember what a shitshow the Sochi olympics where?   Also:  Russia has a long history of doping.

(yes, even putin has backers that must be paid.  this is how autocracies work)
I actually have a little expertise on this. I am a powerlifter, and have gotten the privilege to speak to some of the Russian lifters. Steroids are MORE common in Russian Powerlifting than US powerlifting, and the US even has "open use" federations. Furthermore, more Russian private citizens (at least according to the person I spoke with) use steroids than American private citizens. It was described to me as being more acceptable, and baked-into the culture there. The person I talked to said it really isn't even taboo, its doing whatever it takes to win. Other countries are doing it, so they try to do it better, and everybody is avoiding being caught. 

So yeah, this is a bullshit attempt by Putin to cover his country's ass. No other country has clean hands either though, there is so much steroid use in professional sports, that if most people knew the true extent, they would probably stop tuning in. A lot of die-hard fans would keep watching but it would no longer be something you encouraged children to do (become pro athletes) in the same way ever agiain. Not saying that's the appropriate response either, you probably know at least 5 steroid users, but would have no idea. Its not just athletes, and most steroid users are normal, nice people.

And before someone asks, no I have never tried steroids, or "gear" as its called by people who actually use. Never contemplated it, never was even remotely tempted. 30%-50% of the people I have called friends from the lifting community have used, are using, or are in-between cycles.
After he scored a shitload of goals last year.
No I didn't
If someone were to create a super athletics league where guys were doing 7 second 100m sprints and jumping 20m high jump ropes n shit all doped up, i'd watch the shit out of that - and I think i'm not alone!  Hold it in some island nation who wants the revenue and do internet pay per view, could be worth billions!
The Russian Mafia boss has spoken.
This is the president that plays on a hockey team with all pros agents a team of amateurs
Putin? Honesty?

HAHAHA
Is that because their new head of sports in Russia is named Barry Bondsov?
Someone please link the documentary about Putin, please.
 Just open a doping contest, and a separate one for non-dopers. Once anyone enters the doping contest, they aren't allowed back in the non-doping leagues. Problem solved!
"...and in international news today, five time Russian heavyweight boxing champion Dimitri Valvyatev has been removed from the Russian National Boxing League amidst the revelation that for some time now he has been using performance enhancing bears. Investigations are twofold, focusing on discovering the time and circumstances under which the bears were first used, and how the hell no-one realized that there was a 2000 kg brown bear in the ring during any of Valvyatev's fights during the last few years. We'll have more on this story as it develops. For now, this is Dick Micky, BBC News, reporting from the Russian capitol of Moscow."
Just like elections right vladdy boy?
Unlike war.
Coming from the guy who has a New England Patriots super bowl ring, that quote has a new meaning.
Bet Fedor doesn't get tested.
Someone just watched Rocky IV.
I think we should have a separate event for each of the sports just like the special olympics where doping is a requirement. Keeps it out of the real events (yeah right) and these idiots can drug all they want. (and die shortly after the shows over)
He said while staying at a picture of Alex Rodriguez.
Thought the photo was of Skrillex when glancing at the thumbnail.. 
well, credit where credit is due.
I approve of this stance.
This is a lesson Marc Marquez, MotoGP and DORNA need to learn.

That's dope. 
A Russian talking about honesty ?  Sure..............................
"Russia isn't invading Crimea."  
"We are only attacking ISIS targets."
Honest sporting contests...just like when you play hockey with ex-NHL stars, eh Vlad?

http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/16/vladimir-putin-hockey-goals-nhl
sad. odd timing though tbh all this business going on with the cold war, I mean from what I've experienced in training I'd be surprised if most developed countries didn't have some messed up programs for their top athletes state sponsored or private. cause even in my tiny ass town in the back of bumfuck nowhere nearly 70% of the dudes I know training for sports or just recreation/health have undermined themselves with shit like unnecessary testosterone and hormones
His opinions about sports seem to differ vastly from his opinions on elections 
Either honest about all being clean or all being super doped. Both are acceptable.
Where was this guy when Apollo died? 
I bet Rocky is pissed right now.
Mo'nica Vlad
i wish there were two competitive leagues for sports. One with no doping, and then one with all the doping you want. It'd be crazy to see just how far we can push the boundries of the human body competitibly with the science behind excercise, nutriton, supplements, and drugs.
Whatever your views about Putin, this sends a message.
Good guy Putin 
They've been dopin' since Rocky IV.
"On the other hand, I prefer my political contests not to be too honest, or interesting for that matter."
putin knows honest
I keep reading about this man and I'm still trying to figure out why he's such a bad guy. 
Send Putin to fix the NFL and at the same time take away the tax free status. Why on earth does a successful business like the NFL not pay taxes they ain't hard up for money.
Too bad he doesn't feel that way about politics.
I wish everyone would stop acting like doping is a big deal. It's like the Temperance movement never fucking died.
He is right, we should start a doping Olympics. The best that nature and science can achieve.
LMAO
The battle must be open," he said. "A sporting contest is only interesting when it is *perceived as* honest."

FTFU Vlad

Note how he doesn't talk about the ethics of it, just the entertainment value.
I'd probably watch a sports contest where everything goes. Extreme body modification, cybernetics, doping and DNA modifications and violence during competition !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZFAsa958tw


People get mad about atheletes using drugs until they get caught doing it themselves...
He said as he ordered his Spetnatz to seize Crimea.

Maskirovka is not only considered fair play in Russia, use of it is greatly encouraged, keep that in mind whenever Putin opens his mouth.
What I dont understand and find suspicious...Is why Russia is getting focused on here?
When we ALL KNOW that all Olympic Athletes dope, and must dope, to even have a fighting chance against their competitors (not doping would mean accepting to lose).

Russia seem to be stupid enough to get found out
When a Head of State gets involved in doping, I feel like the word "micromanagement" is not enough.
The dude who scores seven goals against professional hockey players is talking about honest sports, LMAO.
And the investigation about all these murders around him?
I care more about what happened to Boris Berezovsky, Anna Politkovskaya and Paul Khlebnikov.
"A sporting contest is only interesting when it's honest."

But, but what if everyone was cheating, new Quadrennial event...

Introducing THE CHEATING GAMES

"Your winnings sir."  
"Oh, thank you very much."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME)
That's funny, considering that obligatory 100% use of doping was enforced by the FSB, which is basically Putin's personal secret police.
The report by the World Anti Doping Agency was written by Dick Pound. That dude has the most awesome name on earth
I'm sure that the investigation will be completely independent, fair and impartial. /s
Canadian speed walker I grew up with won bronze in the university games where two winning Russian walkers have been suspended for doping. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Dunfee

Look at all the people who still believe to this person.
In Russia Putin said exactly this: This is a common problem for all countries (means - It's not us it's you also!) and we must solve the problem. 
We all know China and Russia have been doping for the last 40 years.  There are ways to mask any piss test, it's really a joke.   A 17 year old girl is not supposed to be able to dead lift 690lbs.   
Translation: we don't wanna lose out on the Olympics so we'll have a mock investigation and dig up a few scapegoats who aren't in my cabinet.
&gt; Putin

&gt; Open

&gt; Honest

The only times those three words end up together is when Putin himself says them.
This is a NO WIN situation... I think.

It's a situation where we have to deal with the lesser evil.  

If you make it illegal, you're just creating a situation where people will cheat because they can win.  You won't stop it.. That's clear.

If you make classes where you can do some drugs, people will STILL cheat because now you can get drugs at higher levels which aren't allowed in your class.

I think the BEST situation here is to fully legalize. Let anyone do whatever drug they want to use.

At LEAST in this situation the drugs are safe!  I was reading a recent report where they purchase illegal testosterone and other related drugs like HGH and 30% of them were either fake or contaminated with things like heavy metals.

Funny how this mirrors the situation with illegal drugs ... especially considering we're dealing with illegal drugs.
It turns out the steroids were just on vacation inside the athletes and were not sent there by Putin.
Possible that he didn't know about it. After the 2010 Olympics, Medvedev demanded the sports minister resign, so I can imagine the pressure to build a winning team.
I wonder if hes going to execute witnesses soon?
I actually wouldn't put it past him for genuinely ordering an investigation, given his passion for Judo and other martial arts.  Too bad so many athletes wind up trying to dope under the radar anyways, since the system is so ripe for corruption in the first place.
People get so hype thinking of the future and all the supplements, human enhancements, etc yet can't wrap their heads around doping. Ridiculous.
typical political bullshit. every sport has dopers....
I disagree. I would find a sporting contest that allowed steroids very interesting. And if you try to tell me you *don't* want to see some enormous meatslab unleashing their roid rage upon another pile of beef purporting to be a human, then you're a liar.
to be honest, i love what Putin is doing on a lot of things,  sure i dont like the anit-gay agenda, but so many things are fucking awesome...   not all of it... but at least the guy is taking a stand... 

Because putin had no idea that a well known national doping scandal was happening.
Putin is so full of shit though. It is well known corruption in all aspects of life (especially business) is so pervasive that it is expected and it doesn't matter if it is done blatantly.

Businesses have special manuals on how to deal with business in Russia because of this. So where you might have a manual on cultural expectations when doing business in the middle east, when talking about Russia it will straight up say, you may be expected to bribe officials etc.

Russia is very much like the kid that ate the chocolate cookies and refuses to admit it even though its face is covered in chocolate and crumbs.
A dishonest sporting contest could probably be more interesting
hhahahahahaha
Oh come on, everyone knows Russians dope. I watched a little know documentary back in the day about a philly boxer. He had a Russian opponent who was basically openly doping. I think he name was Ivan something. I can't remember the  documentary, or I'd post a link.
Good guy Putin
If he wasn't so homophobic, I'd suggest this guy is the top world leader at the moment. Guys always telling it straight. As for the Syrian involvement, legend. 

Edit: Downvoted. I sometimes forget reddit is America with it's brainwashing media, sorry guys, but he is speaking the truth. All you guys know is CNN and Fox news (which from a distance is like a comedy / spoof show).
&gt; "A sporting contest is only interesting when it is honest."


Futebol! - NO DRUGS HERE EVER.
As opposed to politics...
Personally I think these sports contests like the Olympics are interesting because it shows the pinnacle of human ability.  If somebody has pushed the envelope even further with chemicals to me that makes it even more interesting. 
Stop testing, let athletes be medically supervised while doping to the gills, don't tell the public = awesome sports
Idk baseball would be crazy if everyone hit like McGwire in 1998
Seems pretty fair when all the athletes are doping.
Why not make a separate Olympia where doping is allowed? Imagine the scientific advances in biotechnology and biochemistry that could be made when doping is tolerated...
As opposed to war. And Dick Cheney agrees!
I dont think people understand that sports like Olympic weightlifting would cease to exist in any kind of entertaining form without the use of anabolic steroids. If Russia and other countries completely went clean sports like olympic weightlifting would be mere shadows of what they are today.
Here's the thing...  If other athletes are not being beaten by the ones who are on getting caught on PEDS, do you really believe the ones beating those people are clean?...
Sports are corrupted because of the money. I never romanced over the ethos of professional sportsmanship.
Sports actually just get interesting if the athlete is doped.
They really need to allow all steroids across the board. Only the good cheaters get away with it, and everyone does them. 
&gt;If we could not do anything to take doping out of sports, then doping was **meant to be** in sports.  

Dr. Wade Exum - US Olympic Commitee director for drug control, 1991-2000
I heard of a guy in the US who put his 12 year old on a steroid cycle so he'd grow bigger, faster, stronger.  It worked - kid made it to be a professional hockey player.  The father came up with the idea after his eldest was never selected into professional hockey because "he wasn't big enough."
&gt; sporting contest is only interesting if it is honest.

I feel this is not true.  Witness all the media attention this topic is getting.  If it is not interesting, why the headlines?
Hopefully one day, PEDs will just be legal.
I respect this. And if it's just talk, I still respect it a little. 
What happen to this guy.... Yesterday he was an asshole, today he's a pretty alright dude...
Maybe I have to let you in on something Vladimir as someone a quarter your age. Not everything is a battle buddy. The world would be a nicer place if more world leaders learned this.
One thing old Vlad can actually be trusted with is sports. Huge Judo and Sambo fan as well as a huge hockey fan. He's a shit bag most of the time, but the man loves his sports. 
'It turns out the Ukrainians were responsible, so we invaded their country to set things right'                                                                      
If it wasn't for Putin's mouth-foaming hatred of gays, I'd really like him.
"The authors report, Dick Pound..." C'mon you guys. C'mon. 
I didn't know Russia was part of MLB. 
Stupid decision.  
  
Basically other countries get scot free with their drugged up elite athletes, why shoot yourself in the foot?  

Who gives a shit? Everything about sports is already kinda foolish. Nobody's life is affected by an athlete doping or not.

To believe the US aren't the biggest dopers is the biggest joke. they just have the biggest sway in commercial circles to bypass or officially hide processes.

Former WADA directors/anti doping directors in the Olympics have come out and testified this.
I actually think he's sincere about this. He's a "mans man" as he likes to see himself and relishes physical challenge.
good guy Putin 
Call me naïve, but I'm more trusting of Putin on this one compared to other issues. He himself is an athlete, and moreover a martial artist. If he has personal pride in his accomplishments, the use of drugs by other athletes should rightfully piss him off. I imagine he actually cares about honor in sporting competitions.
Well he's a Judoka so he'd know.
This Putin guy is ticking all the right boxes.
Just allow drugs, would be a lot more interesting.
I heard that a lot of European soccer players are sinners. 
Is this propaganda pushed forward due to the current world issues with Russia?
Some actual information about tuna fishing, and why the dolphin-safe label might do more harm than good: 
http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=6539

&gt; It can be difficult for people who have never seen it in action to appreciate the scale of modern commercial fisheries. Commercial fishermen aren’t out on the high seas with handheld rods and reels catching one fish at a time. The nets that tuna fishermen use, which are called purse seines, are miles long. With a net that size, it’s pretty much impossible to catch only tuna. Those nets also catch anything that happens to be swimming near the tuna. These unfortunate animals, killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time, are called bycatch.

&gt; There are three ways that tuna schools can be located. The first is to search for them directly using surface ships and small aircraft, which is inefficient, time-consuming, and not always effective (you can’t see tuna from the surface if they’re deep enough or if weather conditions aren’t ideal). The second is to attract tuna using floating objects, which we’ll discuss in more detail shortly. The third is to follow dolphins- for unknown reasons, dolphins in the Eastern Tropical Pacific are often found associated with schools of large tuna.

&gt; Because finding dolphin-associated schools of tuna was extremely easy (unlike tuna, dolphins have to return to the surface where they are easy to  spot), it was the preferred method for decades. The Eastern Tropical Pacific Tuna Fishery had a high rate of dolphin bycatch. According to NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Service Center, an estimated six million dolphins were killed during the forty or so years that purse seining around dolphin-associated tuna schools took place. That’s approximately 150,000 dolphins per year, which is by far the largest cetacean bycatch of any fishery in history. However, it is important to note that mortality from being tuna bycatch did not mean that dolphins were endangered. The two primary species involved are spinner dolphins (data deficient) and spotted dolphins (least concern).

&gt; A massive PR campaign led by the Earth Island Institute resulted in making it illegal to sell tuna caught from dolphin-associated schools in the United States. Dolphin-safe tuna was born.

&gt; Now that fishermen could no longer use what was previously the most common method for catching tuna, they needed to change strategies. They turned to using floating objects (sometimes called FAD’s or fish aggregating devices) to attract tuna to a known location. One of the strangest known behaviors exhibited by open-ocean animals is their tendency to aggregate around any solid object that floats. This might have something to do with the fact that many open-ocean animals go their entire lives without seeing any sort of hard surface. This method is extremely effective for aggregating tuna, but it also aggregates many other species. Setting a purse seine around a dolphin-associated tuna school results in catching primarily large adult tuna (the target size because they have more meat per unit effort and because they have reproduced already) and dolphins (which are not endangered) . Setting a purse seine around a floating object results in all sorts of bycatch, including endangered sea turtles, open ocean shark species which are already in serious trouble, and high numbers of small tuna (which have not yet reproduced).

&gt; A simple glance at the table above shows that while dolphins bycatch goes down, every other studied species (except “unidentified bony fishes”, “other sailfishes”, and marlins) has much higher bycatch rates in “floating object” tuna fishing than in “dolphin associated” tuna fishing. In other words, while better for dolphins, “dolphin-safe” tuna is disastrous for almost everything else.

&gt; If you do the math on this (and you don’t have to because the Environmental Justice Foundation already did), you find that one saved dolphin costs 25,824 small tuna, 382 mahi-mahi, 188 wahoo, 82 yellowtail and other large fish, 27 sharks and rays, 1 billfish, 1,193 triggerfish and other small fish, and 0.06 sea turtles.

&gt; Last summer, I went on NPR’s “The Pat Morrison Show” to discuss this issue with a representative from the Earth Island Institute, the organization most responsible for dolphin-safe tuna policies. I had expected him to acknowledge that the bycatch was a problem, but that it was still important to protect dolphins because they’re intelligent mammals (or something like that). Instead, he argued that there was no bycatch of endangered species taking place under dolphin safe tuna policies, and he accused me of perpetuating the propaganda of evil fishermen who “just want to kill dolphins”. Yikes.

&gt; A conscious choice to go back to a previously-banned fishing method that kills large numbers of charismatic animals puts a bad taste in my mouth, but the fact is that fishing for dolphin-associated schools of tuna catches primarily non-endangered dolphins and adult tuna. Dolphin-safe tuna fishing is killing dozens of species, many of whom are endangered, and threatening the integrity of entire ecosystems.

edit: I'm not arguing for changing our tuna-catching methods back, just trying to give a clearer picture of what large-scale tuna fishing actually *means*, dolphin safe or not.
This has very little, if anything, to do with TPP. Mexico [first lodged the complaint in 2008](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds381_e.htm), saying that the labeling was an unfair barrier to national trade. And under the WTO, they've been right. 4 times, now, after each appeal by the U.S. Not really sure what connection this has to the TPP, since all that happened is that on November 20th, the WTO released [a crazy long summary of their panel decision](https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/FE_Search/FE_S_S006.aspx?Query=\(@Symbol=%20wt/ds381/ab/rw*%20not%20rw2*\)&amp;Language=ENGLISH&amp;Context=FomerScriptedSearch&amp;languageUIChanged=true#), ending with:

&gt; The Appellate Body concludes that the United States has not brought its dolphin-safe labelling regime for tuna products into conformity with the recommendations and rulings of the DSB [Dispute Settlement Board]

Again, this is all under the WTO that already monitors international trade. At best, you can use it as an argument by analogy, if you assume the TPP will be even free trade-ier, that similar restrictions on domestic regulations could be increased under the TPP. But the quote from [the linked article](https://shadowproof.com/2015/11/28/ban-on-tuna-labeled-dolphin-safe-shows-how-tpp-will-crush-consumer-rights/)

&gt; In order to placate Mexico as a member nation of the upcoming (and seemingly inevitable) Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the WTO deemed dolphin-safe labeling a “technical barrier to trade”

that tries to link this decision to the TPP, is totally meaningless.
False alarm guys, the WTO didn't abolish dolphin-free labelling. What they *did* do is rule that the US's requirements for the label were discriminatory, and that they should be changed. To quote part of the case in question:

&gt;With respect to Mexico's claim under Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement, the Panel found that Mexico had demonstrated that the US dolphin-safe labelling provisions are more trade-restrictive than necessary to fulfil the legitimate objectives of (i) ensuring that consumers are not misled or deceived about whether tuna products contain tuna that was caught in a manner that adversely affects dolphins  and (ii) contributing to the protection of dolphins, by ensuring that the US market is not used to encourage fishing fleets to catch tuna in a manner that adversely affects dolphins, taking account of the risks non-fulfilment would create. The Panel's conclusion was based on the following two findings: (i) the findings that the US dolphin-safe labelling provisions only partly address the legitimate objectives pursued by the United States and (ii) the finding that Mexico had provided the panel with a less trade restrictive alternative capable of achieving the same level of protection of the objective pursued by the US dolphin-safe labelling provisions.

Considering the article emphasised that TPP is somehow responsible, in a way that I can't see whatsoever, I'm inclined to believe they were just trying to make it seem far more scary than it actually is just for the ad revenue.
Extra Extra!!! Website with a name like shadowproof.com crushes any pretense of journalism: bringing up unrelated WTO decision and lying about what it actually said managed to convince over 9000 people TPP is evil. Redditors with more than 2 brain cells will effectively nullify that critical practice.
/r/titlegore
Fuck OP's title and agenda

This has nothing to do with TPP or Consumer Rights
TPP is not WTO
Not the same thing at all, just wanted to chip in. There are responsible ways to catch fish. I've worked as a salmon fisher in Alaska and we use small boats, shorebound nets and are extremely regulated by the hatchery with how many fish we are allowed to catch. It is possible to fish responsibly, but not at the consumption scale the 1st world public is used to.
The US laws seem to be discriminatory; they protect dolphins, but not tuna.

On a more serious note, I assume the US only loses those appeals it wishes to lose. I suspect that the dolphin lobby doesn’t have the clout of AIPAC or the NRA. If it did, the US would have funded the necessary research to scientifically prove its prescribed method for protecting dolphin was superior to that of Mexico. Or it could at least have used information gathered by the NSA to blackmail the tribunal into ruling in its favor.

Reddit, the website where everyone thinks they are above average smart but still upvotes sites named 'Shadowprove.com' to the front page.
What a bunch of bullshit lies!  First, this was not TPP, this was WTO.  Second, the ruling under WTO was RIGHT!

The Mexicans RIGHTLY complained.  The US was using dolphin-safe as a COVER to protect US tuna fishermen.  The Mexicans have no problems with dolphin-safe fishing, and in fact, they export to other areas that require dolphin safe tuna, such as jurisdiction in the EU.

Look at the actual ruling instead of this bullshit red herring story:

https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds381_e.htm

"In particular, the Appellate Body examined whether the different conditions for access to a “dolphin-safe” label are “calibrated” to the risks to dolphins arising from different fishing methods in different areas of the ocean, as the United States had claimed.  The Appellate Body noted the Panel's finding that the fishing technique of setting on dolphins is particularly harmful to dolphins and that this fishing method has the capacity of resulting in observed and unobserved adverse effects on dolphins.  At the same time, the Panel was not persuaded that the risks to dolphins from other fishing techniques are insignificant and do not under some circumstances rise to the same level as the risks from setting on dolphins.  The Appellate Body further noted  the Panel's finding that, while the US measure fully addresses the adverse effects on dolphins resulting (including observed and unobserved effects) from setting on dolphins in the ETP, it does not address mortality arising from fishing methods other than setting on dolphins in other areas of the ocean.  In these circumstances, the Appellate Body found that the measure at issue is not even-handed in the manner in which it addresses the risks to dolphins arising from different fishing techniques in different areas of the ocean."
Somewhere in one of Earth's massive oceans is a tuna flopping around on deck wondering "Hey! What about me!"
This ruling has nothing to do with TPP. It is a separate WTO ruling. Headline and linked article's reference to TPP is misleading and dishonestly inflammatory.
Completely aside from the while dolphin-tuna debate...

"Consumer rights"

Ha! We have the right to consume whatever schlock they put in front of us, and pay them for it. As consumers, they dont see us as having rights, they see us as having wallets.
Everyone seems to know everything about everything on Reddit. I read the comments and people are bickering about the technicalities of tuna fishing whilst I'm trying to wrap the idea around my head that people have given this a moment of thought their entire lives before this thread. 
Who upvotes this shite?
**Well, here's what really happened...**

http://www.ictsd.org/bridges-news/bridges/news/wto-appellate-body-revised-us-tuna-labelling-regime-violates-trade-rules

The US had implemented an anti-competitive measure to tuna fishing industry under the guise of dolphin protection, which unfairly obstructed Mexico's ability to fish for tuna but didn't really protect any dolphins. The WTO rightly issued a ruling against the US.

This really has **nothing** to do with the TPP. The case predates the TPP.  This is really an example of the WTO correcting anti-competitive measures that the US government had made to favor US businesses. 

The WTO is making sure that everyone plays fair, including the US.  The TPP rules would reinforce the WTOs rulings.
Sorry but no...
Although Dolphin Safe tuna is better for marine mammals in the short run it decimates the food chain through extensive bycatch.  Assuming that your tuna is "environmentally friendly" because it's dolphin safe is very wrong. 
The entire argument here is based on a ruling that has already been given multiple times by the WTO prior to the existence of the TPP. This article is a shit piece of journalism that is assigning false blame. You want to be upset about TPP? Fine. Go ahead. That's reasonable. But you're too late to do anything about it. No one seemed to care when Mexico was bitching about this the first 4 times...
There should be a ban on tuna fishing.
It is very simple on how to overcome the effects of big industry. Buy LOCAL! They have all of the power because of convenience. It's convenient to let someone make buying decisions about the origin and quality of what you eat. Organic or not - buying from purveyors directly gives us the control of the most basic economic principal: supply and demand. Whales are farmed as a part of the tuna trade because people make uneducated food decisions because it is easy (for example) to go buy a 99 cent can of tuna from wal-mart without a care about what is in the can or how it was farmed. As a people, we need to slow down. So tired of people complaining about such principals and still letting convenience effect supply and demand. 

Tl;dr: We're fucked.
-Dolphin-safe tuna. Great if you're a dolphin, but what if you're a fuckin' tuna? (Drew Carey)

Hey /u/maxwellhill,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Louis CK has a [great bit about "dolphin-safe" tuna](https://youtu.be/V7-bCzrDh8Y?t=4m51s).
Fuukkkk yuuuu dorfin! Fuukkk yuuuu wairreee. 
The problem is the shrimp-kabob Jihad.  
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/V7-bCzrDh8Y?t=289) old Louis CK bit about dolphin safe tuna. 
What good have governments ever done when they met in secret and kept their people in the dark?
So now we'll have tuna and dolphin to eat? I don't really see the problem.
Yes, but is the tuna human-safe, considering the new water out there?
What? Giving unaccountable government bureaucrats more power over us turned out to have a negative effect? Who would have thought!
Meanwhile in Syria... 
But Wild Alaskan Salmon (canned, fillets, etc). You literally cannot go wrong. It is sustainable, environmentally friendly, and you will be supporting small business owners. 
What, if anything, can we reasonably do to help decrease by-catch mortality of any species including dolphins? It sucks for the tuna, but those we actually eat and put them to use. The dolphins dying are just unnecessary deaths, regardless of whether they're endangered or not. There has to be some better methods; maybe not as cost/time efficient as the current ones, but if they result in less by-catch mortality I'm all for it.
http://hyperioncantos.wikia.com/wiki/Maui-Covenant

So sad.. I just read this chapter in hyperion. This planets story is how the building of a portal to connect this world will cause massive changes in the ecology , economy , culture, etc of everything on the planet.  In their years since separating from humanity they had developed technology of sustainable islands, communication with marine life, sea faring based life styles.. the connection to the hegemony links them to the universe populated by capitalism (and some underlying secularism). This turns the planet into basically the Miami or Punta caña of the universe. Obviously great fortunes are made but the original couple 100 thousand or so founders of the planet instantly lose the lifestyle they'd forged. 

This book is damn good. Forgive typos, phone 
I believe that we as consumers should be educating ourselves much better about the products we buy. ESPECIALLY what we put in our bodies. After all, you are what you eat! We shouldn't be relying on corporations because they eff up, a lot. 
Dolphin safe or not tuna is endangered. You all should stop eating it antway. 
Must not be so critical if they nullified it. We're all just a bunch of idiots for thinking this is such a big deal when surely our overlords know what's best for us!
Against TPP... But we should ask ourselves, who wants it...
This is fucking pathetic. 


Responsible brands should just write 'less harmful to Dolphins'... 
Banning such labeling is unconstitutional on its face, and treaties don't trump the constitution.
Embrace the chaos that's coming!  WW3 is on its way folks.  
TPP feels like one giant ass fucking.

The tuna just doesn't taste the same without the dolphin
People who care could just buy less seafood.  Are we not raping the fuck out of the oceans already?
This  is a good example of how TPP will be a race to the bottom, and not a raising of international standards and norms. 
What about this statement, as taken from the WTO dispute settlement?

"[the panel's decision that Mexico had demonstrated the labelling provisions were restricting trade was based on] (ii) the finding that Mexico had provided the panel with a less trade restrictive alternative capable of achieving the same level of protection of the objective pursued by the US dolphin-safe labelling provisions."
Japan..
It's actually worse than that: the TPP actually lowers tariffs on dolphin and wale meat.  [It's going to facilitate more than just accidental killing of dolphin/whales](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObservingCetacea/comments/3rp006/tpp_australia_01061200_tariffs_on_live_animals/)
For the curious, there's a documentary called [Tuna Wranglers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIbGTwLGZNU) where they give you a sense of just how massive the operations are.

The fish don't stand a chance. I'm honestly surprised there are any left at this point. I love tuna but I don't buy it because of how awful the commercial fishing industry is for the environment and for fish populations. A good practice would be to eat smaller and faster growing fish like sardines. They kinda taste like canned tuna anyway. Fewer toxins, more easily replenished, and less by-catch. 
So much waste fish every day. Just seems like their should be a price on waste fish, after all you pulled them from our planet.
Concern for animals?...Stop eating them, simple :)
It's capitalism, people. Profit is God, and to hell with whoever or whatever dies on the way there. 

No, I mean that literally, the incentives are such that people will do anything including kill to get their hands on some freedom. And money equals freedom in a capitalism.
"Dolphin-safe" labeling has one huge restriction: you are not permitted to "set on dolphins" (the practice of intentionally trapping dolphins in a net, since they are often in close proximity to tuna). This is the primary restriction that massively decreased dolphin mortality. 

The GTO panel considers this ban "discriminatory", because Mexico makes heavy use of setting on dolphins: 

&gt; [The measure denied access to the “dolphin-safe” label to tuna caught by setting on dolphins, Mexico's primary fishing method](https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds381_e.htm) 

The GTO justified this by pointing out that dolphins may be harmed by other, approved fishing methods, and these risks haven't been quantified. (So, *not* intentionally trapping dolphins might be just as dangerous as intentionally trapping them. Despite the fact that, you know, dolphin mortality has been hugely decreased by stopping this one practice). 

One panelist disagreed, finding that this restriction "was justified on the basis that setting on dolphins consistently involves a higher degree of risks to dolphins than other fishing methods." But even this dissenter found that stricter certification standards were discriminatory. 

The Mexican fishing fleet mostly fishes in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) large purse seine fishery. Because of the heavy use of "setting on dolphins" in this area, the dolphin-safe certification has additional requirements for tuna caught there - both the captain *and an independent observer* must certify that the tuna were caught without setting on dolphins. 

The GTO found *this* discriminatory - even if intentionally catching dolphins could be banned, you can't impose stricter monitoring on an area just because the banned behavior is standard practice there (as the GTO itself acknowledges). 

By this logic, if a country is known to use child labor, it would be discriminatory to require additional proof that no child labor were used, unless these same measures were in place *everywhere*. And it would be unreasonable to ban child labor in unsafe working conditions without proving that children *not* laboring in unsafe working conditions were any safer. 

This dolphin-safe case should serve as a great example of what we can look forward to under TPP. TPP will be even worse - they'll be able to order countries to pay foreign investors for lost profits when a state passes a discriminatory regulation. And TPP's dispute resolution process is much murkier than the WTO's. 








The Phantom Pain hasn't crushed any consumer rights its just a game calm down
After a little skimming I see that on one hand the TPP has government official websites telling us that its a good thing for the people, and the people are telling us its a good thing for profit margins.
 
What the fuck is our future going to look like? We're so concerned about how much fresh water is left and the amount of food we're consuming yet we're going to turn up production?? 
 
Well, I'm glad I'll be dead before I see everything run out. What can we do to stop people who are showing us they are unstoppable? That they have the government on their side.. We're fucked.
Any legislative bill over ten pages is suspect and very bill over 50 pages should be banned by common law sensibility.  

And in the matters of "case law" and "regulatory" law, only the most distilled and carefully reviewed by public, authorities in the field, and honest legal scholars of proven scholarship (rare in our time) should be accepted. 
 
Can we please just move on to outright class warfare and major business figure assassinations in public? My body is ready. 
Thanks, Obama. 

Good to know you had the entire world in your thoughts while hiding the bill from us all the while.
 "I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species and I realized that you're not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but you humans do not. You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You're a plague and we are the cure."
Screw SOPA,PIPA,TPP,TTIP etc. etc. before they will screw us.
It's sources like this that are what make r/news and r/worldnews such a joke.  I really wish the news subs actually had some rules around dubious sources and misleading click-bait headlines. 


Don't eat tuna. 
This ruling has nothing to do with TPP. It is a separate WTO ruling. Headline and linked article's reference to TPP is misleading and dishonestly inflammatory.
TPP makes it seem like we just gave up trying to regulate anything corporate related. Let's just fuck up our world and our freedom in the name of short-term profit. 
How much of a classic Bond-villain vibe are they going for here? EVERYBODY loves Dolphins! Who the fuck out there is so hellbent on killing Dolphins that they're against *Dolphin safe tuna* wtf
WTO and the United Nations should be terminated.
International trade law student here. 

Let me first elaborate the basic facts: 

1. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) is established under the Marrakesh Agreement 1995. 

2. The Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPP) is a separate Agreement between selected member countries. The text of the Agreement has been approved, but it is yet to be ratified.

3. The rules and procedures of the WTO have nothing to do with the TPP. These two agreements are distinct and independent.

To move more specifically to the dispute

4. This dispute between Mexico and USA dates back to 2008. The WTO's panel report gave its judgement in September 2011 and the WTO's Appellate Body (AB) gave its report in May 2012. A summary of the dispute can be found at &lt;https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/cases_e/ds381_e.htm&gt; (as linked by the author). In 2012, TPP was on a distant horizon.

5. As per the WTO's Dispute Settlement Procedure, there is a mechanism to ensure compliance. This mechanism is given in Art. 21.5 of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Agreement whereby a compliance report is issued. 

6. The Compliance Report in respect of the Panel Report was in April 2015 and in respect of the AB Report was in November 2015 

Now elaborating a bit further on WTO's Dispute Settlement Procedure:

7. The WTO, or more specifically the Panels and the AB, in giving their decisions, do not look at other Regional Agreements, especially those agreements which are yet to come into force. Neither does the WTO look to placate members while giving judgments. WTO gives its judgments on the basis of the facts and law. Subsequently, the report is adopted by the WTO. 

8. The WTO did not give its decision now. The dispute was decided by the AB in 2012. The WTO has now published the compliance report. 

To end: 

9. To state that the WTO has somehow "placated" Mexico by holding the requirement of "dolphin free" to be contrary to WTO rules is incorrect. I have not read the report, but a quick search of the report does not reveal any mention of TPP. A short summary of the case can be found on the link in point 4 above.  

10. I'll add here that the there are measures which prima facie seem to be a measure for protecting environment, but are disguised restrictions on trade. If anyone's interested, they could also look up the US - Shrimp (DS 58 AB Report). This had similar facts.
Why does Obama hate Dolphins? He's going to sign the TTP, isn't he?
My problem with the TPP and other free trade pacts is that there's no involvement of the general public when it comes to the terms and even knowledge of what the agreements entail. I think integration with other countries in general is a good thing and I actually support the concept of a loosely federated global government, but these kind of agreements disempower people by making them beholden to market forces and multinational corporations. It's a threat to sovereignty and democracy.
Is there anything good about TPP for consumer? 
What the fuck is the US getting in all this BS? It seems everyone else gets great deals but USA gets fucked.
So the top comment is a fair point about dolphin-safe tuna might not actually be a good thing.  That's cool, I always like learning about perverse incentives and things that seem obviously good but in fact aren't.  Thanks.  Perhaps I'll write to my representatives in Congress or try to raise awareness on the Interwebs. 

Oh wait, that's the democratic process in action, and apparently the WTO and free trade agreements can override that.  So...do I write my local CEO a letter?  Urge Mexicans to appeal to their own political leaders? 

What I'm saying is that the decision overturns US law via a completely undemocratic process.  Even if the end result is good for the environment, that's pretty fucked up. 
STOP ACTING LINE TPP HAS PASSED IN THE US. TELL YOUR REPS TO VOTE NO. 

Sorry for caps, but I'm not seeing this said anywhere. Everyone from the start has acted like TPP is already on the books. It isn't. Phone your congressmen and tell them vote no on TPP or DIE!* 



*politically
Can we lift the ban on killing people ruining the earth? I'm sure the amount of good programs being cut will drop to 0
I'm not down with TPP.
This just in pro producer trade organization is anti consumer rights. Story at 11. 
TPP letting Corporations get away with murder. We have oil companies knowingly destroy the planet since they found out about global warming in the 70s and nobody is ever going to pay for that. You can only imagine the good things in store for us with the TPP cause ya know this is all about protecting people lol....
"Shadowproof.com" seems like a reliable, unbiased source 
Can we overthrow our governments now?
We have a right to, all of you know that right?
Why do people care about dolphins but not tuna?
Just a suggestion, but why don't we change our food culture to not associate tuna as a cheap staple. We need to increase tuna prices so we can pay fishermen more to avoid dolphin associated schools and adjust their catch methods. Its not hard to lower the dolphin death rate, whats difficult is get people to pay more than a dollar or two a can. 
How about reading something about this from another perspective? http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2015/04/29/dolphin-safe-labels-on-canned-tuna-are-a-fraud/

What the hell is a "tuna labelled dolphin-safe"?
Look, "non human persons by India" a place where castes are still acceptable. 
"this tuna doesn't murder dolphins" 
♫ Dolphin meat from *Mexico!*♫
Fuck dolphins, and fuck OP.
Don't buy tuna.
What about the TUNAAAA!?
I'm all for the let's just ban tuna killing as well.
Not okay.
Tuna is toxic with mercury and other poisons.  
I was staring at the headline, trying to process what Tuna shows might be and why they were labelled dolphin-safe.
I think initial articles always blow things out of proportion.
That's ok there won't be any tuna left to fish at the rate they are harvesting them anyway.
[Dolphin-Safe Tuna.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQR4-cl9ODc)
I'll just stop buying tuna.   
How do I do something to stop this? Who do I contact?
Wait I'm sorry I'm still a bit confused. Someone help me out here ! 
Cows and pigs are dolphin safe and more tasty.
Le sigh 
Calling it Obamatrade will get all the conserative wackos up in arms about it.
The government is really shitty at just about everything. If there is a bill or law stating what it is intended to accomplish you can rest assured that it will actually do the opposite.

why dosent obama or democrats catch any flak for this? This is their baby and will end up being democrats and Obama's legacy.
Capitalism, raping the planet and blaming it on the poor.
You know what helps even more? Not eating tuna at all.
This thread is threatening to make me a vegan. Sure, vegan food is unsustainable too (quinoa demand in the US threatens to cause famine in Peru...) but at least we're not choosing between extincting sea turtles or dolphins to get our broccoli.
Everywhere else the captain just has to sign a form when they run out of things that are required by the standards that are good.
WTO should deal with trades only AND SHUT THE FUCK UP WHEN WE TELL THEM MONEY IS A TOOL NOT AN END.
But Obama told me it was good?
so now we are about to get spicy dolphin rolls? ugh. this world is too much. 
Gotta love government!
RAGE!
This is something that I know this sounds selfish, but maybe we need to stop people who are showing us they are unstoppable?
That's a pretty direct free speech issue. I think this'll get overturned if appealed, international treaty or otherwise
In the UK at least so much of it.
My understanding is that the TPP (Toilet Paper Policing) is going to result in an effort to regulate the amount of doo-doo that one can apply to a single piece of paper. IMHO this is an outrage.
DOWN WITH THE TPP, WE NEED TO RIOT ITS THE ONLY "LANGUAGE" THEY WILL LISTEN TO
I personally still think this is why we send 40% of our dungeness crab to China, and we use small boats, shorebound nets and are supposed to release the dolphins.
This is why English needs a sarc mark. On the internet, no one can hear your dry wit.
Got to love how anything even resembling the TPP makes it to the top of r/worldnews. 
This deal keeps getting worse all the time!
Thanks Obama... big money shill
Fuck 'em. Do it anyway.
1 dolphin can replace 100s of tunafish lives 
Fuck you dorphin
One of many reasons I do not eat tuna at all... 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E39WWj_RpBc
The TPP is diguisting.  I mean businesses are actually running the governments at this point.
Could a company name themselves 'Dolphin Safe Tuna' as a way to get around this ban?
/r/titlegore

But why can't I buy tuna-free dolphin? 

Edit: I suppose I could in Japan... 
Excuse my ignorance but how is this related to consumer rights?
Completely aside from the Monterey Bay Aquarium is the US to change its rule to take special care t catch tuna.
"Dolphin safe." Doesn't do the tuna much good, does it?
Why is obama pushing this?
It's pretty easy to simply never eat tuna again.  It's a negative effort action.  You simply just don't.
We really shouldn't be eating tuna either. 
tuna is high in mercury, shouldnt be eating it
Go vegan!
It's almost like the TPP was negotiated with only the interests of business in mind. 
maybe people should stop eating tuna? 
One thing people can do is not support these Commercial fishing companies and not buy their products. If there is not a demand  then they can't sell their product. 
Is this the big conspiracy I was looking for, in the TPP?  Tuna plays possum?
We need *more* consumer information, GMO labeling, etc., not *less*.  This is *beyond* infuriating.  I think it's fair to call this **"tyrannical government"** - *this* is what the 2nd Amendment was written for, *this* is why we should all go buy guns while we still can.  (I do not own a gun, and I never planned to, but I feel like this is forcing me to do so).
ITT depression
We need to stand up to them. Stop cooperating with these demonic corporate powers. 
Unless the TPP is ratified by a 2/3 vote of the United States Senate it is no law in this nation. 

Article II of the Constitution is as clear as a bell on treaties.
A plague upon the Earth
cant wait to eat dolphin for the first time
It's going to happen whether we like it or not 
It's pretty clear there has been some serious lobbying taking place for this.

Once again, money talks
TPP is pure evil❢

Who are the fuckers who want this moronic thing?

[TPP is a threat to free software as well](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/licensing/latest-tpp-leak-shows-systemic-threat-to-software-freedom), which indicates that those who want TPP are pure evil ones.

Just say No❢

We need to get rid of the evil beasts of this society❢

As [I wrote on my timeline on facebook earlier](https://www.facebook.com/roland.orre/posts/1121396087887916?pnref=story), if TPP would get through, then only a global thermonuclear war can save this species.
Everybody just stop eating tuna. Solved!
[Fuck you dolphin!](http://i.imgur.com/rGEDzI1.gif)
politicians sucking a dicks of greedy phycopaths - nothing new under the sun
Well, looks like I won't be getting anymore tuna. That's a shame. Up until now I had been getting it a lot for lunch. 
Dolphin is so delicious 
I really think any sentient beings capable of generating higher thought and therefore deserve protection.
Was anyone actually policing the dolphin safe tuna thing?  I always assumed it was a useless marking label that anyone could put on their can.
We need Bane from batman so bad right now. Pull these clowns out of their offices and lay down justice
They're part of the corporatocracy.
Was that because Mexican fishermen, using the same methods, end up with more than 2 brain cells will effectively nullify that critical practice.
Why does an animal's intelligence have anything to do with TPP or Consumer Rights Everyone seems to work out that way... ocean farming has downsides but not give a care about the fishing industry as a whole.
I feel bad for my kids. What a shitty world they will live in. 
Is this the same TPP as this one  : https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/economy/trade ?
Goddamn we're reverting to the days of Lethal Weapon. Even the fucking Murtaughs said no to tuna that also killed dolphins. 

I'm getting too old for this shit!
is this too late to stop in the US?
It's deeper than that dolphins are a threat to the illuminati.
yoiure acting as if some form of keyboard protesting will do anything against billion dollar enterprises , no, they have more money more resources and more power to do what they will
Interesting that Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians 
How can they say it "confirms" anything when they say more than once in the article that they say it **"it has been claimed"**,  **"It now rests with the Egyptian authorities to officially confirm the cause of the attack."**, **"Russian media claim the black boxes have no useful information on establishing the cause of the disaster."**, **"However, something happened"**

I admit it's likely an explosion occurred but as far as I can tell nothing is confirmed still...
Could they just not swab some pieces of the wreckage and look for explosive residue?? I have an insulin pump and every time I go through TSA at the airport they make me rub my insulin pump on my hands, then they swab my hands with a piece of cloth/cotton and put it in a machine where it can detect explosive residue?

I don't know how realistic it would be for them to do it with wreckage from a plane thoubh
Serious Question: How reliable is LePoint? They are the news outlets that originally reported the story.
I know this won't be a popular opinion, but I think it's ironic that so many people adamant that the US and other western nations not bomb in the Middle East, because it creates terrorists by killing civilians, are suddenly all about Russia going scorched earth on ISIS and their followers

I guess people don't actually care about seeing terrorists and their followers killed, they just want someone else to do the dirty work
This was one thing that Putin feared being sucked into a ground war. What he wanted was a quick show of Russia's military power. Now ISIS is calling him out to bring soldiers to Syria.

If he invades Syria on foot, he puts his political power base at a huge risk of another Afghanistan with almost 1/20 of the resources Soviet Union. Even USA couldn't finish the job with mass resources and technology.

If he doesn't mobilize soldiers and take revenge, it's a blow to the tough guy image built up by Putin. 

Either way, Putin doesn't have much room to make mistakes like in Ukraine. The middle east is quickly proving to a place that can't be conquered by a foreign army.
It's funny watching the jingoistic nonsense coming out of some redditors in response to this. Russia will hunt the terrorists to the end of the Earth! 


Are we so quick to forget our history?
The implications of this are huge. Putin didn't have to go into Syria, and now Russian citizens are dead as a result.

EDIT: I didn't say it would go one way or another. Just the facts. All of the problems that exist in the world are just made up. We could literally wake up tomorrow and embrace nothing but optimism and peace, yet we tend to just take an eye for an eye nowadays.

Oh look American and British intelligence was right. Go figure? Lol
Is the mirror just making things up again? bomb? there has not even been press release. they don't even list a source. 
This was a false flag attack to draw Russia in. Also, jet fuel can't melt steel beams. 
/r/RussiaDenies
If you provoke the Russians, you're gonna have a bad time
[deleted]
Pretty impressive stuff for a JV team . . .
stop upvoting british tabloid JUNK
Hmm -- this all makes el-Sisi's government look incompetent (e.g., countries halting flights to Egypt, US/UK drawing conclusions on the cause of the crash before Egypt can produce anything).

Let's see where that line of thinking takes us.
For some reason I never expected this to be the outcome. What can we expect next?
[deleted]
Anyone got a link that's not Mirror?
If an ISIS affiliated group did indeed bomb this plane...
...I wonder if it was directed from the top of ISIS or if this sub group just thought it would be a great idea. 

They might have had their fun, but now the Russian-Iranian-Syrian-Iraq(ian??) war machine might bring the smack down.  I just feel terrible for the civilians that are going to be stuck in the middle if shit goes down


i hope putin goes fucking up some isis
all hell is about to break loose 
This is not a reliable Newspaper
still remember redditors laughing at Islamic State's claim of downing the Russian plane. Don't underestimate the enemy... 
I'd just like to say "S my D" to all the idiots who were jerking themselves off so hard that they seriously doubted that ISIS managed to put a bomb in a plane leaving Egypt, and tried to blame Russia for the crash.
Prediction.

It being impossible to deny that a bomb destroyed the plane, Putin's response will be, regardless of the evidence, to deny it was ISIS and instead blame whichever groups in Syria he's most intent on bombing and fit best into a narrative of the West being responsible.
What's amazing is Russia, despite the now clearer evidence of a terrorist attack, is still throwing angry barbs at the west for claiming it was, and still has regularly scheduled flights to that part of Egypt while much of the rest of the European airlines have yanked those flights.

Reckless denial?  Knee-jerk reaction to be contrarian with the west? 

Edit: Just read that Russia is now suspending flights....

how crazy would it be if the FSB planted the bomb to further portray Russia as the victim of Islamic extremism and to help legitimize their involvement in Syria? 
This is really bad for the Russian government.
So what does Russia do in response, should it be a terrorist attack? They're already in Syria, bombing the fuck out of everything, but will Russian people want blood? What do they do in that situation?

Am I wrong in thinking this is putting them between a rock and a hard place? We can post that stupid copypasta about them dealing with terrorists til we turn blue in the face, but it is not so simple.
ISIS is fucking scary and even though I disagree with a lot of Russian domestic policy I am grateful they are stepping up to deal with ISIS. I'm an American. I don't care if anyone disagrees with me. I admire their efforts and I am sorry that Russian civilians have been targeted. 
So are Russia and the USA now in this together to destroy ISIS or are we operating independently of each other to destroy ISIS?

I havent been following the issues in the Middle East lately so Im a bit uninformed.

From America, rest in peace to the victims, and good luck to Russia. Do what you need to do.
Putin will now be "Putin" his troops on the ground and "Russian" them into battle 
Id say Isis better get ready for crazy Ivan. He's gonna fuck their shit up Cossack style!
Seems to be a bunch of down planes recently.
The Russians can fight ISIS, which is fine with me.  They are often ruthless in warfare, and ISIS will find that they are not as soft as the USA is. 
[deleted]
I'm not saying it wasn't a bomb because it probably was.  But it's no coincidence that this report is from a French newspaper.  Airbus is a French and European corporation with billions of dollars in sales at stake.  They won't have people thinking their planes aren't safe.
Putin's 9/11.
I hope they go after the money people far more aggressively then the US did.
&gt; "However, something happened, after which the recording of absolutely all parameters of the airplane systems' work abruptly stopped."

That's happened many times before when its been pilot / co-pilot suicide. They throw the cockpit voice and data recorder breakers before yolo'ing it at the ground. Hard to see how a crew inside job would be required for a bomb though.
[deleted]
If it was a bomb who planted it? Time for a lot of theories ans accusations. Who had most to gain from this? The loss of life in a tragedy such as this will be ultimately ignored as all sides try to make political gain. Michael Fallon has already rather callously and insensitively started so one wonders if he is on the gain side?
[Deadly mudflow from Brazilian dam breaches smothers village](http://www.allworldposts.com/2015/11/deadly-mudflow-from-brazilian-dam.html)
How does the black box know the difference between a surface to air/air to air missile and a bomb?
If it says that they found everything absolutely normal until 24 minutes and then suddenly boom and FDR failed, it significantly points to "bomb theory" being right. Otherwise there is no way everything would fail just like and missile possibility has to be ruled out since they were at 31,000 ft. The only possibility is "bomb".

I am ruling out the "broke apart" theory which would lead to sudden decompression too because they found the bodies of the airplane close enough for that to happen. Some of the parts were found few kms away but if plane suffered a breakage at 31,000 ft, I believe they would find the parts further apart from each other and also that had to be large chunks.
The question is, what happens now? Balls in your court Putin.
Can anyone explain how an ISIS operative could engineer an explosion in an engine! It's not as if they can sneak up on a plane, open up an engine cowling and plant a bomb in it, is it? Lets not jump to conclusions until the facts are known.
Is there any possibility that the bomb was not put on the plane in Egypt, but at a previous stop? Maybe in Russia? if so, what might be the reason? I'm just hypothesizing and curious.
Doesn't this mean he has a free ticket to retaliate?
Confirms and "it has been claimed"   used in the same sentence.
&gt; However, Russian media claim the black boxes have no useful information on establishing the cause of the disaster.

Yup it was a bomb all right. Even if investigators find physical evidence proving it was a bomb Russia will say no it wasn't.
"*definately* was caused by a bomb"

You're too drunk to journalism, Mirror. Go home.
&gt;But a Kremlin spokesman said that Mr. Putin’s decision did not mean that the crash was caused by a terrorist act.
  
Of course it does, it's just that Putin doesn't want to look like an idiot in the middle of his attempt at a new cold war.
If this is true, i don't think people understand what Russia will do.  The last time Russia had a major terroist attack against it..it was pretty much game over for that area/group involved.
Did anyone actually read the article?

&gt;**The black box audio recording** from the Russian passenger jet which crashed in the Siani desert killing 224 people **confirms the plane was brought down by a bomb, it has been claimed.**

Claimed by who?  The article doesn't say.

&gt;However, Russian media claim the black boxes have no useful information on establishing the cause of the disaster.

&gt;Sources close to the investigation reportedly told Kommersant claim say the flight data recorder "abruptly" stopped working just over 20 minutes from takeoff.

&gt;They claim it didn't vie any clues over the nature of the catastrophe which hit the plane.

OK..

&gt;Just hours after the plane was brought down ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, and this new information makes their claim seem more and more likely.

What new information?  That there is a claim that the black box confirmed an explosion from a completely unnamed source (they could be referring to claims on Reddit for all we know) but is contradicted by other sources?

For those not aware - the Mirror is basically a tabloid.


How do I get out?
Real shame, I wish people were cool to one another. 
This is a terrible story, but to be expected I think :(
Russia will put monkey in each of those asses belonging to ISIS
There are russians everywhere
Who ever wrote that article and also, editor who had it approved for  publishing should be jailed for 20 years with no parole.

What a garbage of innuendo and bullshit.


Jeez i was hazed for saying they should look through all the luggage pics to make sure WHOEVER got the bomb thru doesnt get one through again. my estimation is ISIS
The article confirmed nothing.
I hope Putin rains fire down on those fuckers.  I'm tired of the "strongest military on earth" pussy footing around.  God speed Russian military. 

edit:  To everyone saying that we are hypocritical for opposing the US effort but all for the Russian involvement.  I'm pretty sure we were all for the US going in, taking care of business, then leaving.  No one wants this long, drawn out, political, money making fiasco that it turned out to be.  We still want ISIS eliminated just not how the US is trying to do it. 
Im hoping Putin gets pissed enough to scorch some serious earth , and kill a whole shit load of ISIS motherfuckers. I want him to nuke them. 
And the Russians are STILL lying about the cause. Update * Now they seem to have finally admitted through their media.

This report proves that Egypt and Russia are liars and that they've known this was a bomb for at least a few days, if not the entire time.

EDIT - ANALYSIS of the (changed from voice of a person) black box confirming an explosion occurred. There's a video from the people claiming responsibility of the crash happening in real time.

Russia are liars, Egypt is liars. They should not be taken seriously now or in the future.

Edit - As an American, at what point do the Russian people say enough of their government lying to them? Never? Are they in full denial? I don't get it.

Edit - based on the downvotes it's full on denial. Sorry you can only bury the truth, not delete it on reddit.
How the Bomb brought to the air plane? can we increase the security?
Meanwhile in Crimea:

"Please let it have been ISIS, PLEASE LET IT HAVE BEEN ISIS"
ISIS claimed responsibility for this days ago. It is odd it took so long to verify this.
Following America's example, does this mean Russia has the justification to invade Egypt or some other tangential country?
There is nothing confirmed really. There is no substantive evidence to support the bomb theory. The media is leading the public opinion, guided by political motion against Egypt and Russia. It is so obvious.
We should all wait till the investigation is done to know the truth. It is very important to know the truth of what happened so we learn about it and try to prevent it from happening again. If it was a terrorist attack, then we should take higher security measures. If it was some fault with the plane, we then learn to correct it. But really what UK and USA media are doing right now sucks! They did so much to destabilize the world!  
Ah Islam, the gift that keeps on giving. Every single day.
2014: Russia downs MH17, economic sanctions take effect.

2015: Russian jet downed over Egypt.

2016: After Two years into economic sanctions, and one year into the renewed Russian-middle eastern offensive (remember the one that tore apart the soviet union the first time?), they are unable to threaten Ukraine or secure the Crimea.

2017+: Russia is so ruined from an endless war and sanctions that they withdraw. They are weakened just as they were from the 1st Afghan war,  and withdraw/kicked from G8. Thus giving the ones left in the G7 more power.

I generally hate conspiracy theories but this all seems to real. Will be interesting to see if it plays out this way..

!RemindMe 1 year
Well, shit. Putin might be putin boots on the ground in Syria and Iraq soon.
I could see how a black box would record an explosion or the evidence of an explosion (sound, cabin air pressure data), but how could it tell the difference between a fuel tank explosion (e.g. flight 800) and a bomb?
What if somehow its a Malaysian person that was angry about the shooting down of MH17 and this is somehow revenge? Sorry I am usually never this conspiracy minded.
With any luck this farce will end with both Putin and Assad on their asses. 
man.... I didn't need a "conformation" that this was a terror attack... As soon as i saw that a Russian plain crashed to the earth in Egypt. That was enough for me to say it was planned by terrorist.... Even Isis was praising that this happened. They are not gonna lie about it. 
Nuke Raqqa!!!!!!
Putin has an unfortunate reputation to uphold. This will get messy.
How do you like it done to you, Russia?
If the Russians weren't terrorists before, they are definitely gonna be terrorists now. S/
Fuck isis.
The Islamic State is growing up so fast. :)

Established a caliphate and downed an airliner within two years? Al-Qaeda is jealous.
I can guarantee that Putin is shitting his track pants right now. He knows that Russia is pathetically vulnerable and now the terrorists know it too.
While this may be true, this is the Mirror, so it is slightly less reliable than flipping a coin for your news
Putin needs to wipe the floor with Isis.Those evil religious fuckturds.
TWENTY-FIVE children murdered on that plane.  Murdered. 
The USA, China, and Russia should get together and just carpet bomb the whole region. All of it. Glass everything. I'm calling a Mulligan. 
Here we have yet another story confirming that Islamic imperialism is a threat to the world.  Islamic fundamentalism needs to be eradicated.  It's no different than nazi ideology.
From the article (which no one read, apparently)...

&gt;However, Russian media claim **the black boxes have no useful information on establishing the cause of the disaster.**

&gt;They claim it **didn't vie any clues over the nature of the catastrophe** which hit the plane.

And how you know this article is bullshit speculation...

&gt;Just hours after the plane was brought down ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, and **this new information** makes their claim seem more and more likely.

&gt;**It now rests with the Egyptian authorities** to officially confirm the cause of the attack.

There *is* no new information and it is *not* up to Egyptian authorities to confirm what happened.

Obviously this article is just more of the same western media speculation in order to grab readers' attention, like they *always* do. The reality is that if the plane was brought down by a bomb, it would probably be pretty easy to tell given that all of the wreckage was found in a desert immediately after it came down so there would be no degradation of the evidence. Bombs would leave tell-tale fragmentation patters as well as residue. If they find none of that, then it wasn't a bomb. There's more than one way a plane can blow up in midair.

What's most significant about this whole event is how little attention the planes *previous* accident is getting. About 14 years ago this plane made a bad landing which caused a tailstrike that caused extensive damage to the structure in the rear of the plane. With this accident, we see that the tail section has broken clean off, which is consistent with the previous damage and would indicate (obviously) that the repair job was inadequate or normal wear and tear caused the repairs to fail. When your tail section breaks off, you're going to get some *explosive decompression*, followed by the breakup of the airplane.

There's hoping you Americans will stop complaining about getting fingered by your airport security people. I bet the bomb that brought down this plane was fashioned out of bottled water and nail clippers, which was allowed on the plane by clueless Russian security guys who aren't aware of terrorists' high-tech steam-powered shrapnel bombs.
I got down-voted a few days ago for writing that the evidence strongly suggested this scenario, but I am going to take the high road and avoid saying 'I told you so'.
ISIS is fuuuuucked.
This is a bullshit article

Karma is a bitch. 
Playing devils advocate what is the likelihood that this was staged by the Russians to steer international opinion?
Muslims doing what they do best. This is why no one cares if they are wiped off the face of the Earth.
I had to upvote this.  Not because I believe it should gain popularity, but because it had 2222 upvotes and I'm that guy.  Cheers.
TIL people read The Mirror.
Does someone here thinks that either an american or a russian bombed that plane on purpose so shit hits the fan and both countries have an actual "justification" to send it ground troops?
I hope Putin &amp; the Russian Army now go out and absolutely flatten ISIS
&gt;However, Russian media claim the black boxes have no useful information on establishing the cause of the disaster. Sources close to the investigation reportedly told Kommersant claim say the flight data recorder "abruptly" stopped working just over 20 minutes from takeoff. They claim it didn't vie any clues over the nature of the catastrophe which hit the plane.

Come on. When will you people learn to stop using the Mirror as a source? It's hyped up shit with the sole intent to get page views. Yes, a bomb is a likely scenario. But this article confirms nothing but vague speculation while citing almost zero credible sources. When it's confirmed by Russian transport officials or the airline I'll believe it.
Now I wonder who is to blame...

The terrorists?

The Dutch?

Or Putin?
Unconfirmed
america probably gave the explosives used in the bomb to the terrorists. it has been proven many times that america backs the rebel groups
Come on let's get this Cold War going!
\&gt;Russia is currently bogged down in Ukraine and unable to push any further because poorly trained, poorly equipped, poorly supplied, and poorly supported volunteer battalions have been have been holding on to Mariupol for months

\&gt;RUSSIA IS GONNA! **RUSSIA IS GONNA!** ***RUSSIA IS GONNA!***

This is hilarious. 
Let me guess, Israel/USA shot it down then blamed it on ISIS.

Russia tries to help the world, and immediately is shot down by Israel/USA, what does that say about current events? 

McCain even said we're siding with ISIS now to fight off Russia, isn't that just hilarious, almost like ISIS was a product of Israel/USA all along.
Russian cover up to help justify their campaign in Syria.
Look, nobody in power gives a rats ass who did what. All they are looking for is an excuse to wage war cuz that's how they make money. Get a clue people.
I hope Russia blows the Middle East away.
Doing a mileage run SFO-IAH-KWI-BAH this weekend.

I got the dreaded quad S this morning despite having TSA-Pre and Global Entry. There was a TSA discussion earlier this week but confirmed that the SFO team is awesome (I believe they're not TSA but an outside contractor). It took a bit of my time, and I ended up running to my gate as they boarded my group.

To be honest I was a little jittery and was worried after all these news articles and the recent development. The flight path looks interesting although I don't believe it flies over Sinai even though the plan shows that path.

Wish me safe travels Reddit! I'll be taking pictures of the dog food that United serves me on my second leg of the trip.
They just found the Black Box.  This article is not credible.
Bravo. But who are you blaming this time? Egypt? Turkey? Saudi? Pakistan? Just naming Islamic countries you've not fucked up already. 

As ALWAYS the US needed a distraction to get the heat off them. So shifted the focus to Russia. Two birds with one stone  

I hope Russia actually investigates instead of doing the dirty work for the US.
