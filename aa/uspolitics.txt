This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2015/nov/09/florida-democratic-party/rubio-spent-tax-money-renovate-florida-house-state/) reduced by 86%. (I'm a bot)

&gt; The Times/Herald story the Democrats linked to noted, &amp;quot;When Rubio became speaker, he spent about $400,000 in tax dollars to remodel offices and build a members-only dining room so lawmakers rushing to meetings or in the throes of negotiations would not have to leave the Capitol to eat.&amp;quot; The story was written before renovations were complete.

&gt; In all, Rubio ordered almost $560,000 in renovations, according to records from the Speaker&amp;#039;s Office.

&gt; Former Speaker Daniel Webster spent about $100,000 in 1997 to build a spiral staircase between the Speaker&amp;#039;s Office and the Republican Majority Office.

Politics aside, Hillary's off-site backroom E-mail server as secretary of state was unprofessional at best, criminal at worst. Bernie acted as of it was some kind of hyperbolic right-wing talking point. I think he puts party above propriety. We'll see if he can win with that tack.
This is *another* example why our filthy-corrupt military should go though a full audit just like every other US gov't department.

Yet despite a congressional requirement to do an audit, the DOD -- with the backing of the military industrial complex -- refuses to perform the audit.

As former US president Jimmy Carter bluntly said, we no longer live in a "functioning democracy."

&gt; "In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist." -- President (and former General) Dwight Eisenhower, Jan 17, 1961.
&gt;Carson's campaign on Friday conceded that ~~a central point in his inspirational personal story did not occur as he previously described.~~ he lied.
Stolen Valor !
Sadly, this gives the racist element of the Republican party a big boost. They're going "We told you so"
Imagine that. It would be really nice if everyone was automatically registered to vote as an independent at age 18. If Republicans want voter ID's so badly, they can put together a program that gives everyone in the country a general ID card free of charge. Basically it'll be a driver's license without driving qualifications on it. They don't want that, though. They want to keep the poor and minorities from voting them out of their cushy jobs.
A strategic &amp; craven move from an unpopular term-limited governor.

It'll be interesting to see if his successor can make headway in this area.
