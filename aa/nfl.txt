Can Green Bay please get a QB that I can dislike?
Can someone provide a script of what Rodgers said?

*Deaf*


Good for Rodgers. No patience for that bs. 
Gained a lot of respect for Rodgers here. Is there a video of whatever the fan shouted?

EDIT: Can hear it very clearly here https://streamable.com/vs3f?t=31.1
Well said Rogers. FTP... but respect
&gt;Cheesehead is a nickname referring to a person from Wisconsin,[1] referring to the large volume of production of Wisconsin cheese. It is also the nickname for the fans of the Green Bay Packers NFL football franchise. **The term is also used as an ethnic slur towards the Dutch.[2][3][4]**
[deleted]
Respect him on the field and off the field. There are issues bigger than football. Good on Rodgers to address that.
That boy was raised right. 
In the 2 "Honour Paris" videos I've seen from games today (NE-NYG, DEN-KC) the silence was not totally observed which i found fucking shocking. Before today I have NEVER heard a minutes silence interrupted nevermind a MOMENT whilst on live TV. 

The NE-NYG game had a twat who had to shout out "ISIS Sucks" and the DEN-KC game had people whooping and just yelling out.

Disrespectful fucks. I don't care if you're drunk or whatever, it's not an excuse. People lost their lives and that doesn't go through your head before you start shouting out and making yourself look like a dickhead? 

Obviously I know it's a select few special assholes who did it and it doesn't represent the 99.99% but it's the first time I've ever heard a moment like that ruined by some shameful individuals, made my blood fucking boil. most likely similar disgraces to whoever said what Aaron Rodgers was referring to.


God dammit my brain is programmed to HATE HIM.

*slow claps as my heart and brain simultaneously detonate*
R E S P E C T

Respect
Where's twitter bot when you need it?
And there it is in Seattle.

Come the fuck on.
What did the fan say?
I hope the dude was a huge die hard Packers and Rodgers fan and then Rodgers was like 'fuck that guy'. Like what do you do? Are you still a fan knowing the franchise ~~GOAT~~ QB thinks you're a chucklefuck?

Glad Rodgers said something, he's a pretty cool guy that doesn't afraid of anything.
He once bought me a sandwich and a beer. GG Rodgers is his standard m.o., a class act.
[Here's the video for those who were curious](http://sports.yahoo.com/video/lions-vs-packers-moment-silence-183500693.html)
Can we get a bot for videos on twitter? I can never watch them.
Good on him. Fuck ISIS, but not all Muslims are bad people.
This is why the Association Football generally speaking does "a moment of applause" to celebrate life rather than silence for loss.  Idiots get drowned out.
Just watched his comments. Wow. Rodgers is awesome. Not only saying that the fan was wrong, but then also continuing and saying that their view is probably why we're in that position today?

Rodgers has balls.
I think doing the French national anthem would've been better than the moment of silence. 
Awesome! Respect for Aaron Rodgers üëçüèª.
God, can you imagine how shitty you'd feel if Aaron Rodgers said he was disappointed in you... That being said, fuck that guy.

Alcohol is probably the highest contributor honestly.  Some people I know start tailgating and drinking at 8AM.  Being this happened in Green Bay it's safe to assume they started at age 9 and have been tailgating strong since.
My opinion of him has gone up tremendously
Good on rodgers , no tolerance for that shit
Just heard the same thing at the start of the Sunday night game. Ridiculous. 
Can't believe it happened again in Seattle.
They played a few of these moments of silence on RedZone. Always one or two assholes yelling shit, no matter what game. Smh
Rodgers 2016
Aaron Rodgers is so cool. He's up there with Jon Gruden on my list of NFL dudes I want to drink a lot of beers with.
One of the truly nice people in the league. Hate the team, respect the player. Go Vikes.
I really like that guy. 
I always like Rodgers. Class act
The people who shout during the moment of silence are the same people who use the shoulder to pass a line of cars
Hes a class act no matter if he wins or loses. He sees the big picture, unlike so many other players in this league.
How can you not love this guy?
Fuck it, sexy Rodgers for pres 2016
Bravo Rodgers. I can seriously respect that. 
Good on Rodgers, that fan was a Grade A asshole.
i heard someone yell "have some respect," i didnt realize that was him.


good for him.s.
Good on you Aaron.
So much respect for that A-Rod.
The best we can do is a tweet of a video of a TV? 
Gained a lot of respect for Rodgers just now.
I do not like what he does to my team continually.  That said, that is about the best thing I've heard out of a  football players mouth ever.  Well done Aaron.  Hats off to ya.
Props to Rodgers for this. A lot of guys would have let that slide.
Ugh some of the comments here.
Respect.
Respect and big ups to Aaron Rodgers.
Take that ISIS! Be chastised and forever hold your goat's milk in shame.
Crap I just fell in love with Rodgers.

I hate this..
TIL muslim is a race.
Man..I hate being different. I just want to live my life like everyone else but it really sucks going day to day knowing a large part of the world hates me for something I had no part in. I do respect Rodgers a lot for calling that out.
Good Guy Rodgers. That's great that he spoke out against that.
Win or lose class act I love this guy
Love ARodg.  Always speaks how he feels and is so cool about it.  Plus, his play speaks for itself.  Good on you, 12, for calling that guy out.  
Nicely said football man.
Nothing but respect for Aaron Rodgers. We need more people like him in this world.
Rodgers is awesome. This is why I can proudly say I'm a Packers fan, no matter what crap happens on the field.
...and rightly so. That behavior is seriously disrespectful. During the Cards and Seahawks moment of silnce I heard somebody yell Vikings suck. WTF people?!
Vikes fan here. I love Rodgers now.
Honestly this is the first thing the guy has ever done or said that I genuinely enjoyed. Good for you, Rodgers. Fuck people like that fan.
Seriously, people in my section of NE corner heard it and were like 'wtf' I think it came from somewhere on the NW/W side
That "fan" is basically your everyday crusader on /r/worldnews
Good on you Rodgers.
Rogers gets some points.  
What a guy. Good on him.
I love you Aaron Rodgers.
Please be my new dad.

I love you new daddy.
Aaron Rogers has always been a class act, and his statement here deserves respect well beyond the realm of football. He took it upon himself to speak out, even though it wasn't required of him. 
That's a classy move from Rodgers. ISIS thrives on driving a wedge between the Muslim world and the Western one. When you spread this garbage it helps them out. They'll take that message of hate and go back and say "Look! That's what they think of us and our brothers and sisters!" Be careful and think before blaming Muslims because it's only a minority that joins these extremists groups.
Just run for president already.
Love him even more now
Class act, sir. Not looking forward to having to root against you when we play you in December.
Good guy Aaron Rodgers. Way to be, man. 
Damn you Rodgers!  I'm supposed to dislike you (as a Bears fan), but it's impossible when you take a moment to lay the wood on some idiot.  There will be two days a year I will not route for you, as a Bears fan.
Good on you Aaron. Way too many people hold prejudices against Muslims, and the western world is completely fine with it. It's hugely disappointing. 
I'm disappointed with many secular liberals on this issue. Many seem to rightly criticize extremism from Christianity, but give Islam a pass for whatever reason.  Guess what, even mainstream Islam is pretty damn disgusting on their views on women and gays.


Respect.
Respect level for Aaron Rodgers at an all time high. 
How the fuck can anyone hate Aaron Rodgers? What classy, classy dude he is.
Anyone know whether or not the fan get kicked out of the stadium?
Respect to Rodgers. Well said
Oh my God. The comments on the article. Why did I read them?
Good on him. I know it's easy to attack Islam as a whole, but there are a lot of Muslims dealing with evil like what happened in Paris a lot more often. And honestly, ISIS wants us to start a war against Islam as a whole.
A-Rod for President? He'll edge out Kanye in 2020.
Muslim is not a race. Muslim is not a race. It's actually pretty racist to assume arab looking people must be religious and must be Islamic. 
Wow, I don't like Rodgers, but that was impressive. Respect.
I am truly surprised a fan of the Green Bay Packers said something racially insensitive at Lambeau.
Guys, PLEASE stop turning this thread into /r/news. Haven't we dealt with enough useless vitriol that isn't doing anything to heal and unify?
Rodgers is awesome.  He's a super respectable person.  Not only is he smart and not afraid to speak out against inequality or prejudice,  he's an amazing athlete.  Get him a cape already.  
Good on you Mr. Rodgers! Obviously not a fan and usually get quite annoyed at his typical press conference trolling but this was awesome 
it's for these reasons that moments of silence should be banned at all major sporting events and replaced with moments of applause...
Damn I love hating on Rodgers but classy move brah. *Raises glass*
At the start of the Patriots game I heard someone yell "Tom Brady!" and a whole section cheered. This was also during the moment of silence. Another reason I hate Pats fans. 
Muslims arent a race...
Sanders/Rodgers 2016 

would be a landslide against Trump/Brady 
It's amazing how pleasant it is to wash myself of the batshit, backwards asshattery of r/worldnews with the camaraderie of r/nfl. 
Somebody buy that man a beer
Great response. Some newfound respect for Rodgers. 
smart man.
I have never liked Rodgers but I respect him for standing up for the right thing. Credit where credit is due. 

This country traces its heritage back to a persecuted religious group who couldn't find peace in their homeland. Let's have a little perspective. 
That isn't what /r/news and /r/worldnews thought yesterday.

So many racial slurs in every thread about the attacks.
When are people going to learn it's the extremists and not all Muslims are extremists 
I seriously don't think it's possible for me to have more respect for this guy.
He did go to Berkeley. Very liberal campus, no room for intolerance unlike some colleges across the nation...
Although I despise the Packers as a rival, I have had a great amount of respect for their past two HOF quarterbacks.  Well done Aaron.  I'm sure we will see you in purple someday. üòâ
Is Muslim actually a "race"?. Not legitimizing the slurs,just curious
Rodgers still unhateable, Packer fans remain extremely hateable. Business as usual. 
That's my quarterback!
Well I guess I can't hate A-Rodg unconditionally anymore. RIP my pure unadulterated hate. 
Nice.   Glad to see him call that bullshit out
Little known fact, this comment was made by Aaron shortly after losing his first home game to the Detroit Lions, and the first loss since 1991 in the state of Wisconsin
Good Guy Rogers
Didn't realize how much of a blowhard AR was. Cool
Do we know what was said? Rodgers didn't say anything about a slur or Muslims
I liked the whole "shut up" guy at the end haha
Can someone post a link that isn't through twitter? I'm not making a twitter account just to watch one video, though I would like to see it
Was he actually the one that yells "Have some respect" during the moment of silence, or did he chastise the fans after the game for being ignorant?
Newfound respect for Aaron.
This title is wrong.  Muslims aren't a race, they are a group of people that choose to follow a religion.  
can't be too shocked this happened in the state that elected scott walker a billion times 
Respect.
Okay guys, it was a cool move by Rodgers, but is it necessary to start sucking his dick this hard? Chastising a bigot is a very easy thing to do. Literally any other player in the NFL would have done the same thing if asked about it.

Again, cool move by Rodgers, but all these "OMG he's so much cooler than I thought much much respect" comments are silly
More of r/NFL's bullshit

"We are so much more enlightened, here"

One person being a jackass isn't news.

An NFL player calling a jackass out is even less news.

You people are completely pathetic. Get over yourselves
fuck yeah 
Goddamn you, Rodgers. Stop making me respect you personally rather than just as a player.
I am going to give credit to George W. Bush for one thing. I think he made a very good effort to tamp down anti-Muslim sentiment that is completely unhinged at this point.
Guess Seattle didn't get the memo!

What did the person in GB yell?

well fucking said Aaron, well said
damn.  I've always hated Rodgers and thought he was really fake and annoying but this made me respect him.
Same thing happened before the Seahawks game too. Some douche yelled, "ISIS Sucks!" We know dude. You don't have to tell us. 
Some guy yelled Fuck Isis during the SEA game's moment of silence
:') that's my quarterback 
Rodgers for President 2016.
As much as I love Carson Palmer, it doesn't match the love I have for Aaron Rodgers right now.
The stupid fucking cunt probably posts on reddit, too. I personally saw a lot of people post pure hatred that need their drinks/gene pools bleached.

There are lot of fucking assholes on this website and in RL that like to blame an entire culture for a select few cancerous human being's actions.  Hate breeds hate.
Aaron Rodgers for president
The only thing that gets more heated than Peyton-Brady, Rodgers-Brady comparisons is politics. 
Did we just hear Rodgers audible the whole stadium? 
Dammit, I want to not like him. 
Does anyone know exactly what was yelled?
This difference between the comments on this story on Reddit vs the comments on this story on the ESPN Facebook post is sad
Of course curiosity will get the best of me and want to know what the person said. I am assuming something like "git all those towel heads/sand ns" but ultimately its probably better left unsaid as Rodgers decided to. Granted someone else must have heard it  but I would probably prefer not to have what exactly. Though I was caught off guard as six degrees of separation as the example of how global and connected we are, but that is ultimately nitpicking and I already had respect for him but holy crap I especially do now.
~~stupid~~ sexy Rodgers
can he run for President?
He is so fucking likable.
worst moment of silence ever...
All these top comments are so bad.... Well said and literally on point most people don't even understand how deep it goes!!
Ugh. Why does he have to be so respectable?
Good on him. There is no such thing as Islamic terrorism, because that term implies essentialism. Nobody calls the Klan or Nazis Christian terrorists,. They're just terrorists. 
That Rodgers is a good kid.
Rodgers was just trying to distract people from their loss to the Lions. Either way, his Northern Californian sentiment is a bit different than the folks who live in Green Bay.  
[deleted]
Shame on that fan, really lending credence to the "Why Your Team Sucks" article from the offseason. 
Gotta give respect where it is due.  I'm the last person to ever say anything nice about the putrid fucking wasteland that I have to live next to or their team but that just earned Rodgers some points in my book.
Muslims are not a race.

edit:  apparently true facts get downvoted on reddit now
Poignant.
As usual, Packers as an organization are pure class.  Their fans these days, not so much.  They even booed their own team during the game multiple times.   Ten years ago that would be unheard of.
Probably one of the same folks who were hollering in Lambeau during the moment of silence for Walter Payton. 
Glad to see at least the packer players have class. Too bad their fans lack it so much.  Also, inb4 downvotes. 
But he's such an asshole!
Is he talking about the part where he threw 61 times and only scored twice?
Seriously tho..fuck Islam.
[deleted]
Rodgers said it best here.  He is awesome.  
Bears fan here, respect.
When something horrific like what happened in Paris on Friday gets people pissed off and they're scared. They lash out because they are told to think that way by news outlets that fear monger (not naming any names here but we know who im talking about). When I try to communicate with people that already want to go to war again are automatically conditioned to think that America has to be the world police and fight everyone's wars for them. I remind them that we have been at war in the middle east for 14 years already and they still think "well we're obviously not doing enough! Go bomb them rag heads MURRICKA!" This is Islam's fight not ours, we need to stay out of it. Let the Muslim countries in the region that say they despise ISIS do something about it. Saudi Arabira has the 3rd largest military in the world, yet they sit and do nothing while ISIS brutally rapes and murders innocents (Christians and Muslims alike) and destroy the artifacts at Palmyra. They call us crusaders because we are in their lands. I know this isnt the sub for a wall of text like this but I feel so strongly that this needs to be said or we will be at war in the Middle East for another 14 years due to blind hatred at a largely peaceful people.

edit: i see that ive wasted my brain power with you people
Wisconsin was the one state that reminded me most of the south east, so it doesnt surprise me that they have some vocal bigots. Good on Rodgers for expressing his disappointment in said fan. 
Maybe he should have focused on the game.
So Aaron Rodgers defends Muslims and he's reddits hero.In week 2 he said "I guess God was on our side haha" to mock Christians, also reddits hero.It doesnt take a lot to see the biases around or in the media.
Who cares? It's all just moral self-licensing.

Maybe we should change our twitter icons?
[deleted]
More evidence that Rodgers doesn't have his head in the game.  The takeaway here is to focus on the game, not chastising fans for being politically incorrect, otherwise you'll lose to the Lions.  LOL
LOB!!!

[edit]It appears I'm in the wrong thread. Oops
This is the kind of thing I expected to hear after a win
http://i.imgur.com/JTe8qLT.gif
Finally the ACL team has a QB. 
Some Ravens fans have been asking "can it get any worse?" Yes. And it has. 
FADE THE FLAIRS.  Matt Schaub is starting...
The worst season in Ravens history?
what a disaster of a year for the ravens
[...](http://i.imgur.com/c7URd5J.gif)
Tank like no team has tanked before. Actually try to go back in time and lose the game you just won.
RIP Ravens 2015-2015
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA I'M GOING TO DRINK SO MUCH! OH WAIT I LIVE IN INDIANA AND TODAY IS A SUNDAY, FURTHERING COMPOUNDING MY MISERY!! OH WAIT THAT'S NOT MY MISERY COMPOUNDING, JUST THE FRACTURE IN OUR STARTING RUNNING BACK'S ARM LMAO I WANT TO DIE
Fuck everything 
[Get ready for Schaub](http://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y300/MechDX/surprise.jpg)
[yup](http://imgur.com/W4tcUiJ.png)
Oh my god.
What the hell? He finished the game so I'm super surprised.
Looks like Forsett should be done too with that broken arm... 
What the fuck did we do to piss off the football gods? 

This is our IR right now: Flacco (QB1), Forsett (RB1), Taliaferro (RB2), Steve Smith (WR1), Perriman (WR2), Campanaro (WR5), Waller (WR6), Pitta (TE1), Zuttah (C1), Suggs (OLB1), Davis (CB4), Elam (SS2)
And thus ends the debate of the most injured team. Ravens, I solemnly pass the trophy on to you. Sorry guys :(
is there really anything left to say about this season?
here you go Ravens fans, this gif has been special to me all season and know it can be special for you.

http://i.imgur.com/sxxachD.gif
It is truly raining shit on the Ravens.
Oh dear. This season has been dreadful. 
[Hey Baltimore, want to split this one?](http://i.imgur.com/mIFs0xN.jpg)
Wow, can we just apprciate for a moment the massive balls on flacco. He made that look like he just rolled his ankle and played through it to get the win for his team. That's the guy that you want your franchise qb to be, what a baller
RIP Ravens fans livers
How many quarterbacks are we at now that have torn their ACL/MCL against the Rams?

- Carson Palmer

- Drew Stanton

- Ben Roethlisberger (MCL)

- Joe Flacco
Flacco has never missed a game in his career. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/30y7bg/the_ravens_have_signed_matt_schaub/cpwvm7p
Jesus, man. I'm sorry Ravens fans.
Ravens are just having the worst season, good lord.
I am half expecting to hear that John Harbuagh is out the rest of the year with a broken heart
Its time for bionic knees, lets go science, make it happen. Too many great players not playing cause of weak human knees..
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.
Did this happen when his player rolled over his leg on one of the last plays?
Wow. Losing their starting RB (probably for the season) and QB (definitely for the season) in one game. Not like the Ravens needed anything else to go wrong this year....
Offense that was supposed to be Flacco, Forsett, Steve Smith and Perriman has turned into Schaub, Buck Allen, Kamar Aiken and Crockett Gilmore... holy shit.
OH COME THE FUCK ON
Wait what the fuck?  He never left the game.  This is out of nowhere
Kill me
Wtf, that can't be possible. Flacco is an ironman. 
That's the shit cherry on the poop sundae.
What a tough bastard Flacco is. Wouldn't even get taken out of the game when his ACL was fucking ripped. That's our quarterback. 
Well this year has been one big abortion of a season for Baltimore.
This is like abandoning ship after its been wrecked in a storm only to have a fucking whale eat yr lifeboat.
Flacco has never missed a game in his career. 

So many injuries this year and we still haven't lost a game by more than a single possession. 

Although that might change now that Flacco is out. He really has carried this team regardless of what anyone says. 
Just when I didn't think this season could get any worse. Brb tears
This is legit the worst season for QB's ever. Jesus christ.
When is the last time disaster struck a team this badly. Honestly, this is getting ridiculous, I can't remember the last time a team has been THIS unlucky.
What the actual fuck
Sucks, but if it's going to happen, it happened at a good time for them. Shitshow of a season and still enough time to push for Week 1 next year. The only think that really sucks is that they had let Taylor go...
This truly is the season from hell.
I'm feeling really white girl today, because I literally just can't even. 

we're a fucking disaster

BabyRage Never Lucky BabyRage
https://media.giphy.com/media/11PMIEfajGXhGE/giphy.gif
Fuck, there goes his start streak
Flacco for 2016 comeback player of the year!
Before everybody goes nuts on the Rams, the play was a freak roll up on his leg by an offensive lineman.  What a flukey disaster of a play. 
Par for the course at this point.
[sigh...](http://i.imgur.com/J0s5CNn.gif)
And he finished the last couple plays with it... Joe I think you dropped [your wallet.](http://badmofowallets.com/wallets/tan1.JPG)
You all were complaining about the idea of the Titans and Jags game this last Thursday night. 

Now next Monday night you are going to watch my Browns battle what's left of the Ravens for the #1 overall pick in prime time. 
Sorry to hear this, Ratbirds. Looks like the Roethlisberger/Flacco rivalry has to take the year off. Here's to a speedy recovery, Flac üçª 
The 2015 ACL team just got ELITE
Jesus Christ. They cant catch a fucking break. Thats 3 AFC north teams that Jeff Fisher has played against where the QB gets hurt. 
OK I officially feel bad for the Ravens. This just puts it over the top.
Jaw nearly hit the floor. This is fucking devastating.
What an awful fucking season for qb injuries. 
NOOOOOOOOOO
Poor ravens
Goddamn. Sunday, bloody Sunday. Sorry Ravens fans. 
NO PLEASE

YOU CAN TAKE SIZZLE

YOU CAN TAKE SMITTY

YOU CAN TAKE FORSETT


BUT NOT FLACCO NOO PLEASE GOD. WE DONT DESERVE TO HAVE MATT SCHAUB STARTING
Wow, the Ravens can't get a break. 
It could actually be worse, if the Ravens were having a good year then this would really suck.. If it was destined to happen as some knee injuries are, maybe this was a touch of good fortune in some small way. 

Edit: didnt realize his lineman rolled into his knee.. still, at least they arent trying to make a big push for the playoffs
God have mercy on the AFC for the next few years...Ravens have used up every single ounce of bad luck in the universe this year. Things are going to break their way for a decade.
Wow. That is so shitty. What's his timetable to return next year?
WHAT THE HIGH FLYING ENTIRE FUCKING HELL?
When I saw his leg rolled up on, I thought there was a chance this would be the case. He was pretty heavily favoring his left leg. And he still led the rest of the game winning drive. Tough SOB
As a Ravens fan just leaving the game and being a long time Joe "iron man" Flacco supporter, I'm heart broken right now. Get well buddy...
The Ravens finally land on the right side of one of these crazy close games and yet they don't even get to celebrate because Flacco tears his ACL. Bloody hell they must have angered some vengeful god.
Shit and I thought our Season was bad. I am sorry Raven bros. You guys don't deserve this.
Acl team probably would win the superbowl now.
I know Flacco gets a lot of shit over the whole elite thing. But if playing through an ACL just to give your team a shot isn't elite, then I don't know what is.

It's been [thirteen days](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3s5xyr/mcbride_tough_news_out_of_foxborough_patriots_rb/cx9pj7w) since the last addition.  
Holy fucking shit. 
Jesus fucking Christ
The Ravens are officially on the clock...
Well then
Jesus, I genuinely feel awful for the Ravens. They are incapable of catching a break. Sorry, you guys.
Remember that darkest timeline we talked about this week, Ravens fans, well here it is. 
Get well soon my dragon :( what a season. 
Ravens lost their starting QB, RB, and WR. Awful.
well at least we have Schaub. said no one ever.

Fuck everything.
Sucks that his streak is over. 
Flacco hadn't missed a start since the beginning of his career, even when his line seemed intent on putting him in the hospital.

Fuck this season. Fuck everything.
As if our season wasn't over already... Never has a win felt so bad
Hold the fucking phone.

Harbaugh said he finished the series with TWO completely torn ligaments.

It's NOT just his ACL?
Ravens fans right now: https://i.imgur.com/PedE1EC.jpg

Sorry fellow birdbros.
This is the darkest timeline...
Worst season ever for the Ravens? Holy shit man
man, that Tyrod Taylor would look good now
http://i.imgur.com/AWTtc.gif
Ravens are now in the lead for first overall pick
Wait... Oh my god we get to watch Matt Schaub. This should be fun.
Wow, this is one of those rare moments where I feel bad for the Ravens.  Injuries seem to be tearing our division apart this year
The hit looked like the classic torn ACL hit but he stayed in so I assumed he was ok
I wouldn't wish this kind of season on any team. Not even the Ravens. 
Was this a result of the play where he got rolled up on by his lineman?
When it rains, it fucking Hurricane Ikes. 
[I feel bad for you Ravens...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zLfCnGVeL4)
WHAT DID WE DO!!
This is just unbelievable. The man has never missed a start. I genuinely feel bad for him.
Suggs, Perriman, Seve Smith, Forsett, Flacco, Zuttah, Osemele, Monroe... Fuck this season. 
THIS IS THE DARKEST TIMELINE
[Ravens fans.](http://i.imgur.com/Zwr3r7O.jpg)
Break out the deer antler spray.  Fuck.
Jesus, Ravens, just call this season a wash. We'll see you next year.
Quoth the Raven "I abhore"

The Ravens can't catch a break holy shit. Get well soon Flacco.
God is punching Ravens fans in the dick right now. 
Welp, at least the Ravens'll get a high pick.
Love how he finished the game even after tearing it on that weird play where his own guy rolled into him
There goes the #1 pick, Ravens lock it up after today.
Yikes
His consecutive game streak :(

Can't wait to hear how bad we are for not starting Tyrod a few years ago
I'm so sorry Ravens. The injury bug is a bitch and I hate it has taken down what looked like a dominant team. 
Well, there goes our shot at the first pick.  Sorry Ravens :(
Injury gods have been CRUEL to the Ravens this year.
Even when they win, they lose.
[HE IS READY](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view5/4307855/schaub-eyes-o.gif)
At this point I would not be surprised if M&amp;T Bank Stadium just spontaneously collapsed next game. Just the field exploding and falling into the earth, Dark Knight Rises-style, for no reason.
Ravens are now negotiating for the remaining games to be played as flag football 
Ohh, was that when his own guy rolled on him?  He kept playing a bit after that didn't he?
http://gfycat.com/GiddyEqualAustraliancattledog#
Yeah Goodell let's increase the number of games....fucking idiot.
Guys I think when the lights went out in the Super Bowl some awful curse was placed upon the two teams. That the darkest time line would come true. 
We're going to need a picture of NFL starters faded into black and white like they do with the dead characters in The Walking Dead. "I didn't realize how many we lost this season"
Correct me if I'm wrong but won't they be in contract negotiations with Flacco this year? Grabbing a high draft pick and having a little negotiating room with Flacco over his salary cap hit could be just what the Ravens need to start rebuilding. Plus nobody is going to accuse you of throwing games to get a better pick when your entire offense is injured...
[Video](http://www.baltimoreravens.com/videos/videos/NFLN-Flacco-Injured-Against-Rams/55243a63-8cbb-422e-934f-48d84836f27d) of the injury
We didn't do it in purpose.
Hello Darkness my old friend. 
Wow the ravens are getting absolutely fucked with injuries. 
Wait what? Dude was walking around like he bruised his heel
Flacco must be one tough mother fucker. He was just limping around for those last two plays like it wasn't even a big deal. I figured he had rolled his ankle or something. What a beast. Those Rams sure do like taking out quaterbacks though don't they?
Ravens really want that #1 overall injured award. 
There's always teams that have the injury bug.  The Ravens got raped by a plague of them this year.  Hope him and the rest heal quickly.
Fuck this. Flacco has been my favorite Raven since he came in '08, in part because of his toughness. Jesus H...
Christ :( sorry AFCN bros. I hope he recovers well.
I ranted already in the Packers/Vikes GDT. 

I'll just say this: WTF DID WE DO FOOTBALL GODS. That's it every offensive starter is injured. 
Here you go Ravens fans, made this last week for y'all. http://imgur.com/H9xMBTp
What the fuck!?

I'm sorry Baltimore fans, I hate your team and want them to lose as embarrassingly as possible but I never want any of your players to get hurt

This fucking sucks. Hope Joe comes back at 100% next year
Let the Gregg hate commence
when it rains... it becomes a shitstorm
Thank god the Falcons don't have to play them.
Not even waiting for an MRI?

Damn
I want to be surprised but I'm not. Fuck everything. 
Wow
WHAT
The Rams always end up injuring QB's and it is never even on purpose, we even injure ourselves
Rest in pepperonis 
The ravens should just go to each game wearing titanium enforced bubble wrap.
See Steelers, this is how you injure your top QB/RB/WR.  For the season.  None of this 'back in a few weeks' bullshit.
Jesus. And for half of next season too. That's really shitty.
I remember watching the last few minutes of this game and thinking, "How is Baltimore going to lose this game?" Then I saw this headline. 

Injuries suck
In one fucking season we've lost

LOLB, WR1, WR2, TE1, C, LG, QB, RB1 &amp; 2

lol
Does anyone have the play on how it may have happened? 
Jesus. The gods have not been kind to the Ravens this year. 
And now they don't have Tyrod Taylor as a back-up... Prayers for Baltimore 
Get well soon, Joe.
Welp, that sucks. Sorry Ravens fans. Wish Flacco a speedy recovery and I hope that the Ravens as a whole can be back healthy next year. 
You know my friend is a Ravens fan and all he does is bitch about how the Ravens woes are a result of Joe Flacco and Joe Flacco's contract.  I can't wait for him to lament this loss.
FUCK!!!!!!!! Just like our season... finally get our 3rd win but we traded it for losing our QB and RB for the season. 
Dang :( 
Every team that's struggling gets an injury (or an uncovered hidden injury) to help justify their woes. /s
Happened on the second to last play too it looked like.
At least you won?
Seriously what the shit
Even my fantasy backups are tearing ACLs, what the hell is going on.
If injured opposing QBs were wins, we might be contenders.
That really sucks. On the final play too.
This is my fault. I cursed us in the Forsett thread. 
Paging /u/GrinchMcScrooge and his All-ACL team update
Fuck that really sucks.  I am so sorry Ravens fans. 

You can't have Tyrod back though. 
http://i.imgur.com/9T1kgIr.gif
TELL ME WHYYYYYYY

WHY MUST I CRY????
Well I guess they join us on the race for the #1 pick. Baltimore is a good organization and will recover in a couple years. 
BUT IS HE ELITE?????
Rams take out another quarterback smh /s
Fuck everything.
paging /u/CobaltEdge for a guinea pig reaction pic!
This one actually like physically hurts - Joe is our guy, I felt resilience before but if we packed it in now I couldn't blame em.  Harbaugh's gonna have to coach his ass off to get anything.
I hope Joey Bosa likes purple and crabs.
Uber-chill post-injury Flacco locker room interview:

But is he elite?
At least you get to see what you have in Tyrod...oh wait...
The Rams are QB killers confirmed
HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAJAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
I don't think any QB of ours has ever done that.

I've never known what it's like to have a  good QB before. This is... I don't know what to do with my hands.


Sidestory:  holy shit NFL, fix your damn communication system.  
This Jameis Winston kid is looking alright.
QBs *should* call plays more. That's how football worked for decades, and it was fine.

I'm gonna go yell at a cloud now. 

A lot of people pegged him as an "idiot" coming into the draft, but he blew away most people's opinions about him throughout the entire process. Seems like a lot of people were rooting for him to fail too. I'm so glad to see him doing well.
He called a Spider-Y-Crableg-Banana.
I adore this guy. I love that he is making all those people who said he'd bust eat dirt right now. 
Jameis Winston out schemed Chip Kelly... 

This kids trajectory is way better than I thought it would be year 1. 
I didnt know the buccaneers played in Foxborough on sunday
He's gonna own every single bucs passing record.

The bar is set so low, too
FUCKING HELL.

NOW I HAVE MORNING WOOD FOR A DIFFERENT REASON.
Jameis is a borderline savant when it comes to football. I remember an article about him from awhile back that talked about how he would have football and baseball practice in the same day and instead of sleeping all night he would stay up memorizing the playbook, show up to practice the next day and dominate.
I &lt;3 Jameis
I honestly thought Mariota would be the better qb, but Winston is seriously impressing me. I hope he keeps this up.
Unbelievable the kids only 21 years old.
I'm not saying this is false, because those headsets do go out a TON, but does anyone else notice that this always seems to be trotted out as an accolade with young QBs? I mean, RG3 did the same thing in 2012 on a game winning drive, ironically against the Bucs. 

Jameis does look good though.
I highly doubt he was just free styling for three straight drives.  NFL teams have contingency plans for when the communication system goes down. 
JaMarcus Russell 2.0 am I right????
I thought Winston was going to flop. He seems to know his shit though and is showing toughness in a tough position. I guess I've written him off because of Manziel and RGIII and the like; assumed these hot shot rookies were going to crash and burn. 
He did this at FSU. Guy has very high football IQ and is a natural leader, miss him at FSU :(
I &lt;3 Jaboo
I dont always listen to news, but when I do, I make sure its from a twitter account.
*squeeeeee!* Dis muh quarterback
I have a football crush on Jameis. 
Patriots are cheating again
Im missing something here....headsets were out on "the first 3 drives"

This week, 1 TD, last week 1 TD in first Q.

Something is wrong here. Timestamp from 6 hours ago, so before the game, so it has to be last week vs philly, but unless TB only had 1-2 possessions in the first Q, then that is wrong too.
Show ne da TDs
This is because Jameis Winston is a real QB. The No Fun League has been trying for a better part of the decade to eliminate them and replace them with a generation of boring and efficient passers that make Sunday afternoon feel like Monday morning. They want us to believe that Brett Favre was the last of a kind.
[He's a pretty good player I guess](http://imgur.com/gKHmq7o.jpg)
Famous Jamis
Can he be our offensive coordinator?
This kid is gonna be a problem for opposing defenses...
hyped that jameis is legit or sad that a 21 year old can out gameplan and coach better than millions of dollars and thousands of hours of all your personnel?
I wish this would happen to  us.
Not gonna lie, i thought he was just gonna be a bust. Hes definitely playing great
This makes me feel good after getting down voted into oblivion last year in R/CFB saying he's gonna be pretty good in the NFL. 
I love being proved wrong in these situations. I called bust on this kid all along.
Not going to lie: I didn't think he would play well. Dude's been very impressive, and seems that he has matured nicely into the NFL. Being surrounded by mature vets has really helped him adapt well professionally and personally, it seems.
The NFL's collusion with refs is OOC, not renewing my NFL pays for next year. The contests are no longer decided by the players.
I love being able to come to NFL and being happy now, as opposed to a year ago.
That's fucking impressive. Looks like the Bucs found their franchise qb. I really like watching him play.
Remember when that happened to the Steelers and they accused the Patriots of cheating?  The NFL doesn't.  Anyways I knew Winston was going to be greatness.
Jameis to be hired as Bucs OC confirmed.
This is what we need!  Less Kyle Shanahan, more Matt Ryan no huddle. 
Damn, this isn't a good look for Lovie Smith...or whoever their Offensive Coordinator is. But it is validating the fact that Jameis Winston is actually a good NFL QB.
I LOVE JABOO
I truly believed he would be a stud in the NFL and the better of the 2 between him and Mariota.  Jury is still out but this is promising if your a Bucs fan.  
Y square!  Crab legs!  Toot toot!  Fuck her right in the pussy!
Man, after week one I figured you guys got a lemon and we got the Rolls Royce.  Not so sure right now...
&gt;The most used play call during that period was "Fuck her right in the pussy"
Let the fucker play a few winning seasons before anointing him. 
NFC south has 4 really good QB's..this division is going to be really tough in the coming years.
I thought Winston was going to be shit.
It's looking like I was way wrong about him. That's cool too, because I live in Tampa so I want the local team to do well. 
How much of this would be attributable to the fact that the defensive coordinator had studied someone else's play-calling all week leading up to the game?  I mean, I doubt Jameis was inventing completely new plays out there, but if his tendencies were significantly different than what the defense had prepared for, how big a factor would that have been?
Winston's success rate as an offensive coordinator is ~67%. That's greater than any coach in the league.

Are the Bucs making a mistake by not promoting Winston to OC/QB!?!?
I like this thread. So many Bucs flairs it's weird.
That's amazing. Tampa hit hard on this kid.
Is it wrong that I always think of the [C-Bucs](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Caprica_Buccaneers) when I hear of the Buccaneers? *battlestargalactica*
Respect. Dude has matured an insane amount this year.
So what happened to their defense when the headsets were out? Did that have any effect? 
Some people are just out to prove they can, no matter how many times you say can't. 
I blame New England.
Stud
I'm wanting to say he could be the next Peyton manning. Hopefully without the woes happening this year too. 
The fuck. I'm also 21 years old and I'm barely able to call my twin kid sisters to dinner.

Whatever, I played cornerback in high school. I know some of my shit. 
I honestly have no idea what this feeling is. It has been relatively absent since early 2003.
I'm just happy to see Mike Evans with a competent QB. Keep on chugging Bucs.
Winston is going to be a great franchise QB for the bucs
this must been been against the Eagles. anyone would have done that. 
I thought he was pretty dumb? I had that as one of the main reasons I thought he wasn't going to pan out in the NFL, glad to see him proving me wrong every single week.
Headsets out and it looked like the officials had a lot of money on the Colts.  They made the replacement officials look like fucking all-stars.
I clicked on the link and looked at the replies and it's just a bunch of Patriots are cheaters jokes.  WAY TO BE ORIGINAL, YOU FUCKS.
Damn, I thought all along Winston was a sure bust after that Oregon game, I was wrong.
How are they going to blame this one on the Patriots?
I'm confused.  The box score is only showing 1 Tampa Bay touchdown this week?
&gt;led to 2tds

They only scored one td in the entire game though?
They were playing the Patriots this week???
Wow! An NFL quarterback making plays! Wow!
Except the Bucs only scored one TD...
They let a rookie QB call his own plays? Sorry but I'm not buying it. Just because the headsets are out doesn't mean they can't get a play to the QB. He can make his own changes or audibles on the plays called but I really doubt they just up and said fuck it and let him call them himself.
Quick...launch an investigation into the Pats. They must have done this.
Are they playing in New England?
But, he lost to Mariota week one though..
mustve been belichicks fault 
ITT: People who don't look at the time stamp.
Really easy to do...

Muscle Hamster run 
Muscle Hamster run 
(Should be close to end zone)
Winston bootleg 

Then repeat... 
Take That, New England.
Browns fans be like, "Glad we didn't take a chance on him."
The Buccs have 12 points, 3 in the first, 9 in the second.  What am I missing?  Are they talking about last week?
What a GOD
While some sorority girl was out for three hours, Jameis raped her. Led to a scandal and bribing of the Tallahassee Police Department. 

Just to present a fair and balanced picture.
[deleted]
Figures the colts continue to cheat. 
Guess you could say he really raped their defense
The concrete injured Josh McCown the week before as well. He couldn't stop and ran into the wall hurting his shoulder. Shits gotta change before it injures more players. 
If you think about it, an ~~ACL~~ MCL tear at his age is a career ender. What a shitty way to go.

EDIT: was wrong about ACL, was an MCL.
There is no reason for him not to. Who thought that surface issues was a good idea?!

I hope he wins a tremendous amount of money. 

Though I'm only guessing the city and not the team owns the stadium. 
His career is basically over because of that stupid surface. Millions of lost dollars most likely. Hope he wins.
*Wants city of St. Louis to fund new $800 million dollar stadium, please*
[deleted]
Clip of the injury in case you haven't seen. Only one I could find in HD had this audio, but video is by far the best. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HC4SFO3MW0
If he wins he'll have amassed half the victories that the Niners have through 8 weeks of NFL play. 
Thabo exposing the NYPD and Reggie exposing concrete. The champions we need. 
I imagine the defense will just show a highlight reel of all the plays reggie bush has been injured on.
Gym mats.  How hard is that?
The article doesn't mention insurance at all, but it wouldn't be unheard of for a player of his caliber to have an insurance policy against his own health.  In that case, the hypothetical insurance policy may even require the lawsuit before it would payout.
A lot of Niners fans are are pissey saying that Reggie's made of glass and no surprise he got injured, but I think that's silly. This was a freak accident that anyone could have experienced and no one should have experienced, and I just feel tons of sympathy for the dude. Fucking sucks.
A bunch of players should have sued Philadelphia when the Vet was in use. I remember two in particular. Michael Irvin for football and Moises Alou for baseball. Irvin almost got killed hitting his head on that shit astro turf. Alou actually broke his damn leg rounding first base on a double when his foot caught in the turf. There's gotta be dozens more ACL's and concussions in the Vet's wake.
Speaking as a formerly licensed Workers Compensation examiner, this case is a slam dunk. Bush is going to get paid. 
Which is going to cost the tax payers. One more reason to hate public funding for stadiums.
Good for him. Having that surface there amounts to negligence.


I studied bird law in college, but never pursued the career due to other janitorial duties. I can tell you that a duel will be involved between Reggie and the city. Reggie will definitely filibuster the whole dilemma in turn leading him to receive his piece of the hot plate. 
If only there was a wet floor sign he wouldn't have gotten injured this season



/s
I don't blame him. That shit's reckless.
Their field is so bad it caught fire.
He's got hard concrete evidence, can't lose. 
So the owners get all the profits from the stadium, but the city gets all the liability from it....LOL   MURICA! Ain't it grand!
At least he'll win something this season. :(
Anyone in this thread that ever played football knows how dangerous it is to walk on concrete with screw in spikes.  It's like walking on ice.  
Al Michaels: "He appears to have fallen on some sort of slippery iPad."
He should sue for whatever salary he's due to earn next season because he probably won't be on the roster
I'm gonna sue the city of Dallas over my chronic depression.
This is bush league.
Hope he wins because I hate fake grass.
&gt; Holley was a member of the famed O.J. Simpson legal team working with Johnnie Cochran.

St. Louis is fucked.
If McCown didn't get injured I would say he has a 50% of winning the case. Because McCown got injured and the Rams did nothing to correct the causing factor, however, I'd say it's a slam dunk case especially with the lawyers he can afford.
You know where there isn't concrete past the sidelines? The proposed stadium in LA!

Seriously though I don't blame him. Even if he doesn't have a case (did the city approve it?) I would have still filed a suit. His career is probably done so why not try to make an impact.

Hopefully this injury changes things in St. Louis. It's unfair to the players.
We just talked about this in my law class. Glad he is pressing charges, it is negligent of them to not do anything after McCown got hurt. 
Does anyone have a picture of the concrete?
I was wondering if this was going to happen and it did. He's got a case because this lawsuit isn't any different from a regular Joe Schmo working at his local factory getting injured on the job due to unsafe working environment. I'd have to wonder if Justin Tucker got injured on that shitty 49ers turf if he'd have filed a lawsuit too because he'd probably win.
Good, that turf is a fucking joke.
How does that even work?
I was ready to make a dumb comment, but damn. That's a terrible way to get a (potentially) career ending injury.
Kroenke paid him and McCown to get injured to add another reason why the Rams need to move to LA ##wakeupsheeple
kek
Usc to pay legal fees
Former Saint QB, Adrian Macpherson, sued the Titans after their mascot hit him with a golf cart during a game. It basically ended his NFL career. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_McPherson
"I'm gonna sue you back to L.A."
I made a comment over this last week and got downvoted. That concrete pad is an occupational hazard. Reggie gonna get paid and it wont even count against the salary cap. 
I can't say I know all the codes required for building stadiums and and what the NFL requires, but I'd be willing to bet that the dome follows all legal requirements for safety. While it sucks for him and I hope things change at the dome, I doubt he wins this.  I could be wrong though.  
Do you think there would be something in his contract forbidding him from suing if he got injured doing his job? 

I can't think he'll win, but I think this is more to bring awareness to the issue and hopefully fix it in St Louis and other stadiums. 
No issue the guys career is going to take a hit from something that shouldn't have happened
Video automatically started played for week 9 fantasy picks...  automatic downvote
Now they really won't be able to afford a new stadium.
Sue the fucking shit of them Reggie!
Seriously, that surface couldn't have been more poorly chosen unless it was made of Microsoft Surfaces
Really shitty that the city of St. Louis has to foot the bill on this (assuming there is a bill). Especially considering the relationship the city has had with the team's ownership. 
Teddy should sue the Rams organization for killing about 10 billion of his brain cells today for no reason
Good &amp; and he should win
He survived Levi's grass, that concrete must be serious.
I was like wait what until I read the article. Could be a case. 
What is the issue exactly? The article doesnt explain
My question is, how is this prevented in other dome stadiums? 
I bet Kroenke is all "I told you I needed a new stadium"
Why him and not his players union?
Pretty sure he said after the game he wasn't pissed because everyone has to play in that stadium. But why not i guess right? what do you have to lose
I just saw the video. How did he get hurt? Looks like he falls in his ass. Didn't see his knee hit the ground. 
Do the Rams think this will only happen to opponents and not their own players? With someone as valuable as Gurley I'd be doing anything and everything to protect him
It sucks that the taxpayers will be the ones who pay.
I knew buying that NCAA 2007 Xbox 360 faceplate was going to pay off some day.
You think an NFL running back would have a pretty good insurance policy that would cover career ending injuries...
Rams to LA confirmed
I don't blame him, but is the NFL not responsible? The concrete follows NFL guidelines. 
Can Clowney sue Houston?
This sounds ridiculous. Maybe I need more info.
ITT a lot of people debate the facts of a case that will never go to trial.
Skimming through the comments I notice a lot of people talking about the Rams moving to LA like it's a done deal or something. http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/09/27/some-owners-actively-opposingl-an-l-a-move-by-rams/ All it takes is for a few owners to get together and shoot it down. I for one don't foresee the NFL approving 3 teams in the greater LA area. I think you can mark down the Chargers as a done deal and the Raiders would fit in like they had never left. Kroenke isn't exactly beloved among the league and team owners. It took him 5 years to be in compliance with NFL rules about owning teams in other leagues in markets with NFL teams. He only abode by the rule by transferring the teams to his wife and having his son run the teams. At this point I would just be surprised to see the Rams move and if they don't,Kroenke will likely sell the team because his entire intention has been moving them to LA and other owners can sense that.
I approve of this!
In better news, at least it won't be used as a football stadium soon. 
I support this after todays game

Well kids, looks like we're cutting back on education funds so you'll have to sit on the floor and eat your moldy burgers so some rich guy can get some more money
Seriously? Is the city truly responsible for the poor design of the stadium just because they put up the money to build it. Shouldn't he be going after Kroenke or its designer?


I doubt he'll win, but good for him.
Lol
Hope he wins. 
I hope he gets top dollar!
Career ending? I thought getting cut from the Lions was the end of his career, as it should be when a team that bad doesn't want you anymore. Seems more like a cash grab to me than anything. 
How do I get my team next to my name? I'm for the cowboys but i'm not sure how to get it.
Should sue Kroenke.  He has more money.
Wut
This just proves Reggie Bush can't even walk without getting injured.  Next!

P.S. I wrote that in Tony Kornheiser's voice.

Edit:  I knew this would be another negative catchall for me.  I still laughed.  Sorry, not sorry.
For everyone coming in here blaming st louis: the stadium is already being changed, and the NFL said other stadiums with similar designs will also be addressed.  Let's stop crucifying one team for 2 freak injuries in 20 years.
surprised it took this long.  st louis sucks.  hope they move the team.
Sorry, Reggie. That shit's on you.

You've very clearly demonstrated the ability to stop on a dime. You are responsible for jogging all the way to the concrete.
That headline again: Reggie Bush Overspent His Salary, Faces Bankruptcy.
Honestly I don't think it's what ended his career (his career was on the way out).  But still that is fucking bullshit. His was the third injury THIS year.  If the NFL cared about safety, they would have bought pads for the entire concrete track.

Honestly the city probably shouldn't be sued, the NFL and the Rams stadium should be sued, but of course as a member of the player association I have a feeling he can't do that.   

A shame, because that stadium is fucking stupid.   If this does nothing more than removes the concrete, or covers it up during the game so there's some traction, it would still be a good lawsuit.
RIP in Peace Bush's career. I always remember the three big Punt Returns you had against Minnesota that Monday Night game. 
He deserves every penny he ~~makes~~ gets. Pure negligence on the part of St Louis and/or the Rams.
So what if he ran into that metal bench on the sideline and torn his ACL. Could he sue us for having that there as well..... and was negligence for putting that near the field of play where he was running?

I agree it's dumb to have concrete there but there are a lot of things on that sideline that can hurt you.... 
Is there really nothing in the collective bargaining agreement that forces arbitration?
I can't believe this has not been mentioned, but can the argument not be made that the surface has existed for a long time and he knowingly participated in football on the field? Would assumption of risk apply? Hell, if another qb was injured there the week before he had to know there was a chance he would be injured too. 
what a sue happy liberal....
Good luck with that.
I don't fault him for doing this, but from a legal perspective I think it is going to be quite difficult for him to win this case in court. I expect the city will settle for a nominal amount out of court.
What a joke of a franchise
He deserves the money for such a ridiculous oversight but I have to bring up the fact that hes effectively suing the citizens of St. Louis, which doesn't really accomplish anything but grant him money. I get that he has every right to sue in such a situation, and probably should, but I wouldn't mind him turning a cheek just to be a classy guy. Wrong was done unto him, but by suing I feel he is simply punishing the wrong people. For this reason I'm somewhat torn on the issue, but to conclude I'll say he got robbed of an entire football season and I feel for the guy; no player deserves it, especially an injury like that which occurs out of the field of play. 
Seriously...?

BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES
Good. Hopefully this will lead to the NFL forcing some sort of standard onto teams about their fucking surfaces. 
Man, that article sucks.

Where is the video of the incident? Where are some stills of the concrete surface. If this was "not the first incident of this sort to take place there," what were the others?

What has happened to journalism?
He ran like 25 yards out of bounds. He could've stopped easy. 
Why the city and not the team? I'm guessing the city put up the money to build the stadium, but I can't imagine they had any say in the design process.
this is a bit ridiculous but the rams defense do play really dirty. Today vs the vikings they just took out bridgewater, he was sliding but the guy just hit him and now teddy most likely has a concussion
He won't win. At best they make a deal, but you can't sue the city for the field, since it passed all the regulations.
Plus I want compensation for my Fantasy Football team.  I had Bush plugged in as a replacement to Carlos Hyde and he should have scored a lot more points if he hadn't been injured by this negligently slippery surface.
Someone wasted all of their money...
Lol, what a little bitch boy.
Once he gets paid, I'll sue him for cuz #[Merica](https://whereisrusnivek.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/because_merica_thats_why_us_flag_american_eagle_sw.jpg) 

The money will go right back to the tax payers. 
He has no case, he could have walked away like all the other players did. No one is putting a gun to his head and forcing him to play 
Haha what a dipshit.  The stadium has been there for 20 years, no one else had problems.

E:this is the worst sub on reddit. 
And they're given Jeff Tripplette! Congratulations   
Edit: This is a joke
Oh great. Tripplette instead. He hasn't fucked us over at all.
WOW.

that is huge. I don't think I've ever seen an officiating crew benched before.

now the real question is if they are just taking them out of primetime. if they just stick them on our game instead I'm gonna burn down the NFL headquarters.
dont fix the problem NFL, just make it less visible in the public eye.

its like their standard response to problems

&gt;Morelli‚Äôs crew has been reassigned to another game.

http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/01/pete-morellis-crew-yanked-from-week-13-monday-night-game/

So not "benched", just moved from primetime. 
Maybe if the NFL would finally move to full-time officials like the other major North American sports, this would be less of an issue.
What did these refs do to finally get the NFL's attention? 
Pete Morelli's crew was responsible for the 2009 NFCCG. Should have been fired after that game.
Good. Holy shit that was an embarrassing piece of officiating. 
Penalties should all be reviewable. But it should have nothing to do with the geriatrics officiating on the field. There should be 5 guys reviewing each flag in a room somewhere. It will take them less than 10 seconds to overturn blatant garbage calls.  If there is any dissent, let the the flag stand. 

Refs that have a high overturn % should be benched/fired/executed whatever. 
Makes that [State Farm commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDBQr9rOVTo) all the more comical.  
People only want to talk about the Pats game, but JFC 49ers was WAY worse.
This should make me feel better than it does. 
[And shipped them to New England!](https://twitter.com/985TheSportsHub/status/671730499589562368)
Redskins fans I know we don't like Tripplette, but he did ref a good game earlier in the year that we won. Tampa I think? Anyways, it's better than Boger. 
Spoiler Alert: They got assigned to the Patriots game.
The officiating this year has been such a fucking joke. The NFL has lost so much legitimacy. I've never seen so many games be decided directly by bad play calling
Can I petition to have the Cowboys pulled from the Monday night game, too? We definitely have made more than our fair share of errors this year.
I can't remember this happening before. Setting a precedent? 
MAKE EVERY FUCKING PLAY REVIEWABLE, WHY IS THIS SO DIFFICULT. 
Thank God, here's to hoping they fire him and his crew permanently \#totallynotagrudge
And guess which game they got moved to? The Philly / New England game. THE FIX IS IN AND WE HAVE A CHANCE!

Status: HAPPENING
I wonder what those scab officials from a few years ago are up to.
Anybody else think the officiating errors this year have something to do with the high turnover rate of officials in the offseason?  They fired a bunch of them due to bad calls but they brought in less experienced guys who need time to learn.  I'd like people like Mike Carey to speak up and give their thoughts.  Dean Blandino has never worn the stripes.  I think we need some of the more successful guys to take control of the officiating.
This seems to be an issue throughout the league this year. In the Den-NE game this week I thought there were a ton of crappy calls that went against NE that seemed to change the flow of the game a ton. 
http://cdn.bleacherreport.net/images_root/article/media_slots/photos/001/066/428/TLuTPDK_original.gif?1379374608
You missed the most notable part about this.



They were re-assigned to the Patriots game.


No this isn't a joke.




Morelli's crew has been assigned to Pats/Eagles game. God dammit.
They will do the Pats game instead

-RG
It's time for the NFL to make officials full time regular employees. 
Could be worse.  Could have gotten a crew from the PAC-12
Good. I'm liking that sports leagues are getting refs under control.
Are there any NFL referee crews not mired in controversy?  They have all made crucial game changing mistakes.  What a joke.  Allow me to redirect you to the NFL referee website. http://operations.nfl.com/the-officials/these-officials-are-really-good/
MAKE THE REFS FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR FUCK'S SAKE!
do any websites keep track of blown calls and do power rankings of the best crews? I assume this could be roughly determined by who gets the playoffs but that could also be seniority. Would like to see some power rankings unless that gets the Playmakers treatment 
It's about time these idiots be held accountable for their actions on the field.  They should be reviewed, each and every one of them, at the end of the season and those that are found to be lacking replaced.

Edit:  Wait, they were just moved to another game?  What kind of crap is that?
Son of a bitch, I have to watch my team in prime time during this shitshow?  Just let us die in peace for fucks sake. 
i don't do fantasy football, but i'd try it out if they had it for ref errors
So they put Morelli on the Pats game instead!?  A team that just had 2 straight games of bad officiating is now getting a group deemed too good to cover SNF?  
Some of these guys are so old that they retired from practicing law or teaching school, to officiate a fast paced NFL game. Doesn't seem right to me
Did they call pass interference on the person handing them this memo?
Honestly I haven't seen an NFL game this year that didn't have numerous officiating errors, many of which seemed to influence the outcomes of the games.  Most seemed to involve phantom calls of illegal use of hands or pass interference--or failure to call those penalties when they were obvious.  The NFL needs to reconsider its approach to how those penalties are called--because it's not working well as is.
Easily top 5 worst officiated game I've ever seen. The only game that comes to mind that's even close is the Saints 49ers game with Breese and his go go gadget neck.
Oh, an officiating team is bad, better re-assign them to the Patriots. -NFL
this is sure to fire up the "the league hates the patriots" crowd.

the thing is, what would have been dismissed as conspiracy a few years back actually seems pretty plausible today.

(the tweet doesn't mention it, but the crew that was pulled from primetime for sucking has been [re-assigned to the pats game](http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/12/01/nfl-takes-pete-morellis-crew-off-prime-time-game-reassigns-them-to-patriots-game/)).
Pulled from MNF cause they were so terrible and moved to... the Pats game. I hate to jump on that conspiracy wagon but you just can't make this up, sports fans
the NFL has a Problem. Theu sure as fuck better spend some time and money in the offseason to figure our what in the fuck they are going to do about caloling games- these old men can't handle it anymore, games too fast or they are not capable or fucking smething.
So this means basically nothing is gonna get done. 
And put them on the Pats-Eagles game because the Pats never get screwed by refs
Leave them in there this is the only chance the 'boys have to win the game!! Also, if it's really ugly, we can just blame it on the horrible refs. Don't kick us when we're down NFL
Wonder what they'll do about the crew from Pats Broncos
I like Morelli's crew. In previous games they appear to hate throwing flags.

The Carson Palmer penalty against the 49ers is the result of the messed up state of the rules.

The NFL needs problem solvers, not PR people. 


Anyone who has done a real day's work in their life can recognize Goodell and Blandino are paper pushers. 

For starters, the 32 billionaire owners of the biggest sports league in the nation can afford full-time officials with a permanent system of traning and education.


The sack on Palmer in the 4th that became a personal foul was ridiculous.  And I hate the 49ers.   I think it was # 92.
They should pull every crew and have all of us officiate the games since we all seem to know the right calls when we are full of nachos and beer every Sunday.
Did we really get Jeff "I don't know what down it is" Triplette instead?

Holy shit...it's like the NFL cured cancer and then gave everyone Ebola. 
https://twitter.com/SiriusXMNFL/status/671115120752259072

Pathetic what the league has turned into
After Bills - Pats there were crickets chirping,  though. Wtf
Could someone explain to me what defines when an officiating staff is 'bad enough' to be benched?  Because I know of two other games in the last week alone wherein the officiating justifies a public execution of the individuals involved.
There were a few bad crews this week.  The Packers/Bears game was fucked up pretty bad too.  Both teams had several awful calls.  The officiating has been terrible lately.

I just want to be clear, I'm not saying the Packers lost that game because of officiating.  The Bears were the better team that day, the Packers looked terrible and the outcome would have been the same without the bad calls.
"This officiating crew was really bad. As 'punishment,' we are going to move them from a primetime game to another game that less people will be watching/ scrutinizing."
They should all be pulled after this season is over. You are either a full time (365 days) ref or you go back to your day job.

These guys need year round training so they are ALL are on the same page. At this point they know less than fans do.
Why not make them full time? And also actually have punishments?
The league with that troll swap with Tripplette
So did they execute the guys who reff'd the Sunday night game? Or give them a promotion?
They should just make them work the Titans game.

That's how they "punished" the last crew that screwed up.  Seriously.
inb4 they are reassigned to wherever the Titans are playing. [I wish I was joking](http://espn.go.com/blog/tennessee-titans/post/_/id/16341/by-putting-demoted-official-on-dolphins-titans-nfl-not-treating-all-teams-the-same)
Thanks now we have them! These is too surreal to be mere coincidence.
Pete Morelli shouldn't be a NFL referee anyway, guy is as stupid as a rock
So, um, what about the ref crew from last night's clear cut mistakes (2 on the final play/blocked FG alone!)?
This is all on the NFL and not these referees. The Patriots have been involved in three consecutive games where the referees screwed up calls on their own but also got tripped up by weird rules. 

Was ODB's catch a catch? I DON'T EVEN FUCKING KNOW ANYMORE. 
It's time for the refs to be replaced by robots already.
They were the same crew that messed up the end of Ravens Jags resulting in a league apology. [source](https://twitter.com/jeffzrebiecsun/status/671699816955691010)

It is the crew featuring first time female referee Sarah Thomas. Not necessarily relevant, but interesting nonethless. This is not an attack on Sarah Thomas, no idea if she's been a positive contribution or not. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Morelli)

They have been moved to an even more important game featuring the Steelers and Colts. [source](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/01/pete-morellis-crew-yanked-from-week-13-sunday-night-game/)

The NFL seems to think the solution to bad refs is to move them away from nationally televised games and into crucially important games. What a joke.
Lol wow, the officiating in the NFL has been pathetic for a looooong time, and to think that the NFL has NO problem with them being considered 'part-time' employees.

Gimme a break, make these guys full-time and force them to treat it like a craft.

Oh wait...that would mean potentially taking money out of pockets of fat cunts, nevermind.
At this point they just bring in anyone off the street with half a brain
*Ahem*

YEAAHHHH! EAT DOG SHIT YOU BLIND DICKTHISTLE!!

That is all.
How is that any remedy at all?  Punishment won't improve their skill as referees.  If it is a problem of skill, then they should be fired.
Pete Morelli is such a referee name
Is it too late to bring the replacement refs back?
I think if the NFL or an independant organism could give the NFL referees a full time job, it'd stop a lot of errors. 

The NFL do too much money and is a too big of a league to let games being fucked by the refs. 
And those guys are off to the Patriots game, to fuck with the Pats some more.... yay
The 49ers were completely robbed of a win with multiple horrific calls. The 49ers probably win by double digits with a non-biased crew
andddd they assigned them to the pats, because literally nobody gives a shit when they get fucked.
Great, they were assigned to the NE game. Oh joy. 
This isn't even a punishment or a move to improve things. It's just recognition that these guys were terrible, so let's put them somewhere where they'll be less embarassing for the NFL. Such bullshit
Now we get them for our game! Cause we didn't get bent over by the refs enough this past Sunday! 
The New England game had THREE game-sealing plays called back (51 yard pass on joke of a hold, Gronk over the middle got a bullshit OPI, and the sack got a non-existent hold called)

All the while ignoring these on Denver:

http://imgur.com/PVOWYlS

https://twitter.com/SInow/status/671725404483362816?s=09

And calling ZERO penalties on Denver the entire 4th quarter.  And the only calls they did call on Denver were the blatantly obvious 2 personal founds where Talib threw Slater out of bounds and could have killed him, and the idiot who jumped on Brady after he was down for 10 minutes.

They called back THREE Game sealing plays the Pats made.  And ignored everything on Denver.  It was a joke of a game, end of story.

Michael Irving said it best:

The officiating had a direct affect on the outcome of that game, and I'm not sure people care what happened to New England.

You don't, either. You don't care if the refs fucked over the Pats, you hate them irrationally, and it's sad.
At least there's some sort of accountability
The NFL is just like any other sports league now; fixing shit for entertainment
So we lose cause of refs. Pats lost cause of refs. So they should get the 49ers refs. That fixes the problem....
Thank goodness. That game was just terrible to watch.. That roughing the passer call was clean when I saw it.. Didn't know why I saw a flag for that.
So, are there any objectively good officiating crews in the league?
Wish more were getting the 'business'. There have been too many horridly officiated games this year.
Just clone Ed Hochuli and have him ref every damn game.
Bring back replacement refs.
I wonder if this will affect Vegas odds on the game? 
This is pretty telling that it doesn't matter who refs the games.  Football is just too fast and can no longer rely on the human element to decide these important calls.  It doesn't matter what crew it is, they are all terrible.  We need a new system and we need it fast.
doesnt matter. Romo is out. probably wont even watch the rest of the season.
Ahh so Dallas games are more important. Even when the refs are making (or taking away) the calls to help Dallas win playoff games, it only matters to protect Dallas. Makes sense. 
What about that sloppy officiating in the Seahawks-Steelers game?
Nah it's okay. The league will just punish them by assigning them to the next Titans game.
What about their stellar performance declaring the wrong team the winner in the Ravens/Jaguars game? 
So that's one crew... they still need to sit a few more.
How about all of the crews that officiate Bills games?????
Lmao
So should a number of others including the ones at the Bucs game.
I guess I don't understand how errors can just pile up like that. The modern game is *so slow* with all the stoppages and commercial breaks, the officials' tools are so much sharper and more numerous, and the stakes of each regular season game so high that there isn't any reason--let alone excuse--why they can't get it right.

Of course, the fact that the NFL rulebook reads like the tax code is not helpful...
Someone wrote an article suggesting backup or substitute refs for games of the main refs make mistakes. I think that's a good idea. 
Oh hey we got these refs

Maybe we'll actually win

(This is how bad the NFC East and the Eagles are. Truly the darkest timeline.)
they really need to give these guys a do over in the mid week.  I mean if the league is admitting the refs were that bad.....
Anyone know which ref squad gave the Lions a fifth down earlier this year vs the Vikings? 
In all seriousness, when the officiating has been so egregiously bad that even the NFL is admitting that officiating crews are making mistakes that are directly affecting the outcomes of games, why is there no pitchfork mob of team owners demanding better refs or better training?
No Sarah Thomas? NOOOOOOOO!
Terrible year for Pete Morelli couple years he was in superbowl.
good
Thats some good news
Where is everyone getting Jeff Triplette from?

Bengals at Browns ‚Äî Jeff Triplette

Cowboys at Washington ESPN ‚Äî Walt Anderson

http://www.footballzebras.com/2015/12/01/13755/
Refs *actually* being reprimanded for their actions?! 

And by the NFL of all professional sports organizations...?

I never thought I'd see the day. This is pretty big news. 
Good.
"You guys aren't fucking up the Cowboys-Redskins game, you guys are gonna go fuck up some other game. See you next week."
Anyone know why most officials are like 50-60+?
And assign Morelli to the Bills-Houston game.
I feel bad for Pete. He was my Principal in highschool. He's a really nice guy.
Terrible precedent.
Why has the officiating been so poor the past few years though? I just don't get it. I have watched football for 20 years and I just can't remember it being this complicated and this inept. 
The officiating this season has been so bad it reminds me when they had the scabs. 
Good.  Those guys were a fucking joke.  Niners got fucked very hard in that game.
[deleted]
Replacement refs confirmed so get ready for some bad calls Skins
The refs are fine... they just need to dial back the flags.  Let the players play and call only blatant penalties and penalties that directly influence the play.  A defensive hold as the ball is being released on the opposite side of the field should not draw a flag.  A hold 10 yards behind the play should be let go.  Penalties made for safer play should be reviewable, especially hits out of bounds and helmet to helmet.  But overall, fewer penalties is what the game needs.  We probably wouldn't have 60+ combined points every game and defenses would have a chance against these robo-quarterbacks and untouchable receivers.
as a guys who has been watching NFL only since last season and watches only 1 or 2 games each week, it feels like NFL has only like 2 or 3 referees, I don't know their names but I know them by their faces.
At some point they have run bad referee crews through a central hub in new york, allowing central oversight will help reduce their fuck ups. 
 What about the pats Broncos crew
The NFL is over. 
all the pats fans are shitting whistles about now
I like the NFL's logic on this...  each week they just figure out which crew has the worst performance and move them to the Pats game.  2 birds, 1 stone...
It is HIGH MOTHERFUCKING TIME the NFL figured out this fucking reffing situation. Make some changes towards the positive this offseason. I love how shit was bad last year, so they changed a couple things to "clear up" catches, but those changes absolutely just made things less clear. Nowadays we're reviewing every tiny fucking thing and the tiniest bumps here and there are drawing huge game changing penalties. After every positive play for your team you have to hold your breath for 10 seconds to see if some BS flag has flown. Even when these guys do get flag happy half the time it doesn't even seem like they know what's going on either, they huddle for a few minutes and nobody in the stadium knows what the fuck is going on. 

Keep the helmet shit, keep trying to protect against concussions. But aside from that. Let the boys play. Pass interference is FUCKING OUTRAGEOUS. It is literally impossible to compete as a defensive back. You can either shadow perfectly without making contact or you're fucked. This is simply ridiculous. It's not good for viewing purposes and even though it's keeping drives alive, it's killing the defensive side of the game. It's a goddam bloodbath ref wise out here. I'm gonna choose to blame Goodell...
absolutely ridiculous. refs make mistakes. what happened to the refs that blew a random whistle in the pats game last week?
And put them on the patriots. We get it, you're still mad you lost "deflate gate".
So they screwed over the 49ers and *potentially* the Seahawks as well since a Cardinals loss would have been massively beneficial.
Morelli give the Eagles a chance!
Oh good. The officials completely fuck the Pat's last week, so Goodell goes and reassigns the only crew that screwed up more to the Pat's next game. 

I guess if the NFL can't win in court, they feel the need to win on the field.
And now their reffing the pats eagles game what an incompetent bunch of bafoons , they gonna do everything they can to try to give Philly the game these fucking refs can't see
When will someone realize that all the bad officiating this season was just designed to cover up the fact that Goodell was planning on having the refs throw the Pats-Denver game and no one would notice since it's all been so bad this season.

This is not the first time in the history of the NFL where an officiating crew was pulled. What's the big deal?
Fuck all refs
This is just a cover so the NFL can hand pick their fixers for the Dallas game.  Got to keep Dallas relevant somehow.  
well, manziel is the backup's backup now, so maybe he'll go do something stupid this weekend.
Well, Greg Hardy is hosting a Thanksgiving party tomorrow night.

UPDATE: [Party is cancelled. Sorry Guys. :(](http://www.tmz.com/2015/11/25/greg-hardy-cancels-nightclub-event-promoter-says/)
According to your link, the 43-day streak isn't 11 years old, it's from Nov 6 to Dec 29 of **last year**. The 11-year old streak is 64 days.
Thanksgiving/drinkin. I'll take the under. 
Ruined, [Joseph Randle arrested at Kansas casino last night after assaulting security (according to TMZ)](http://www.tmz.com/2015/11/25/joseph-randle-arrested-at-kansas-casino-assaulted-cop/)
53 players on a team, 32 teams = 1,696 players in the league. Based on an arrest every seven days, that's an arrest rate of about 3% per year (not counting players being arrested more than once).

Based on this [Department of Justice data](http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/aus9010.pdf) (see table 3), the average arrest rate for all adults (not just males in the 20s and 30s) is around 4% per year.  

I'm having a hard time finding specific data for males in their 20s, but I'd wager it's higher than the overall 4% rate.  

In other words, despite the image issues, it seems like NFL players actually have a lower arrest rate than the national average, or at least not significantly higher than average.   

**Edit**: who needs math when you have google?  [Here's a great article explaining](http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-rate-of-domestic-violence-arrests-among-nfl-players/) what I found in even better detail.  Indeed, looking solely at males of a similar age, NFL players have a much lower arrest rate than average.  
The all heard they needed a fall guy. 
Of course Randle has to get arrested so we have to go to a booth review where the refs will determine what does and does not constitute an "NFL Player." 
Do suspended players count?
Fun fact: using a poisson distribution, the probability of  breaking/tying this record is 3.79E-12%. 

That's about the same probability as the Browns making the playoffs at the start of any given season.
"Let me see what I can do about that." -Adam Jones
They should arrest the guy that messes up that streak

Joseph Randle was just arrested. The story dropped an hour after this hit r/nfl. I guess he's not employed so the record can still stand.
We really need to start a pool. We could bet on which team the player that breaks the streak plays for, or guess the position of the player that breaks the streak.
In addition to the Joseph Randle free-agent loophole, Steadman Bailey was shot in the head. Not an arrest, but probably worse.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand nope! Randle got himself arrested just today.

* Expected number of days between arrests: 2

Conclusion: NFL players are incredibly well behaved. 
Joseph Randall thanks a lot

Joseph Randle was arrested today
Reddit thread IMMEDIATELY below this one on my feed:

NFL's Joseph Randle arrested at a casino in Kansas for assaulting and officer (http://www.tmz.com/2015/11/25/joseph-randle-arrested-at-kansas-casino-assaulted-cop/)

Black Friday and Thanksgiving? I call at least three DUI's. 
http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2592955-joseph-randle-arrested-latest-details-reaction-on-former-cowboys-rb
Joe Randle was arrested yesterday. Is he still in the NFL technically?
I love that the post directly under this one is Joseph Randle's arrest.
just me, or is it really sad that the "record" is 43 days.

43 whole days. so the NFL players cannot go a month and a half without doing something stupid and getting arrested for it
That is not a "record"
How come the arrest record in the NFL is so bad? Over here in Europe if a sports star gets arrested it would be massive news, but in the NFL it's almost expected. Why is there such as discrepancy?
*Super important and necessary stats*

Assume that NFL arrests are modeled by a memoryless exponential distribution with mean 7 days.

The probability that the record will be broken,

P(T &gt; 3) = e^(-3/7) = approx. **65.14%**

The probability that this record would be broken starting the day after an arrest,

P(T &gt; 43) = e^(-43/7) = approx. **0.21%**


This site says the record is 64 days...so they are 23 days short.  They are on pace to be the longest since the record in 3 days.
Randle's not on an active roster, doesn't count.  
[You were saying....?](http://i.imgur.com/QF4canu.png)
Close call [here](http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14221096/joseph-randle-arrested-casino-following-altercation)
Randle was waived by the Cowboys on November 3. He's not an NFL player. The streak lives.
Dude, Jinx much?
NFL players are less likely than the average 20-39 year old male to get arrested. 

It is actually fairly amazing when you think about the fact that there are nearly 2,000 NFL players when you include free agents. 

http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/26/us/nfl-players-arrests-study/
Luckily Joseph Randle was cut before this incident.  Streak still intact!

ZERO percent chance this continues past Thanksgiving. Shit just goes down.
If a player were to get arrested and fuck up the record, he would be the most hated person in this sub
One hour later after this is posted, Randle gets arrested. Lol.
Luckily, Joseph Randle was released by the Cowboys before he got arrested today.
Didn't Joseph Randle get arrested? The streak is over!
Well, so much for that..

Wasn't joeseph Randle arrested today?
Wow. OL, DE, and DT combine for a total of two arrests, coming in a last place under punters! Way to go linemen.
Does everyone posting Joseph Randle not know how to use Reddit, or  Control-F? It's the second top comment, with discussion on the subject. My goodness.
I can't think of another top tier sport that has this problem.

Best job in the world and they can't be chill. Fucking assholes
That's kind of depressing.
DONT JINX IT NOW, WE'RE SO CLOSE
Why am I just learning of this website now?
I hope Joseph Randle doesn't count!
Joe Randle got aressted today. Not sure if that counts though. LOL...
Manziel will probably go on a binge today or tomorrow.. 
Does Joe Randle count?
Do you have to be employed by an NFL team to be considered an NFL player?  
I guess Joe Randle doesn't count since he's a FA. 
It's up to you now Sheldon
So why is it that so many NFL players get arrested?  I'm from the UK and we don't see anywhere near these sort of numbers of arrests in our football league system
Well a NFL player got shot on the face recently...
How does everyone feel about this? I don't really know what the arrest rate for players in the NFL has been historically, or even the arrest rate compared to other professional sports teams. But it seems like a player arrested every 7 days is too high for a professional sports enterprise.
nope http://www.tmz.com/2015/11/25/joseph-randle-arrested-at-kansas-casino-assaulted-cop/
At my command, our CO would reward us by not getting ARI's (alcohol related incidents). 

If everyone in our command, about 500 of us, could go a certain number of days which fluctuated anywhere from 30-100, without getting arrested we would get a three day weekend. 

It almost never happened. 
Guaranteed, shit is being covered up *RIGHT NOW*
Stedman Bailey was shot in the head last night, I am sure there is going to be some kind of investigation into this...
An*
Is there an arrest rate by team chart or graph?
just in time for the Holiday
They are getting better at not getting caught.
Aaand, it's gone.
Scrolled past this on my front page, just saw that Joseph Randle got arrested.
nevermind
Joseph Randle was arrested last night in Mulvane, KS...
But does Randle count as a player if hes not on a team?
Joseph Randle was arrested again. Does that count?
Good thing Randle is unemployed.
God dammit you jinxed us
Goodell gonna throw a pizza party y'all
Nope, failed I just received a message that Joseph Randle was arrested in Kansas

Because everyone is fucking hurt right now. 
But...Joseph Randall
And the thread right below this one is of a player getting arrested.  Go figure.
Didnt Joe Randel just get arrested?
Joseph Randle arrested three hours ago. That's gone. 
I'll just leave this here. 

http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14221096/joseph-randle-arrested-casino-following-altercation
This has a serious tag and the top posts are all jokes/sarcastic humor.
But Johnny Manziel got benched because of some illegal stuff he did?  Right?  Right???
This kinda hurts my whole "income inequality drives violence and crime" idea. 
aaaaannnnnndddddd it's gone
Didn't Joesph Randle just get arrested?
Randle just got arrested but was luckily cut otherwise he would have broken this
Thanks alot Joseph Randle!
I hope Tom Brady is the one that ruins the streak on the very last day. Gets arrested for loitering or something.
You mean Johnny football didn't get arrested?? I thought he did something really really bad!! 
I mean it's probably been broken, but we just haven't heard about it
Sorry guys... http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14221096/joseph-randle-arrested-casino-following-altercation
Lookin at you Johnny Football... (¬¥ÔΩ•_ÔΩ•`)
Way to go man. Its all your fault...
Joseph Randle got arrested at a Casino today
You **had** to say something
It's funny because the post directly below this one was about Joseph Randle getting arrested at a casino.  
  
http://i.imgur.com/wgw8hOn.jpg
Aaaaaaaaaand...it's gone.
What's worse? Getting arrested or getting shot in the head?
what a world where not being arrested is seen as an accomplishment
I'm very curious what the average is for a non-NFL player group of men of the same sample size. 
Who the hell wants to go to Mulvane, KS anyway
If he hadn't gotten cut earlier this month the streak would have ended early this morning http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/14221096/joseph-randle-arrested-casino-following-altercation
How does this compare to the other three major US sports?
Does a player getting shot count? http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/nfl/article46386815.html

You know what I hate about this statistic? NFL players are less likely to be arrested than males of the same age. It isn't a rampant thing in the NFL.

¬†"Keep in mind¬†Joseph Randle¬†(arrested 11/25/15) is a suspended free agent and not counted."

Aww so close. 
I wonder how this rate compares with other celebrity arrest rates (musicians, actors, nba, mls...). 
Joseph randle just got arrested
Busiest bar night of the year - there will be at least one DWI tonight.
Is it because they are mostly Black?...jk...Happy Thanksgiving Everyone! 
Oh shit. Please not the cowboys, ^please ^not ^the ^cowboys, ^^please ^^not ^^the ^^cowboys, ^^^please ^^^not ^^^the ^^^cowboys.
It's hard to get arrested when the majority of players have torn ACLs.
its a holiday weekend there is a dui or two coming
Stedman Bailey got shot twice in the head.  So this year's crew has got that.
Jinx!
Joseph Randle just got arrested didn't he
Its the biggest drinking night of the year, one of those fuckers is getting arrested.
Sadly, someone will get a DUI tomorrow. 
Legalizing weed in two states probably helps.
That's what you sign up for when you young men lots of money to exercise.
What's the record for the longest time a player doesn't get shot? 
luckily for them Joseph Randle isn't considered an nfl player anymore lol
Reading this title made me envision app the NFL players are standing together encouraging each other.
"C'mon guys just 3 more days!"

Edit: I took a look and there were only 10 posts between this post and news of the arrest. Oh well.
I've seen AD at the EP liquor store by Cub buying a fuck load of booze on Saturday night 3 times this season. 

Given the Vikings track record, we can break this. 
Joseph Randle... not breaking tackles professionally anymore, so thankfully the streak stays alive!!!
as my friend Akon would say...still counts!

Post below says Joseph Randle was just arrested at a casino.  So much for that.
Too late. Randle did it!
Appearantly Joseph Randell was just arrested 
I realize these guys should exhibit good behavior off the field. Teams want that, hell we all want that. But, most of these guys are *paid* to be violent men. They are *paid* to pummel other men on the football field and then everyone acts surprised or disappointed when they exhibit this behavior off the field. 

Not saying I condone the off-the-field bad behavior but I'm not surprised by it. 
NFL's Joseph Randle arrested at a casino in Kansas for assaulting and officer.
You give dumbasses a lot of money, you get arrests. 

They think they own the world, because they play a game.
I guess Stedman Bailey getting shot in the head doesn't count either

Joseph Randle fucked it up, he got arrested 
Not even an hour after this got posted, someone got arrested. :(
Annnd the streak is over..... Thanks Joseph Randle.
Awesome job OP, I don't even know how you can do stuff like that.

Those who may not be familiar with Grange, wiki has a pretty good write up on the impact he had on early professional football in America.

&gt;"Grange was immediately courted by teams in the National Football League. The long-suffering Rochester Jeffersons made a last-ditch effort to sign Grange at a salary of $5,000 per game, but were unable to do so, a key factor in the team's demise.[12] The Chicago Bears ultimately signed him; player/manager George Halas agreed to a contract for a 19-game barnstorming tour, signed the day after Grange played his last college game. The contract earned Grange a salary and share of gate receipts that amounted to $100,000, during an era when typical league salaries were less than $100/game.[8] That 67-day tour is credited with legitimizing professional football and the NFL in the United States. On December 6, 1925, between 65,000 and 73,000 people showed up at the Polo Grounds to watch Grange, helping save the New York Giants' franchise."
Some version of that jersey could make a BADASS throwback. 
"Back in my day, we didn't enter the pros till we were 55."
That looks amazingly similar to the Packers [uniforms in 1928](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UyLHuY8ymUw/T-ikAliomFI/AAAAAAAAIiA/IE7xpn9D7yA/s1600/27-28_colored.jpg)

I think every team had a similar patterned uniform. From my understanding it's because it helped the players hold onto the ball while in a scrum (or whatever they called in in football in those days)
Hard to believe he is 22 years old in that picture.
Chris Berman talking to George Halas.

&gt;I was interviewing George Halas and I asked him who is the greatest running back you ever saw. And he said, 'That would be Red Grange.' And I asked him if Grange was playing today, how many yards do you think he'd gain. And he said, 'About 750, maybe 800 yards.' And I said, 'Well, 800 yards is just okay.' He sat up in his chair and he said, 'Son, you must remember one thing. Red Grange is 75 years old.'

Awesome.
Fun fact, Red Grange may have saved the Giants organization. The Giants had a hard time attracting people to come to their games because baseball, boxing, etc. were more popular. When the Bears came to town their game sold out because people wanted to watch Grange. They made enough money from that game to cover payroll for the year. 

It's in Giant's wiki page, search red grange. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants
For those interested, I've done a lot more with old baseball images [here](https://www.facebook.com/mancavepictures).
The NFL needs to let teams use the leather helmets with throwbacks, it'll be much more authentic.
ILL-
He would've been 22 years old at the time.  Surely this isn't a picture from the debut itself.

[edit - shit, maybe it is.  Dude looks old.](http://rmyauctions.com/ItemImages/000002/2686c_lg.jpeg)
This is really, really, really good. Makes you feel like you're there. 

Kudos, OP, you're very talented, and may your team get trounced in the ass tonight.
Spitting image of Mark Rolston from The Departed, Shawshank, etc.

Red Grange is quite possibly the father of the NFL. Much respect. 
This guy looks like that one actor. I can't think of his name. I think he always plays a cop.

Edit: Mark Rolston. Find a younger picture, it's a dead ringer in my book.
My high school's mascot is named after him. He visited our school way back, so to thank him we became the Abington Galloping Ghosts. 
Looks like he's wearing something from Ye's winter collection

That's a beautiful picture! 
That is an old-looking 22 year old
My grandpa, who was born and raised in Chicago, can't travel so hes alone on Thanksgiving in the assisted living facility. Were gonna send this to him, I really appreciate you posting this, he loves to see pictures of old Bears players.

Holy Fuck. This dude is badass. That is a fantastic, and a fantastic restoration OP. Well done.
Hate to be nitpicky, but my jacket was tan, not grey. ;) LOL.


In all seriousness this is awesome.
I await Tom Hardy to star in a bio-pic.
damn he looks like a beast
I've always wondered this, how does one restore old photos? I've always wondered the process as to how you can change a black and white photo into this.
Fucking outstanding!  Thanks for sharing.
That quality!!
I love these restored throwbacks. The color added and the quality of the picture taken make it seem like it was taken just the other day. Time travel at its best. 
Reminds me of Leatherheads, was that movie any good?
This is awesome. Thought I was in /r/colorizedhistory for a second.
Killer job
Wow, great work!!! 

Amazing detail and quality! 

Do you use a particular program? 
Classic cool. Totally badass.
You should post this to /r/historyporn
My gramma has a hat like that.  She loves it.
That's fantastic. I've done a couple of colorizations but not this good.
What a great restoration
This is incredible. Good work. 
Kinda looks like Tom Hardy
I wonder if the Chicago newspapers said those jerseys were fire. Because those jerseys are fire
I know absolutely nothing about image colorization, but that looks amazing.
Woody Harrelson?
There is a really cool picture of a guy testing those helmets on rarehistoricalphotos.com. I would link but I hate this old tablet. Op should color it

Very, very cool picture.

On a non-football note, I love the way these old restored/updated photos make the distant past seem much more accessible. 
Awesome!     

Also, Looks like Matthew McConaughey on

Annoying watermark 
Imagine, men wore suits back then just to leave the house. What happened? 
That is what a man is supposed to look like. 
Wow that real dope dude. Thanks for the content 
That's the butchest motherfucking thing I've seen all day. 
Great restore! You did an awesome job on the colors!
It looks nicely done.  It is really interesting to see these old photos redone well.
*SWOON*
He looks like a crazy tough guy for a 22 year old.  Really, though; would he just get trampled in today's game?  No disrespect to Red Grange or any players from that era, but I just can't imagine them matching up to the players of today.

Incredible job restoring this photo, OP.  Looks amazing!
What position did he play?
Awesome job! 
I wish fans still dressed like that at the games in the crowd 
Why did he make his debut so late in the season?
Those are some good quality hats. 
After doing a recoloring assignment all week OP this really inspired me, amazing job dude. 

Do you happen to have the original?
How old was he?  He looks 40.
He went to my highschool 
Jesus, did he do a full military career before joining the Bears? The man looks like a grizzled 40-year-old.


You can't fool me, OP.  That's J.J. Watt in the Red Grange biopic.
According to this picture, the Florida Gators wore an almost identical uniform. 

http://m.imgur.com/xllfejb

Who the hell thought those helmets would do anything to protect them? I guess I've never seen a colored picture of one of those, but damn, those look more like a beanie than a helmet.
Still remember that game like yesterday 
The galloping ghost at his best
I-L-L...
Is there a subreddit for full color restored images from a long time ago?
Oh look, we leave the middle of the fucking field wide fucking open again and the fucking bears get another fucking first down. Shocker!
Check out Clancy Brown behind him on the left.

If this keeps up, no one is going to want to play in London anymore.  
EVERYONE ON BOARD THE COOTER SCOOTER! 
The sale is happening soon. It's way too obvious. Can't believe no one sees this.
Clean out the whole god Damn thing.

BURN EVERYTHING
save us martha

Should fire their locker room designer while they're at it.
Chargers fan checking in. WE WANT YOUR PITCHFORKS NEXT!
While its a major shakeup, these are the Lions. I bet they just promote from within.
Forget Caldwell... Jim Bob Cooter will lead you all to victory
Obviously the right move but there's no reason to believe the next hire will be any better. We're all destined to die before the Lions even win a single playoff game.
I'm imaging Martha rolling through the hq on a hover round pointing at people with her cane "fire him and him and him"
They're going after our draft pick! Work your own corner, whores!
This is what the meeting was about with Calvin. He probably said you guys need to trade me or fire yourselves
...and have prompted Jim Bob Cooter to fill all of these vacant positions
This organization is bad from the very top, the only way any real change happens is when the Fords are not controlling it
Sorry if this is a dumb question, but what does a team president even do?
I know I'm a Bears fan and everything, but is Caldwell really that bad of a coach? He took Detroit to the playoffs his first year. Enlighten me here.
This has been a long time coming.  It's what's best for the team, but I'm still a little dissapointed.

This is totally reactionary to the problems the Lions franchise is facing.  If we ever want to be contenders we need to be proactive in dealing with the issues with the team.

Step in the right direction thought, what a time to be alive!
Much needed change, now the right hires need to be made to make sure this doesn't happen again.  Caldwell will probably stay till the end of the season and the new GM will hire a new HC
I'm picturing Martha Ford going Ari Gold style and walking through the office with a paintball gun, taking our front office members. 
Can the 49ers do this 
Why after the trade deadline fuuuuck
Y'all got any of them...

... General Managers?
Shows how tenuous job security is in the NFL. One season removed from making the playoffs and nearly knocking off Dallas on the road, and now you have no job.
Why can't we do this? Fuck Jed York
#Sinners repent! The end is nigh!
Are they also selling the team? Because I don't know if even firing the GM and president is going to have enough of an impact. Mind you, I don't want the Lions to move. They belong to the NFCN, and you can't have them.

Kinda like with the Cubs, I feel like they need to have a total culture change, from ownership on down. As much as I love my Bears and their history, I think we'd be better off if the McCaskeys moved on, too.
The next step is the most important one and they SHOULD ask the NFL for help because they can. They need to hire some fucking competent people that know how to build and run a winning franchise.. I don't trust a 94 year old lady and her team to make those decisions.
I envy the  the Lions
It's been a dry couple of drafts for Detroit. But the Schnider/Carroll regime showed us that a franchise that drafts exceptionally well can go from bad to elite in a relatively short timeframe. 

The most controversial issue moving forward will be whether or not Matthew Stafford is capable of taking the Lions to the promised land. IMO he's sort of in Drew Bledsoe territory: he's a physically talented player who can win games -- and win a lot of them with a good surrounding cast -- but who is ultimately not disciplined enough to win a championship.

At a certain point, you have to stop convincing yourself that his problems can be "fixed" with the right coaching staff and roll the dice with another quarterback. Detroit has a solid shot at the #1 and will probably be in position to nab either Goff or Cook come next Spring. If I were the team's new GM, I would cut my losses with Stafford and draft a first-round QB who will be locked into a team-friendly rookie contract, and try to put talent around him. It's not a certainty that this strategy will lead to success, but at a certain point you have to acknowledge that we know what we can get from Stafford, and what we can get is inconsistency at best. 
Reports say Matt Millen the likely replacement at GM 




Tick. Tock. Caldwell is on the clock.
Perhaps this [guy](http://i.imgur.com/r5yz7ym.jpg) is available. 
The Fords still own the team?  Pssst after 60 years you might want to give everyone a fresh start.  I know old man Ford made those decisions, but how excited am I supposed to get for a 90 year old running an NFL team?
DETROIT IS HAVING A FIRE... ^^^SALE
Picture of Caldwell's reaction to being fired pls
Dammit! Stop trying to fix the problems lions!
I'm not getting my hopes up until the Fords prove they can actually hire a competent GM. 
Good. Lions have been terrible and at least this shows that the Fords will not tolerate being embarrassed like this.
Holy wow
OH MY GOD THANK YOU
They want Caldwell to go down with the burning ship, plus it would do them no good to have an interim at midway through the season.
Unless they fire the owners then I predict the Lions will still suck for many years.
I can't believe this happened.  This is my happiest day as a lions fan.  It signals that Martha and the rest of the Ford's want to win and hopefully will be the start of good things to come. 
And it feels like yesterday Jim Miller was predicting the Lions to go to the super bowl
PRAISE BE, PRAISE BE!!!!!
Who wants [Kool-Aid](http://i1123.photobucket.com/albums/l553/megatron811/koolaid_zpsc33f29fe.jpg)? I'm buyin!
THE RETURN OF MILLEN IS IMMINENT! REPENT! REPENT!
Wow, shit got real in Detroit.
thank you Touch Down Jesus!
Spring cleaning

This is gonna be fun, firing everyone!
We'll have what they're having.
given the president's job duties are mostly business based, not football based (corporate partnerships, vendors, etc) maybe they're just sick and fucking tired of the team being the only non-profitable NFL team? 
They need protection for Stafford. He's on a pace to be sacked almost 90 times between last season and this one.
Does this means the Colts can fire their GM now?!
good day for detroit! this shit has gone on for too long
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Holy Fucknuggets
This season just seems really weird. All these undefeated teams, all the injuries, all the penalties, and all the staff turnover... Is there a record for staff turnover per season, and is it in danger of being broken?
**PLEASE LET THIS HAPPEN TO US TOO**
Mike Smith and Schiano to the Lions confirmed. 
REJOICE!!  WE WON OUR BYE WEEK !!
Peter Mayhew would do a better job...
I cant wait for the next guys to come in and completely suck. 
This is beyond amazing and completely unexpected.  This has to rank among the best days in Lions history. An owner that cares enough about them to make changes when they need to be changed is unheard of.
This... this is the greatest day of my life.
With every Lions story this year, I look more and more forward to moving to Colorado.  
SO LONG, SUCKERS!
Finally. Maybe now the Lions can have a good team.
RUINED
Operation: Git Gud 
who does the firing? the owner? i thought the GM was pretty high up there
I'm amazed. I can't believe they are being decisive about anything.
I think for sure this marks the end of Caldwell, but what does it mean with Stafford? Will the new regime stick with him? I'd like to see a team finally take a risk with dropping a QB who is good, but will never be good enough to win it all.
This is it, guys!  Glory is just around the corner!  I can feel it, down in my plums - nice, Honolulu blueish hue.
Hell Ya Martha - the old gal has some fire!
It's a good day in Detrot. 
Niners won't do the same thing. Trent Baalke is Jed York's Wormtongue. 
[Jim Caldwell right now](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/UQIfOd6X7mI/maxresdefault.jpg)
We'll gladly take Stafford
Why not trade Calvin, then? A rebuild will take more time than he has left, and his contract is going to bury them.
FUCK. /r/detroitlions is so excited for this, but this is not the type of mid season move that good organizations do... This is bad...
And the winner of the Sacko Bowl will now most certainly be... [this guy](http://thesportsgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/lions-fan.jpg)
Honest question, how can you fire the president of a team? Doesn't he run shit?
Jim Caldwell is shitting himself. 
[Jim Caldwell right now.](http://imgur.com/7O2FM6I)
Caldwell's gone. 

It wouldn't surprise me if they explore some of the QBs in the draft this year either. Stafford was Mayhew's guy, and they could get picks for him.
They needed to be fired, but I'm surprised that they were fired.
Stafford to the Redskins.
What would be hilarious is if somehow Caldwell survived everything and was the HC next season, with all new assistants and front office.  
Anyone who wants to trade Stafford: You're insane.  Look how the Cowboys in a couple of drafts went from having a pathetic offensive line to a great one.  The Lions could easily draft a couple of run-blocking maulers at the non-left tackle positions.  Heck, they could have had one the last draft every single round.
I wish the cowboys owner would get pissed and fire the GM and president...
Hire Matt Millen!!!!!
So is Caldwell going to be last for some reason?
What about emotionless Caldwell?
So where are they going from here? Basically the whole coaching staff will be gone you think. 
How did Caldwell manage to survive? I guess they need a bit of organizational stability until the season is done, but he's as good as gone I think.
Well. This is drastic. Does Caldwell make it to Thanksgiving? 
Is everyone going to get fired except Cadwell
RIP
Who are the good gm candidates out there?
THE CHILDREN, SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN 
Bring out the guillotine! Lions are coming for everyone's head. 
Lions fans, who do you think will be the leading candidates for filling your now-empty GM position?

Also, roughly how many couches will you burn if you hire Grigson once he gets shitcanned in Indy?
Niners, please take after this and fire Trent Baalke.
What kind of voodoo magic does Caldwell have to escape the chopping block while everyone around him gets canned?
You guys simply must get your own Steve Keim, it's lovely!
This November I'm thankful for a functional front office.
How the fuck does Jim Caldwell still have his job?
Have there been more mid season firings than usual this year? It really seems like every week someone gets canned. 
What, YAY maybe now the next season won't be so depressing.
So, do the Lions have to play in London for Caldwell to get fired as well?
Christmas come early =DDD
VICTORY SCREECH
Can't believe it's actually happening 
And here people were worried that this week would be boring.
This is good for lions fans right?
Two cleaning of houses in a year, maybe the NFC North will stop sucking so much. 
You better win on sunday jim.....
Holy shit. Has this ever happened mid-season?
How does Caldwell survive this?
Well what can you expect, those locker room pics were a real PR disaster.
Can't wait to listen to what the guys on 97.1 have to say! gonna be an interesting few days.
[Martha be like](http://i.imgur.com/Ybi47c4.png)
Is this real life?
Can we pull the ex Jag trifecta? Gabbert  and Mularkey. Maybe gene smith h a s the inside track.
At this point does Caldwell already have his bags packed?
holy shit.  Lions fans, is this good or bad?
Huh, UK fan here.  I thought these were the guys that did the firing? 
HOLY SHIT YES
So many GMs that seem more willing to get fired than take a chance and do what is best for their team.  What did the Lions need:  A great run blocking offensive lineman.   Last draft there happened to be a first round talent available who is not injured and is from a major program that runs a pro style offense.

http://www.nola.com/lsu/index.ssf/2015/04/lsus_lael_collins_nfl_draft.html


Collins did everything he could possibly do to clear his name before the draft. It was the police who refused to interview him earlier:

http://mmqb.si.com/2015/05/15/lael-collins-nfl-draft-dallas-cowboys-murder-investigation

 &gt;  On the legal front, according to his agents, Collins‚Äô offer to meet with detectives on Thursday is turned down ...

&gt; In Baton Rouge, Collins passes a lie detector test administered by the agency-hired private investigator. The goal isn‚Äôt to convince police, but to persuade wary NFL executives.

&gt; Collins‚Äô camp and police then negotiate a meeting time. Friday isn‚Äôt an option, because Collins‚Äô lawyer must attend to a case in New Orleans. The police, the Collins camp says, aren‚Äôt available over the weekend

http://wifflegif.com/gifs/263361-paintball-entourage-gif. Idk how to link on mobile but here is Martha getting to work today
Speaking from the experience of him getting Revis, Blount and Tim Wright from us and winning a Super Bowl, I can confirm that he is capable of taking our team and beating others with it.
"He can take his'n and beat your'n and take your'n and beat his'n" 

-Bum Phillips
Probably the best description of BB 
His halftime adjustments are so apparent and effective. It's like, the first half is a test to see what he's really going to roll out with for the 2nd half.
Bum Phillips said this about Don Shula.

http://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/sports/sports-of-the-times-at-age-62-don-shula-is-still-going-strong.html
It's pretty incredible how Belichick can take players who pretty much suck and can't even make the roster on other teams and make them look like amazing players.
In the NFL a player's success is highly correlated with a coach's success.

There are probably hundreds of decent players who don't make it because the guy coaching them is a failure.
I mean that's football. Coaching trumps talent to a degree you never see in the other three big American sports. Any team can have one or two or three great players, but your team is going to be 30-40 people on game day. Part of the reason I love the NFL is because intelligence is at least as important as athleticism, and the game is won in the classroom as much as it is on the field. 
I think BB might be the greatest HC/GM of all time (so far.)

The reason I say this (as a homer Patriots fan) is because a lot of the people forget that of all the coaches that Belichick is often compared to, he is the only one that has had sustained success for 15+ years IN THE REALM OF PLAYER FREE AGENCY. 

I repeat, in a system SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED so one team is not dominant for a long time, HE HAS DONE EXACTLY THAT.

Now having the potentially GOAT quarterback sure helps, but still the man is a GODDAMN WIZARD.

EDIT: And by Free Agency I meant the Salary Cap era
https://i.imgur.com/TtRut.gif
What Bum Phillips actally said:

&gt;"He can take hizzun's and beat yurun's, then take yurun's and beat hizzun's.
I'd still take Rex Ryan over BB though
  
  
  

/s
Pretty sure his dad said this about Shula. 
GOAT coach imo
[Great Belichick story when he was coaching the pro bowl](http://blog.masslive.com/patriots/2014/12/tony_gonzalez_recalls_bill_bel.html)
In a relative sense, Belichick is just so much more valuable to the Pats than Brady. You could replace Brady with prime Peyton, prime Brees or Rodgers and obtain nearly the same success, but the gap between Belichick and the next-best head coach is just way too large. 
Bum actually said that about Tom Landry many years ago
As a person who started watching football in the early 2000s can someone explain to me if this is true, why did he only have one winning season with the Browns?
Thats a fuckin badass quote
I think this was first said about Bear Bryant - 

He'll take his'n and beat your'n and then he'll take your'n and beat his'n. 

Definitely was not said first about Belichek. 
T-thanks dad
Sounds about right
that man has the thickest neck i've ever seen
Even if it's misleading it's probably true.  He has to be one of the greatest coaches ever.  Despite things like spygate his teams consistently do great.
Yeah there's no choice but to just accept it. He's the best coach since Lombardi. BB is the GOAT of the cap era and it's not even close.
He took my Browns and didn't do shit
Yes
I'm pretty sure thats a quote that he said about Don Shula not Bellicheck
It's admirable.
I hate that this is true.
Clearly, the only way we will ever able to truly know what team is best is to have Belichick play himself. 
Yeah He prepares a lot. 
&gt;Wade Phillips on Belichick: my dad said one time, 'Belichick can take his team and beat yours, but could also take your team and beat his.'

Bum Phillips' famous quote is:

*"Don Shula can take his'n and beat your'n. Or he can take your'n and beat his'n."*

The alleged quote by his son is very likely not completely accurate and missing a lot of context.
He's the greatest coach since Bill Walsh of the niners.
The GOAT coach and the GOAT quarterback. Say whatever argument you want right now, but when they win their 5th ring together this season, it will be hard to deny.
My bro in high school would drag race dudes and beat them. Then he would let them use his car and he'd beat them again.
Bill Belichick has never been outcoached
This is a very old saying. I believe it originated in baseball...maybe Yogi Berra?
I thought this quote was originally about Bear Bryant.
Why is this story crossed out when there is video of Wade saying this?
Yeah, it helps when you're taping other team's practices and creating diagrams of stolen signals
He really is in line for greatest coach of all-time and I'm sure players around the league believe in this too. Take Revis for example. A player that really balls out and has been consistently excellent since he came into the league. 

The one year he plays for Belichick, they win a Super Bowl and his market value skyrockets.
but can he beat the eagles when the eagles beat themselves?
Can someone explain what he means by this? Is he saying BB overthinks things and beats himself?
Just reading Steve Belichick's book tells you all you need to know. If Young Bill has that kind of attention to detail, he's probably the best coach in the league.
fuck this mean wade
John Fox took *that* Bears team and beat the Packers. That surpasses any coaching feat Belichick has ever achieved.
This is one of the reasons I really believe Peyton is the better all time QB, or at least the race is dead even. Talk all you want about "doing more with less", Brady has had BB, and for team wins and Super Bowls that is an enormous advantage.
Fuck BB
Not misleading. Direct quote from Wade Phillips, 0:17-0:25:

http://www.denverbroncos.com/multimedia/videos/Gronk-reminds-Phillips-of-Shannon-Sharpe/7ae066e7-55ab-42e2-9144-0ca59e5d986a
it's not just misleading, it's nonsense. Bum Phillips and Bill Belichick are from 2 different eras.

Bum is known to have said that about a "good coach...", i.e. what makes a good coach.

paraphrased but accurate.

"He can take his'n and beat yourn, and he could then take your'n and beat his'n."

Grow up twitter heads and make your own history, leave ours alone.
Does a quote from a coach's Dad really deserve to be the top post on this sub? I get it, it's about how great the pats are but come on lol
 Id like to see if he could coach a cowboys win over any team without Romo at this point. Just for one day Belichick cmon
2008 Patriots

[deleted]
As a Patriots fan, I don't give much credit to Bill Belichick, I give it to Tom Brady. Remember, Belicheck had losing record in Cleveland. 
We get it. Everyone thinks belichik is the greatest coach of all time
We get it. Everyone thinks belichik is the greatest coach of all time
That is the math of a cheater
Beleive it or not, Tim Couch actually holds those 2nd and 3rd spots. He completed a 56 yard game winner vs the Saints in 1999, and a 50 yard one vs the Jags in 2002.
Why would all of the Lions players stand behind all the Packers guys? 
And Calvin Johnson wasn't even on the field because Caldwell was expecting more laterals. 
"If it had been in Dallas, it would have hit the scoreboard"... Great call by the boys in the booth
No wonder they were getting ready for some sort of pitch/lateral
Just goes to show you can have the have the lead for a combined 0 seconds and still win
Surprising that there hasn't been one longer.

*The 61 air yards also are the most air yards on a touchdown in the past 10 seasons.

Also, though not 100% sure on source but apparently the longest game winning hail mary was in 1978. The Falcons' Steve Bartkowski connected with Alfred Jackson on a 57-yard Hail Mary on the final play to defeat the Saints.
Hey say it could have been worse. The Lions could have had a defender knock the ball down into Rodgers hands 
But is it the longest TD pass between players with the same last name?
I think what was most disheartening about this play is it occurred with zero time on the clock. Think about that. The clock was at zero before the play even began and yet the Lions lost. I think this officially shows why Lions fans are a cynical sad group. Because even when they win the find a way to lose.
it could've been worse, the lions could've intercepted it, and had it called a touchdown for the packers
"Congrats Lions. You never fail to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in the most mind numbing ways."
- Every Lions fan this morning.  
You know, how many lateral plays since 2000 have actually worked? I can only think of 2 and that is the Music City Miracle and the Saints getting their TD at the end of the game and then missing the extra point to lose anyways. Have there been any others? If not wouldn't it of still been safer to play the hail mary and if it was a lateral play just have your guys move back down the field to get the tackle? 
I guess i shouldnt have fallen asleep during this game huh
I read "Aaron Rodgers 61-yd TD to Aaron Rodgers" and  suddenly thought there was a new GOAT in the barn.
As a Lions fan, I am 110% pissed about this.

Right before the snap on that play, I was calling my friend (Who's a Packers fan) to rub it in his face. He answered right as Rodgers threw it. 
It's a damn shame this pass is being marked from the line of scrimmage and not where he actually threw the ball, which was from roughly the 34.5 yard line. The ball still went a good 2 yard in to the end zone too, making this more like a 66 yard toss. What a cannon!
Plays like this remind me why I love sports so much. I got caught up in the end of this game at a bar in Denver. Just chilling my my lady in a normal non-packers/lions bar and when this play happened. The entire place went bonkers, people high fiving and hugging, who up until that point hadn't showed much interest in the game. It just immediately changed the tone of the place. Also a few minutes later some folks strolled in going "wait this game was over, how did green bay win"? Amazing! 
https://www.instagram.com/p/-23JkXJnKl/?taken-by=brandicle

guy had a great sideline view of it, look how high that thing is
And why has a 61-yard Hail Mary never before worked? because this is the NFL. because if you're focused and in your right mind, you always defend that play easily. Detroit was spiraling out of control the whole end of the game, and allowing that last play to happen was the completion of a tailspin the head coach never stepped in to pull his team out of. Call a timeout for goodness sake!! The whole team was demoralized after that facemask call and not focused enough to defend that last play. 
Incredible play! I think this Rodgers kid is going to turn in to a pretty good player. Saved Green Bay's season. NFC Noth is wild this year, I can't wait for week 17.

I'm biased, but [Rodger's](https://streamable.com/g5dv) play reminded me a lot of [Flutie's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeExa2R2nf0) play.  Drop back, under pressure, rolls right, steps up, unloads.  Not a 1:1, but it's all I could think of after watching that play again.  
the ball traveled from the 35yd line to 5yd deep in the endzone.

70 YARDS IN THE AIR. GOOD LORDY
Is this also the first *game-winner* that has been thrown and caught by people with the same last name? 
I loved that after [Dalton's ~51 yd tipped Hail Mary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hftxypoSF2I) Staubach was quoted as saying "That wasn't a Hail Mary, that was an Our Father". Reason that it isn't on the list is because the Bengals lost that game in overtime. 
I endured watching this game from start to finish because the last two have come down to the end. Definitely not disappointed.
I say this so much, but the Lions have got to RUN OUT OF WAYS TO FUCKING LOSE GAMES EVENTUALLY RIGHT?
the replay of this is going to be on Top Ten lists for the rest of my fucking life. 
Here's the [source](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap3000000593883/Can-t-Miss-Play-Rodgers-Hail-Mary-stunner) for those that haven't seen it.  
Which other quarterbacks could make that throw?
just leave us alone :( 
fuckin a-a-ron
61 yards from the line of scrimmage to the goal line, but that thing was almost 70 yards in the air.  He threw it from about the 36 and it would have hit the ground about in the middle of the endzone.
Rodgers threw to Rodgers, who caught Rodgers' pass to win the game for Rodgers. Then they went to celebrate at Roy Rodgers.
That throw was dope. Still, wtf lions? You had one job
As exciting as this play was, it must be weird for Richard Rodgers that his dad's play was more exciting. I can imagine him talking about it at the dinner table, with his dad going "that's nice son, now get the dishes." 
I want this thread to have 1234 comments. I have nothing of substance to add.
[Hail Mary defense, you're doing it wrong](http://imgur.com/935doGE)
[Win probability graph](http://i.imgur.com/bAEUwOE.png) via [pro-football-reference.com](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201512030det.htm).  Surprised that it appears that Detroit was only 81% to win before the final play.
Lions fans gather in for a hug
That arc though.....
TT got tired of hearing how Rodgers carries this team so he went ahead n drafted another one
I guess it wasn't a hail mary, but favre threw a walk off td in overtime against the Broncos some years ago
https://i.imgur.com/9tui3qJ.jpg
I came closer to shitting myself last night over that final play than any grown man ever should 
In the 1st quarter I was an angry drunk.

Now I'm just a drunk
Wasn't just the distance...

The arc on that thing, sweet jesus.
Oh god I'm going to love this week.
This was such a crazy ending. Me and my buddies couldn't believe it 
Not many with an arm like Rodgers.  

Facemask or no facemask... that was a hell of a fucking play.


Sweet
Why did I come in here?... :(
Nobody knows... the trouble I've seen...
Apparently Richard was suppose to box out in the end zone for Adams to catch the ball. Thank fucking God he didn't box out because Adams would of failed miserably in trying to catch it
does anyone have the last 4ish minutes of the game? last I seen packers punted to lions. what happened next? was it 4 and punt for lions?
you know how sometimes you find yourself just staring at the wall of your office or cube or bathroom stall with a stupid, unexplainable grin on your face?  

i just did this, and and it hit me.  i realized i was thinking about that pass.
He's a baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad man!!! :) 
Today has been the worst day of my life. 
Good to see Rodgers is still young and spritely!
Here to ask a real question not coming here to troll. Do you guys think this should be marketed as a miracle play? It's amazing, no doubt, but to say it's a miracle? I think that's silly. 
[I consider this the longest Hail Mary to end a game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ0UOxrcS2Q)

And before you say "That's not a Hail Mary", have you seen Tebow throw? I considered every one of his passes a Hail Mary. Plus, the dude prayed for everything. That has to count for something.
I had packers -2 praise the lord
I can't believe I missed this to watch the Kings get btfo

I can't believe I STILL haven't watch it

brb...
You got it.
God damnit lions.
Is this the first time a team has been playoff-bound with 0 time left on the clock and then not making the playoffs?
Yeah but do you guys remember when Kyle Boller threw it though the goalpost from his knees from the 50 yard line?
I would hate to be the guy who grabbed that face mask. The Hoodie would waive him before the team bus left, if it was the Patriots on the losing end of this.
Fuck yes! Still on cloud 9.
Holy fuck, who else but Rodgers.
Well Skip thinks it was just a mere heave and A. Rodgers got lucky!

That was pretty crazy.  I really can't believe that worked.  It hardly doesn't but I've seen it twice this year now.  Once with the Texans before the half and this last one.

What a way to win the game.
Seeing a game end on a Hail Mary  just seems so college. I really loved this game, Go Hawks!
Richard Rogers, pride of Worcester!
And it's also one of the worst holding no-calls to cost a game as well.
So many salty Lions fans this morning. 
If only it should have happened.
Typical Detroit 
I feel like the record should actually belong to the Lions.

It's an amazing throw, but I would have called offensive holding at the line
 Off of the bullshit facemask call. 

I'm not impressed 
[ courtesy of the Minnesota Vikings](http://m.imgur.com/vJlHE1n)
I could make this throw with my entire O-Line holding too. 
I'll take one free play, please.
At the end of the botched lateral play Rogers rolled over calling for a flag. But not for a face mask but for being thrown face first into the turf. He knew there was no facemask penalty. He is smart enough to take with the refs gave him and has kept his mouth shut about what really happened. 
Fuck you
Anybody else think that it shouldn't have even happened because the penalty shouldn't have been called and this record is tainted or am I just a crazy person?
Packers know all about game-winning, game-ending Hail Mary's!
*
not even a link to the replay? or gfy
Isn't a hail Mary when you bomb it long on the last play out of desperation? Can there be a hail Mary that isn't a last play, game winning attempt?
wasn't a hail mary that worked, but didn't brady throw a ball 70ish yards on the 2nd last play of super bowl 42?
The whole NFL has an asterisk next to it now. I was all, 'Oh the Patriots are ruining the integrity of the game' For that I apologize. I still love to hate the Patriots but I apologize. It is the officiating that is ruining the game. 
‚ÄúI think Tom is one of the most consistent players that I've ever coached.  He works hard every week.  There are no ups and downs with him. ‚Äù

-Bill Belichick speaking about Tom Brady in 2006


I just really hope that neither Dean or John Spanos is on the field for this.  The crowd will boo them and taint the ceremony. LT deserves better 
Here's your obligatory reminder that LaDanian Tomlinson once scored 31 touchdowns *in a fucking season.*
If Melvin Gordon ever scores a TD we need a homage. 
So soon? Surely he'll return for one more season.
I'm glad both the fans and LT himself get to experience this before the franchise moves. He seemed like a class act and is certainly one of the all-time greats. I'll never forget the season he set the TD mark, he was can't-miss TV. It always seemed so fitting to see that bolt on his helmet because the dude was just electric on the field. 
it's crazy how Rivers played with LT and Gates in their primes and never even made it to a Super Bowl 
His stiff-arm was a thing of beauty.
If you had LT on your fantasy team in 2006 you won your league.
And the game should have been on Sunday night before it was flexed out for Cardinals/Bengals. Sorry guys :(
[LT's most iconic moment](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g6_JEpMO_MM)
They will honor his legacy as a San Diego Charger by not letting anyone wear #21 and not playing any more games in San Diego.
You're damn right. Guy gave me nightmares for years.
It breaks my heart that he never got a ring with breeze or rivers. The chargers got so close so many times. 
Here's a highlight video of his career http://youtu.be/dzqUvuS7e9c
Love LT. He was awesome. The guy that all the kids were trying to emulate out in the schoolyard.

Having said that, I find his "I'd rather be in the HOF than have a SB ring" mentality a little odd.

Surely most players don't feel that way? 
He was my childhood hero growing up in San Diego. I watched Gwynn hit his 3000th hit when I was very young, but LT was San Diego in the 2000s. He'll forever be my sports icon and I'm so thankful I got to witness his greatness for so many years. No Charger would ever want to wear #21 after him, he's the best player in the franchise's history (no disrespect RIP Mr Seau). Love you LT. 
That was my 2nd favorite player growing up
In his prime, he was literally everything you could want from an NFL RB.

He could [pound it between the tackles](http://gfycat.com/RashBeneficialLaughingthrush) or [bounce it outside](http://gfycat.com/JovialClearcutKakapo) - he'd run [through you](http://gfycat.com/MenacingForsakenIndianabat), run [around you](http://gfycat.com/PessimisticAngryBunting), or just flat out [burn you](http://gfycat.com/MassiveFoolishAmericanpainthorse). Of course he was an excellent [receiving back](http://gfycat.com/GrandSecondArmadillo) as well.

Oh yeah, and [he could pass](http://gfycat.com/WebbedImpishHammerheadbird).
Maybe there will be more Chargers instead of Chiefs fans in the stadium Sunday.
I'll be at the game! Woo! 
I was debating whether to wear my LT jersey around on campus today since the Browns are on their bye week. Now I have an excuse!
One of the greatest
I hope we don't embarrass ourselves, like accidentally setting the jersey on fire. 
my formative years were spent in Detroit‚Ä¶to which I followed Barry Sanders fondly. without a doubt he was the best RB i have ever seen. He would easily champion every RB stat category if he didn't retire so soon. there are many greats but NO ONE could run like B. Sanders‚Ä¶..

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶L.T. came pretty damn close. only RB who ever impressed me on that same level for pure skill as a runner and field vision. 
About damn time.
Man, was he fun to watch. Since he was like the premier runningback when I started watching football intently, he is ingrained in my mind as like the ideal, prototype runningback. His size, running style, body type, etc. is sort of permanently how I perceive what a runningback should be. I think I'll probably always have that sort of image in my head.
An absolute legend.
Good. He's my favorite football player ever right next to Hines Ward. I'm actually wearing LT's Jet jersey today.
He deserves this. Such a great back.
My best memory of him is when Denver had Ebunezar Ekuban (I know I spelled that wrong) cover him out of the backfield. It was hilarious. If someone has a video, I would love to see it. I hope someone else remembers this as well.
Today's the day I've been waiting for. To watch my favorite player get his number retired! So happy and I hope Rivers can pull a win out for his old running back. 
Absolutely well deserved. Nobody could take over a game as well as he could. I don't know if there's some confirmation bias involved because he always mushroom slapped us, but there's no other running back in history I would rather have on my team. 

Respect LT.
He definitely deserves that honor. He's probably my favorite player that didn't play for the Steelers
No-brainer. 
Miss watching that dude play. I would watch chargers games just to see him run.
Looking forward to the speech by my man Lo Neal. 
LT and Priest Holmes in their prime. Whoooole lotta TDs in the AFC West
Good. He's one of the best players of all time and my second favorite non-Cowboy (Favre) ever. 
And I'll be there! LT deserves more than we've ever given him in his career but it will be a great day for him the charger fans and his wife is singing the national anthem which is pretty cool. 
I am happy about this, LT was one of the most influential players in the league while he played.

Ever since I was little, I always heard his name.  Truly an all-time great.
I loved how his facemasked looked like the front of a train!
About time. 
Miss him in the powder blues :,)
I'm a loyal Colts fan and have been since the Harbaugh/Faulk years when my dad took me to my first games at the RCA. Only one player ever made me question my loyalty and that was LT.

I've still got a powder blue 21 hanging in the closet.

Fuck he was so good despite playing in the wrong era for his position.  If I had to pick a best all-around back of all time he's on the short list with Walter.
The other LT certainly deserves it. He was a great player for years 
Good. All time great. 
Well deserved! 
Always loved that guy, even when SD owned the Broncos.
As it should be.
Rightfully so... That guy was a stud.
Loved watching him on NFL Primetime.  Whoop WhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWhoopWHOOP
A possible 21 reasons to stay campaign underway?
 -q
This is the only reason why I am going to todays game
Well deserved.  He is easily one of the most dominant running backs of the last 25 years
They haven't already done that?!
Dude was so legendary they made an anime based off him.(eyeshield 21)
LdT was undoubtedly one of the greatest RBs to ever step on the field. He wasn't the biggest or fastest RB, but he was good at every facet of the game and could also come out of the backfield for a pass. Well-deserved.
Gotta be honest, I thought we did this already.
Always dominated the Broncos, well done. In fact I think he set the single-season record against the Broncos.
Was supposed to go to this game today but my brother and I couldn't get our shifts covered. Had tickets and everything :(
Tomlinson deserves this but I really cant stand him being called "LT" that is and always will be Laurence Taylor. 
Ah yes, Jets great Ladanian Tomlinson
Well

duh
My buddy just saw LT at a bar last night while watching the fight. I'm a bit jealous 
AKA Chiefs ruin another momentous occasion.
[Turn on the waterworks, LT is going to be crying like a baby the whole day.](http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/gallery/kydsct-b78610073z.120100224205435000ga6mqiq7.2.jpg)
One of the best regular season players of all time. 
Why
And the tears that go with him?

Sorry, just a Pats fan and thats all I remember
Why are the Chargers retiring the number of a Jets legend like LT?
Chargers be like...  Well since we don't have much else.... 
Cincinnati in 2008

Buffalo in 2012

Tennessee in 2013

Houston in 2014

NY Jets in 2015
No matter where Fitzpatrick signs, he always ends up starting. It's an inevitability.
This is the most creative way for a team to suck I have seen in a while.

Congrats Jags fans!
That's like the opposite version of Josh McCown versus the Rams stat.  McCown lost the Rams as a starter on 4 different teams?

*I am still mad at my parents for not naming me after, at the time, a 3 year-old Adrian Peterson*
Fitzpatrick is like a gun-for-hire mercenary. He has no loyalty to any team - his loyalty is to anyone desperate enough to need him. 
Maybe this says more about the Jets but Fitz has been the best QB this team has had since that Favre season. And Chad Pennington going back further.  To have a competent player at the position is a huge upgrade. 
Jesus H Fuck. What do you guys tailgate with down there to make the games palatable? Mad Dog 20/20?
Do you believe in fitzmagic?

In a young jets heart

How the music can free them

whenever he starts


If I had to choose one man for my daughter to date when she's older I pray it would be Eli Manning
I think the inverse statement is of more significance here.
Miss you Fitzy :'( 
Now that the Bengals are inexplicably good, I think we need to resurrect the Dalton Line hypothesis and apply it to Fitzpatrick.

Where Dalton (of previous seasons) described the minimum level of play required for a quaterback in the NFL to keep his franchise job, Fitzpatrick clearly defines the **maximum** effectiveness possible for a quaterback who **can't** keep a starting job.

Unfortunately while Dalton's Line was a clear statistical effect due to his reliable mediocrity, Fitzmagic's is going to be harder to measure given that his performance is all over the map.  New methods of analysis are needed.
To complete the circle Jags should bring him on as a QB and Fitz promptly loses the first game he starts with them.
How did Testeverte not do this
The Jags lost to Fitzpatrick on five different teams?
In 2005 the rams drafted Ryan Fitzpatrick to be a backup qb. Rather than being relegated to the bench he escaped to free agency. Now he survives as a quarterback of fortune. If you have no NFL qbs on your active roster, if you have talented players at every other position, and if you play Jacksonville this season perhaps you too can hire... Fitzmagic 
Ryan Fitzpatrick - The Jaguar Slayer!
Fucking pathetic.
Fitzpatrick is full of all sorts of voodoo magic. 
What does this say about

a)  the Jags?

b)  Ryan Fitzpatrick?
The Jaguars already are scheduled to play Kansas City, Chicago and Detroit next year. One of those might have a chance for a QB change... or he could always return to the Texans.
Ryan Fitzmagic*
I think Kyle Orton got the Packers 3 times on 3 teams.
Man...Fitzpatrick been doing very well for himself....*Sigh*
We were so close too...this is the most frustrating season as a Jags fan I can remember since 08.
A testament to how much no one wants him?  Or to his determination and staying power?
Can we get Fitzpatrick next?
ITT: lost bets...
Of the 14 QB's taken in the 2005 draft Fitzpatrick has thrown the second most TD passes with 136. Only Aaron Rodgers has more with 245.Of course he's also thrown the most INT's with 108 but I think if he had more consistency with coaching earlier in his career that number might be lower. Not bad for the last QB drafted and 6th to last draft pick.Not gonna list them all but here are the top QB's from that draft listed by number of TD passes.

Aaron Rodgers,1st round,24th overall. 245 TD passes,60 INT's and 20 rushing TD's.

Ryan Fitzpatrick,7th round,250th overall. 136 TD passes,108 INT's and 12 rushing TD's.

Alex Smith,1st round,1st overall. 131 TD passes,79 INT's and 7 rushing TD's

Kyle Orton, 4th round,106th overall. 101 TD passes,69 INT's and 4 rushing TD's.

Matt Cassel,7th round,230th overall. 100 TD passes,74 INT's and 5 rushing TD's.

I only bring it up because I think Fitzpatrick is underrated. In a 2005 re-draft I don't think it would be much of a shock for him to be a late 1st round/early 2nd round pick.
Which team gets him next year? After all, his contract expires.  
#jagginoff
Does...does this mean the beard is truly a pussy slayer?

*ignore me I'm workweek drunk*
I feel like im one of the few that actually really likes the bearded wonder. 
It's like their fates are forever intertwined in mediocrity.
Classic Jags
How much you wanna bet he ends up at San Francisco next year 
I see Fitz as a guy who wants nothing more than to be a backup quarterback and collect his pay checks, but he keeps getting forced into starting year after year. 
FITZ-MAGIC!!!
It wasn't us! 
It took 3 times with Buffalo but whatever....  
LET'S ALL PISS ON THE JAGS!!
I mean... it's a very specific achievement
This sounds a lot like my ESPN alerts
One day i wont have to look at ridiculous stats about jax's ability to lose games.
Jacksonville's number one public enemy.
Dude, I have never lost to the Jags.
Congrats?
He aint called Fitzmagic for nothing!
GOAT
Do you think these guys are just scouring for the weirdest stats? Like how do you even realize this
Who finds stats like this?
Fitzmagic
IDK if this speaks to Fitz status as a serviceable journeyman or JAX poor play over the last 7 years...
First ballot HOF'er.
Not a lot of guys have lasted as long as Fitz has in the NFL, and typically, the QBs who do last that long tend to do it with one or two teams. Few QBs have played for as many teams as Fitz has. 
Who's job is it to find stats like this? 
Wonder what happen if he join jax
Let's not get all crazy about this, it is Jax after all. I'm thinking most QBs put on that situation could do the same. And yes, I'm aware Buffalo lost to them this year. And no, I don't want to talk about it. And yes, I'm still pissed. 
Odd that hes stayed in the AFC all these years. 
Elite status confirmed
Does the NFL have a record for everything?
rekt
G.O.A.T.
Awesome I can say I witnessed history Sunday.
This is more of a testament to how bad the Jaguars have been.
GOAT.
So how does the Jaguars feel about this? 
[deleted]
Wow, what a cool stat. He should be super impressed that he can't stay on a single team 
what a dumb stat
a bad quarterback and an even worse team combine to make for an odd AF stat
Yeah... But it's Jacksonville.
The most boring stat ever.
It was like 2 minutes before the press came in. Watch the video it's kinda funny.

EDIT: [video](http://www.csnbayarea.com/49ers/gabbert-arrives-empty-media-room-ill-be-one-asking-questions/)
&gt;The #49ers did not list him on today's schedule so the media didn't know.

what can't the organization fuck up?
AMA request: Blaine Gabbert. We'll show up, Blaine.
Blaine should've started asking himself question.

"Blaine, do your dashingly good looks and ability to attract sexy women ever hinder your performance on the field?"

"First of all, great question. Yes, my amazing looks can be distracting at times but generally I'm able to keep my focus on football. ."


Same thing happened to Eli, there is a video of it. Shit is hilarious. 

Edit: http://youtu.be/89pMD-v3BuQ here's the video
"Alright any questions?"

"Did you remember to bring the lunch I packed for you?"

"Yes I did mom"

WHOA THERE MOTHERFUCKER
 Would have been an awesome opportunity for any wandering press. An entire press conference of one on one time with a starting QB.
Well the 49ers are having season and it seems no one showed up for that either... 
this reminds me of that one time eli manning had a press conference with 1 guy. i felt kinda bad for the kid LOL. here's the link to it, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89pMD-v3BuQ
Awww :(
Hahahaha

Fuck
If he was the only one there... then WHO TOOK THE PICTURE!? /s
Blaine the mono
He handled it like a boss though. Props to him for taking it all in stride.
Didn't this happen to Eli once?
fuck the media I'm team
Gabbert now. 
If Gabbert has a press conference, but no one is around to see it, is he still a quarterback?
Damn, even the reporters are fair weather.
Is this the fucking Onion? I didn't think things like this happened in real life
I feel like this is a pretty good statement about the season as a whole. It makes me sad. :(
Well, it's the day before Thanksgiving. Everyone wants to go home early.
Obligatory Vincent Vega gif.


&gt; 49ers didn't list him on the schedule. 


Go Niners!
Well that's depressing
Its so relieving not to be the team that is completely mishandling their qb situation for at least a few weeks.

We are a brotherhood of terrible ownership 49ers fans.
Tough week to be a 49ers and Lakers fan.
Now these are the Niners I grew up with 
To be fair most of the Niners haven't really shown up this season either. 
No one's gonna post Cutler's? Ok here you go: http://www.nfl.com/videos/chicago-bears/0ap3000000444683/Cutler-stood-up-by-media-at-postgame-news-conference
WE LOST TO THIS MAN
I'm just picturing these two reporters running into each other and having this conversation:
Reporter #1: "Hey man, you going to Gabbert's thing today?
Reporter #2: "Who?"
#1: "Blaine Gabbert.... The quarterback of the 49ers."
#2: "You mean Colin Kaepernick?"
#1: "No dude Kaepernick got benched and put on IR. Gabbert's their qb now."
#2: "Gabbert...Gabbert...Gabbert... where have I heard that name before? Wait wasn't he that Jags qb who flamed out with like Ryan Leaf levels of awfulness?"
#1: "Yeah that'd the one."
#2: "Dude are you kidding me? Did you ever watch him play in Jacksonville? There's no way in hell anyone would ever let him near a football again, much less as the starting qb of a freakin pro football team! That dude is out of the league."
#1: "Are you sure? I could've sworn I saw a memo that he was holding a press conference."
#2: "Dude you're fucking high. I wouldn't want to live in the universe where Colin freaking Kaepernick, a guy who's been to the super bowl, gets benched for a guy who got cut by the fucking jags."
#1: "Ok I guess you're right. Yeah now that I think about it that does sound pretty stupid. Thanks for talking some sense into me."
Blaine's life matters :/
Sorry Gabs, that's sad
I'd like to imagine he went there and just sat in the room for about 10 minutes. 
Lmfao
Who took the picture then?
gabbert seems to be a very good qb, has potential. 
Good sport. 
He could of did a spontaneous AMA
gabbert even interviews 100 times better than Kaep on his best day.
There's a metaphor in here somewhere for the 9ers last twelve months.
this is a dumb story and i'm tired of seeing it everywhere. well he ended up with more media attention than his stupid press conference would have gotten. 
But why?  The Ravens and Chargers imploded out of the blue. 
Eh, the team around him pretty decent.

The problem is that they are all watching the game in gym shorts.
What I dont understand is it seems like this same thing has happened in San Diego every year for the last 3-4 years. 
Philip Rivers + Calvin Johnson + Barry Sanders for the All-Players-We'd-Really-Like-to-See-Succeed-Because-They're-Good-But-Their-Organization-Sucks team.

Who else can we get?
Everyone wants to look at our injuries to say that we're doing bad, but they don't look at this poor team. Phillip Rivers is the only constant as everyone is getting hurt on this team. 18 players on their injury report, that was 33 percent of the team and most of them are starters.
From San Diego Union Tribune writer Kevin Acee:

"This should not be happening.

It is sad almost to the point of being sadistic, even if the guy it is happening to doesn‚Äôt think so.

Philip Rivers showed faith, and it has not been rewarded. His faith remains.

Three months after committing to be a one-team man for his entire career, Rivers is wasting away on that team. He is a good quarterback being held back from greatness. He is finding out why we maybe just can‚Äôt have nice things in San Diego.

Perhaps never before has a better quarterback been squandered as egregiously as what is happening here now.

This is not merely an opinion. It is an assertion supported by staggering data.

In 46 years since the NFL-AFL merger, 236 teams have been 2-7 or worse nine games into a season. The 2015 Chargers are one of those teams.

Rivers has a 100.7 quarterback rating this season. The quarterbacks on the other 235 dreadful teams averaged a 61.5 rating.

That‚Äôs more than a 40-point difference, in case the combination of shock and mathematics was too confounding. Just three other quarterbacks on those other 235 teams started all nine games and had a rating over 90.0.

Only Jeff Garcia of the 2000 San Francisco 49ers had a higher quarterback rating on a team this bad. On those 2-7 49ers, Garcia was throwing to a still-fantastic Jerry Rice and an entering-his-prime Terrell Owens, and Garcia was backed by a running back (Charlie Garner) who would gain more than 1,100 yards.

Too, that was Garcia‚Äôs best statistical season. He finished 2000 with a 97.6 rating (10 points above his career average) and exceeded 4,000 yards for the only time in his 10-year career. Rivers‚Äô career rating is 96.1, and he‚Äôs well on his way to his seventh 4,000-yard season.

But let‚Äôs not get bogged down in a Garcia-Rivers deliberation. We are, after all, talking about QBs on 2-7 teams.

‚ÄúFirst of all, I want to make sure it‚Äôs known I accept responsibility for some of being 2-7,‚Äù Rivers said Wednesday. ‚ÄúI want to make sure I acknowledge that, gosh, there are plays in these games that are close where maybe you‚Äôre a little banged up, maybe you‚Äôre a little young, well, then make a play for us. I accept that responsibility. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sick after these games. Y‚Äôknow, yeah, I had a good game. But, gosh, make another play and you can help win the game.‚Äù

Gosh is right. It is impossible to not love that, want more for a man who talks that way with a sincerity as hot as the sun.

So much of what Rivers said was indicative of why he is the leader he is, why he is the Chargers‚Äô greatest hope that they won‚Äôt stink every year. And that is super.

But I call bull. Not on Rivers, so much, as on the position he‚Äôs in.

He is playing as well as ever, maybe better than ever. But time does not stand still. He has four years left on his contract, after which he will be 38 years old. With the way things have gone in recent years ‚Äîall years? ‚Äîit‚Äôs a lot easier to see his career bleeding out than to see him standing in the middle of falling confetti.

What a waste.

What a joke.

Rivers is a championship quarterback.

I‚Äôve said this before. If I have to say it again, well, some people making decisions for this team need to be working somewhere else ‚Äî like selling insurance.

Fix this, Tom Telesco, John Spanos, et al.

You must.

I asked Rivers if he ever regretted even a little bit signing a four-year extension this summer. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù was the implicit answer.

‚ÄúThe re-signing thing is two-fold,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs thankfulness for the commitment and wanting to finish here. And I want to finish it the right way. Thankfully, I‚Äôm going to have outlasted a whole wave of players. It‚Äôs (Jason) Verrett and Keenan (Allen) ‚Ä¶ Who is the new core. Is it Manti (Te‚Äôo)? It‚Äôs me believing those guys are going to become that and you believe in the guys upstairs that are going to continue to try to build this thing and make it go.‚Äù

Rivers at one point paused as he was listing players and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to leave young guys out who are going to become core guys.‚Äù But rest assured, he need not bother racking his brain because he already named most of the potential impact players.

To break the awkward silence that ensued, I told Rivers that several people ‚Äî fans, players, coaches and others around the NFL ‚Äî had expressed the sentiment that they were most sorry for him when they watched the Chargers struggle this season.

‚ÄúThey shouldn‚Äôt feel bad for me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got the best family in the world, and I get to come here and stinking try to lead an NFL football team.‚Äù

To avoid another weird moment, I refrained from telling him he‚Äôs no longer leading an NFL-caliber team. He wouldn‚Äôt like that. He won‚Äôt put down a teammate.

Sure, he sometimes looks around a huddle and wonders how it got to this point, but he has an inspiring and infuriating ability to envision a sand castle in a pile of dung.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to do it,‚Äù he said of his thought going into every game, entering every offensive series. ‚ÄúI care about the people in there. I like the people. It‚Äôs, ‚ÄòAll right, who we got? Let‚Äôs go.‚Äô ‚Äù

I‚Äôm angry. I sometimes wish Rivers were angrier about this injustice. But he sees potential where we see pitiful.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not that far off,‚Äô he said. ‚ÄúI know it sounds crazy. But we just need a few pieces here and there and then these young guys become the core group that sets the tone in the building, we can turn this around.‚Äù

If mostly because of him, they have to."
Their Offense looks great until these injuries.  Defense sucks though.  They were much better than their record, they kept losing by only a few points to good teams.
The team around him started well then kept getting injured.
This season is just a trainwreck--I can't look away.  I honestly thought they'd be a playoff team, and if they were healthy, maybe they would be.  Rivers is a phenomenal QB, they have great receivers, they really improved the o-line, who knows how good Gordon would look with a line, and some young developing talent on defense with old man Weddle holding the fort.

But now they're 2-7. everyone is injured, and the fans have to deal with the threat of the franchise being moved.
Well you are talking about the only team to be ranked #1 in overall Offense and Defense and still miss the playoffs. Though that season they also used 74 different players.  (55 man roster, 74 players used.  Let that sink in)
Time to raise a glass to my Charger bros. Our two seasons are like the east-west coast mirror of eachother; the crippling injuries, the lack of star talent around our qb atm, even how most of our losses are decided by less than a TD. 

We arent so different, you and I, so heres to the future! May we stare down the barrel of time with our heads held high and our chests pointed towards the rising sun, looking forward to the challanges that we might face!
[San Diego Defense](http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/team/_/stat/total/position/defense):

-Rush Yards: 26/32

-Per Game: 27/32

-Points Allowed : 27/32

**-Per Game: 29/32**

They're tied with Cleveland for third worst in the NFL with 27.7 points allowed per game. Only Detroit (29) and New Orleans (31.5) allow more. 

I feel like on almost any other team Rivers goes to the championship game at least.
Maybe Eli was right for avoiding that organization. Obviously on this side of things, you can't fault him for demanding a trade.
Bring back "Dr" Chao.

Weren't they number 1 in offensive and defense a few years ago but still managed a shit record?
You're telling me... It's ben rough watching the Chargers play.
I have always said Philip Rivers is the best QB from that draft. I don't give a shit who has more rings.
I personally think Phillip Rivers is one of the best QB's in the league and has been for a long time. 
I like how you say "throwing to TO and Jerry Rice" instead of Jeff Garcia...
I feel sorry for him. I have always enjoyed his play, he is one of my favorite QB's in the league.
My college team is NC State so I'm a huge Philip Rivers fan and it sucks that he's been so great and he'll most likely never win a super bowl unless he goes elsewhere which he won't do. Modern day Dan Marino.
I think Rivers is actually much better than we give him credit, and I know he's highly regarded.

I think Rivers has been making a pretty poorly ran team look far better than they deserve, and that he's saved countless coaching and front office jobs.

I think if he's with the Pats he has as many Superbowl rings as Tom Brady, and I'd say the same about him being on the Packers, Seahawks, and Giants. 

My only hope is that after the Chargers have completely failed him, that his children inherit his football ability, and after attending this Manning Quarterback Finishing School, that his 8 kids all start a reign of terror as they all play for competing teams that smash the Chargers over and over again.  

The  Philips name will live forever in the minds of Chargers fans as his oldest daughter becomes the first female QB in NFL history to pass for 500 yards against a team.  That team being her former fathers franchise.  




Cmon over to  ***PHIL***adelphia.
He's truly the Peyton Manning of his time. 
Chargers seem to be the only team I know of that are so good they are bad. I can't count the number of times they have done absolutely horrid the first half of the season only to win almost every single game in the last half. they either just miss the playoffs or they barely get in and lose 1st or 2nd round. 


They are like the Saints except they lost their only Super Bowl.
I just want to see Rivers on a really good team. He's been wasting away on that team for so long. They've had some good years but I want to see him on a consistently good team to see what he can do in the playoffs
Dude put up 500 fucking yards in a game. That's impressive as hell.
Reminds me of Archie Manning...
This doesn't take into account the changing of times...
t's less impressive when you put it in that perspective - BUT - he's playing very well and his team sucks.
&gt;Rivers is that good, and the team around him is that bad.

Just like his college years at NC State!  ;_;
Dan Marino...
Not looking at the story but I'm guessing the 49ers was Jeff Garcia. 
When romo gets his histo. Philip can come play some catch with DeZ. 
Yeah but what's his QBR /s
Don't be silly. The Chargers aren't bad whatsoever. The guys around Rivers aren't bad. They have a tough schedule and there wasn't ONE GAME where they just clearly were over-matched or simply not good enough. They were in EVERY GAME, losing by 7 or less points almost all the time. BARELY lost to the Bengals, BARELY lost to the Seahawks, BARELY lost to the Packers. They could be leading their division if they had a little bit more luck.
The Quarterback rating (QBR) is the dumbest stat that ESPN has ever cooked up. 3 weeks ago, when Drew Brees threw 8 TD passes against the Giants he was 9th that week among QBRs. Tom Brady won AFC offensive player of the week for the 22nd time in his career and he was 14th in QBR that week as well. Stupid.
Wait, they're 2-7?? I guess I just assumed they were doing abundantly average like always.
Rivers is the Tony Romo of the AFC. 
The Chargers always have weird stats like that. A few years ago they had the #1 ranked offense and #1 ranked defense but the worst special teams unit and didn't make the playoffs. 
To be fair, he doesn't put up these numbers on a better team. They have no run game and play from behind all the time, so he's always throwing. 
I have long respected Rivers and considered him a good Qb...Colts have struggled a lot v. the Chargers in the playoffs.
They've been decimated with injuries. Can this be due to conditioning or is it just bad luck?
So Jeff Garcia was the other QB?
At some point you have to look at the coach, GM and the training staff. The team has been one of the most inured teams every year since McCoy took over. It really is amazing the numbers Rivers puts up without any starters on the O'line and with his top 2 receivers injured.
[deleted]
Houston will take him!

They're also really damn injured. Didn't they have like 6 injuries in 1 game?
The perfect scenario for the Chargers to show up this week. It would be our luck, go out embarrass the Donkeys, proceed to lose by 20 to the Chargers the next week.
And one of those wins was against the Lions.
In Rivers we trust.....
Yeah, but he put up 99 of that QB rating against the Packers. 

That's how QB rating works.... right guys?
Go us!
A 100 QBR doesn't mean what it used to.  There are currently 7 starters in the league over 100, and most of the other starting quarterbacks are high 90s.
Poor guy, such wasted talent and potential.
As bad as they are this year, the AFC West will probably be wide open next year.  Rivers has been really, really good this year.  And he deserves credit where credit is due.
I hate how this tries to make out QB rating to be based only on the QB, apart from sacks it is a measurement of the entire passing offense.
Gates, Green, Allen, Floyd are all either injured or are coming off of very recent injuries.

That's 4 of their most highly targeted offense. And that's only the O list. Rabbit hole gets deeper with D roster.

Every time I pout about Cruz not being with us, I am quickly reminded of how bad SD has it right now.
Fuck, I feel for Rivers, he needs to get that supporting cast.
In other News, water is wet...

I am not piling on. I swear, but Rivers is "Fouts 2.0".  

what about the strange arm motion thought
came to this thread too late.

I can't say I'll be a Chargers fan much longer with the impending move and all.. but I'll forever be a Rivers fan.

I hope we start a new team in San Diego... let's call it the San Diego Rivers.
So I watched the Steelers game, in which he played great in the second half to lead his team back to just close enough, and then made a terrible play (not a pick) on 4th down in the other team's redzone when he had a chance to score at the end of the game.  Seems like he puts up good numbers but doesn't come through when it counts really.
Philip Rivers does not deserve to put up with this shit. It hurts my heart to see that man stuck on that football team. 
That's nice. Buuuuuuut glad Giants still made the trade.
I loved Jeff garcia
I really believe that if he woukd have stayed with the Giants he would have more SBs than Manning, maybe even Roethlisberger. 


There was a reason Eli refused to play for SD. 

I'm a 49ers and I can say fuck AJ Smith
last year in the super bowl, if rivers threw that pick instead of Wilson,  no one would be shocked.  that's the difference.

~~Not to rain on anyone's parade but the horrible defense is helping him here with the stats. It's a lot easier to throw in garbage time than it it is in crunch time~~

If this was Tony Romo though .....he's just a choker who can't win "big" games. 
One day, maybe in ten years or so, people will realize that Rivers is just a "Good" QB.  Stat machine, I guess you like that if you are a fantasy football guy, but never a real winner.  

In general the whole dynamic of the Chargers front office has been built around "stat" guys.  LaDainian Tomlinson, Gates, etc...   You have to be fully committed to win in the NFL.  They just were never that team. 

Did anyone really believe he would be hoisting a Lombardi Trophy?
Or maybe his attitude makes everyone around him worse?

People always talk about the "winning aura" the greats give off like Tom Brady. If you watch Philip Rivers between plays, he gives off the "whining aura".
And people questioned why Eli wanted out...
Thanks OP!  That useless info brought a smile to my face.
Isn't over half their roster on IR? Horrible title, do some actually research. 
Not to take anything away from Rivers, but Mariota's having a very strong rookie season with a similar level of support in Tennessee. 96 QB rating, team is 2-8.
And we almost traded him away.
I remember Rivers looked like he was heading for scrapheap two or three seasons ago. Heck of a turnaround. 
His QB rating is inflated from the first couple weeks of stat padding. It's like teams were letting Rivers play a video game back there.

&gt;Rivers is that good

Really? So he's the 2nd best QB since the merger? That seems to be what the title implies.
I honestly haven't paid much attention to the Chargers in the past few years, since they haven't tended to be very good and they very rarely play my team. My impression from back when I saw them more (around 06-10) was that Rivers was a bit of a prick, mainly based on him trash talking, whining about plays, and just generally being a bit yelly. Recently I've heard a few interviews with him and people talking about him, and he seems to be a genuinely nice guy.

So Chargers/AFC West fans, has he grown up a bit, was I wrong about him before, or is he a bit of a prick?
Is he really THAT good? I think Rivers is good, don't get me wrong, but he has put up a ton of garbage points/yards late in the game when things were kind of already settled from what I gathered. Things like that will artificially boost a QBs passer rating. Jay Cutler did it a lot last year.
Tony Romo &gt; Philip Rivers
The chargers should trade rivers to the broncos next year
I'm glad that Rivers will never win a Super Bowl unless he is holding a clipboard on another team.
Just find a way to give him to Philly so Rios and replace Sanchez, and then split the Super bowl rings between the two teams.
King of garbage time!
Why would he ever sign that extension? 
I have no sympathy for Phillip Rivers. He doesn't have to stay there for that shit. Pull a Carson Palmer, "retire" then come back and play for a different team.

Edit: down votes but no rebuttals? Lame-os
Yes,  because garbage time stats totally reveal how good a QB is. 
I wouldnt mind more internet streaming. That yahoo stream was cool with me. 
Yahoo stream was dope. I hope this becomes a big thing for the league.
As long as I can watch every Thursday Night Game without having to pay more money I'm fine with it. Whatever.

^*Alex ^Smith ^is ^the ^kindest, ^bravest, ^warmest, ^most ^wonderful ^human ^being ^I've ^ever ^known ^in ^my ^life.*
I'd like it if they showed it on CBS all season instead of just the first half.
It'd be cool if you could stream any NFL game you want via the internet, just like every other major sports league that has joined us in the 2010's. It's quite surprising that the MLB, which historically has been a grumpy old progress-hating league, is miles ahead in terms of accessibility via the internet.
That'd be awesome. Anything to get more competent providers streaming games.

I bought Directv's Sunday Ticket streaming-only options this year, and the quality is an absolute joke. I'd love to have an option to buy that from a competent provider.
I'd like this.  The NFL Network only thing sucks.  I don't have cable because it's not worth the price, so I would have to watch some stream from sites I don't really trust on Thursdays to watch the game.  Put it on Yahoo! and I'll watch.
Ha! My friend who works at Youtube said he saw him yesterday!

He said Goodell wasn't as big in person as he thought he would be.
How about moving it back to public access TV you greedy fucks?
60fps second streams next year please.
[deleted]
Now if only they showed games worth watching on Thursday night.
Excellent idea if it encompasses the whole season. 

Illegal NFL streams are decent but keep disconnecting because of legal threats. I'm not against streaming per se but I'd prefer legal streams than some shoddy pirated stream which gets taken down by lawyers. Seriously I can't watch anything for over 30 minutes without it being taken down. 
Just do away with Thursday night football as a whole!
I really liked the Yahoo streaming. Made sitting in the airport early on a Sunday morning for a flight bearable.
It isn't helping them by putting it only on NFL Network. I don't imagine many people who don't already have it upgrading to a package just to watch one game per week. I would rather stream it illegally, and make sure they don't make money off of it. It's a filthy scam.
I think it'd be a pretty bone-headed move by the NFL to NOT move in this direction. I can count on one hand all the people I know under 30 who still pay for cable, and it's only becoming less attractive.
Could you imagine if Yahoo were reborn as the dominant sports streaming provider?  How is Google letting Yahoo come back to life with this?  Google should be all over this.
Pied piper is gonna make some big money if this happens
Dan Wetzel: Hey, mister, I don't mean to tell tales out of school, 
but there's a fella in there'll pay you $10 if you blog into his WordPress. 

Goodell: I'm not hear to make a blog, you dumb cracker. 
They broadcast my games on the InterWebs. 

Joe Browne: That's Commissioner Roger "Pappy" Goodell. 
He'd sure like it if you watched his games and ignored those pesky concussions and domestic abusers! 

Browne: Ain't you gonna press the flesh, Pappy? 

Goodell: I'll press your flesh, you dim-witted son'bitch. 
Don't tell me how to court the Innernets. We ain't one-at-a-timin'. We're mass communicatin'! 

Browne: Oh, yes, that's a powerful new force. 

Goodell: Shake a leg, Junior. 


Bring it on, baby!
I think they should do it with the Sunday Morning games, but that might mess with the TV contracts.
I have a feeling he's going to want them to charge the viewers...
I want Sunday Ticket Streaming.
Yes please, I can finally watch a Thursday night game!
Or as I like to call it: The beginning of the end for my cable subscription.
I've watched some live concerts via Yahoo,and those were pretty awesome.

I am a cord cutter and I watch the NFL via streaming as it is.Please make this happen.
I will take everything back that I've said about yahoo and others.
I feel like I was the only one who had a bad time with the stream. I was at my friend's place. They have a commercial connection since two of his roommates work from home and the quality kept dipping to 480p. 
And then he's gonna fine someone right?
That stream was the shit, 11/10 would watch again
Stream it all, fuckface
To meet Yahoo and his other Yahoos
Bars everywhere are going to contacting their AV guys to figure out how show this.  AV techs rejoice!
All I really want is to be able to subscribe to one teams games for online streaming and not have to get DirecTV and pay for every team. It's so expensive to be out of town fan and be able to watch all your teams games. 
Good. We stream the NFL network only games for free anyways.
So this sounds like Thursday night football is here to stay. Once again, player safety takes a backseat to money.
Yahoo! More streaming of the NFL.......

*I'llshowmyselfout*
Yahoo + Verizon = horrible stream.  It was like watching a video in 1996 on real player.  Verizon probably degraded it on purpose.
Why do they have to partner with anyone? They have a perfectly fine streaming service already. Just allow us access!
I wish the NFL would cut the cord already. Stream games a la carte. I would gladly pay to stream the individual games that I want to see rather than having to sign a two year contract with DTV or go out to a bar. 
Give a tech company a tech job, and they do well. who knew? Don't screw it up, Rog.
I just like the option of being able to watch. I don't need to see every game, I just like to have options.
How come free streams like that League of Legends one works 10x better than my $150 Game Pass? Honest question. Is it traffic or something?
This could be the shot in the arm for Yahoo if they do it right. 

Sadly, Marissa Mayer's track record is spotty to say the least. 
yes, please 
I already get stream on my verizon phone.
Why not stream all the games at a decent price? You could even double dip advertisers for online streaming ads
I would love this.  Especially if they do it in time for tomorrow night's game.
While we are still far away from it, this is good news for potentially having live sports in 4K down the line. 

You still need the cameras and bandwidth, but I feel like live streams of 4K will come way before cable TV gets it. 
This is would be a really neat move, considering of how successful it went when they streamed the Bills/Jags game online.
Oh?   You mean no one is subscribing to your shitty premium network and no one is watching your Thursday night games?

I'm all for internet streaming, but can you pick something other than yahoo. 
I LOVE INNOVATION. 

I know this isn't innovative in the technological sense, but using it on such a large scale without restriction IS innovative. 
I loved the steam via my Roku 3, but I missed having the 5.1 audio that I get from the CBS and FOX over-the-air broadcasts. Maybe that will change when online game streaming becomes a regular thing.
Maybe Yahoo finally found a profitable business to enter after 15 years....
Yes yes yes. Just make Thursday night free please. They are the most sloppiest games anyway.
I think that eventually most sports will do something like this.

Some day the NFL will realize that there is a lot to be gained by offering a team-specific season streaming package as an alternative to the ungodly expensive All-32 Sunday Ticket.

A lot of fans see the value in paying a few hundred bucks to get every game. Many more couldn't care less about the thirty teams that are not a) their team or b) their team's opponent.
As long as they keep it mostly the way it is then I'm all for it. I could see in the future, they try to require log ins or creating accounts n all that BS. As long as they keep it easy to use I'll support it 
They need to talk about moving it to Tuesday. 
Cool, let's see why r/NFL is still going to shit on Goodell over this...
Thursdays were great the first half of the season. the work week was coming to an end and you look forward to TNF, it's almost a pre-start to the weekend. Now i say this because I don't have NFLN - so now it's just another day
Just stream all of your games.
"over-the-top"?
So, is it ok to like Goodell in this case?
Sorry Roger that Comcast data cap make streaming your football games impossible for me
Now if I could only afford the comcast overage charges I'd be set.
There was a huge problem with subtitles for me. I was unable to read anything due to the way they kept moving the text bubbles upwards.
How does a person without a computer or an Xbox watch this without having to see the whole thing on their tiny iPhone 4? I couldn't get it to work on my PlayStation.

:/
If i could pay a fee (free would be better) to stream the regular season. I totally would because i have no cable at home
Yahoo!
Goodell is an asshole, but he certainly knows how to make the NFL bigger. All the controversy has even helped. One of the biggest American sports stories after the Super Bowl and before the start of the season was the Brady deflagegate stuff. Not am I remotely saying it was intentional though.
I have been streaming football all season. Through Sunday ticket, watchESPN, and NBC Sports apps. The only issue I'm having is THF hasn't worked in the last 5 weeks or so. On my laptop, Xbox, or roku. It always says "unavailable"

Anyone else having this issue?
It would be great if I could somehow pay to watch any game digitally, regardless of whether it's on my local channels or not...
Better late than never I guess, but this really seems like the kind of thing that should have been done, like, five years ago. I think the only way they'll get people to give up their illegal streams is by making the Yahoo (and others) streams simple, very inexpensive and very high quality, or just straight up free. If, however, I end up having to change my cable package, the way that HBO does to subscribe to their HBOGo program, then I'll pass.
I hope ESPN talks to Yahoo to learn how to stream. Yahoo stream on Apple TV was flawless, any ESPN game - buffer, out of sync, loss of connection, have to back out, impossibly frustrating
I would rather be able to choose from any of the early Sunday games rather than have a stream of a game I already have access to. Just my opinion 
There shouldn't be much to talk about, just repeat Bills vs. Jags streaming service. I'm afraid the NFL will ruin this with greed so he less Goodell says the better.
I think I know what the next season of Silicon Valley is going to be focused on now 
This could be the start of something great 
I hope this works out. That yahoo stream of Jags vs Bills in London was magnificent.
Please no, that stream was awful and I don't want to hook my PC to my TV just to watch the game on a bigger screen. I must live in a area where yahoo don't have enough servers to handle the load.

I hope it would be TV and steam, TV is more reliable, you don't get any buffering.
I would LOVE this if it wasn't for my crappy ISP. If my Dad's watching it on his iPad, it overloads the network and the video will downsample. So really I love the NFL streams but hate the ISPs.
I would love the games streamed.  I'd pay to have a season pass with commercials if I could see the game.  Hell, I'm surprised they don't have an app where you buy a pass for the RedZone.
Thursday night football is a huge mistake.  The quality of the game suffers from not enough time for the players to recover from the previous week.
Why not talk about only playing on Thursdays after a bye first, Roger. Your product is shit.


CEOs at cable companies everywhere just started looking for new jobs. 
I vote for eliminating Thursday games altogether (except Thanksgiving).
Why? Is it because nobody fucking cares about the NFL Network?
Someone tell Rodger Goodell that TNF is fucking dogshit and should removed.
who seriously wants to watch a stream on a computer when you have a big screen HD TV? this is fucking assinine
Yes, please! NFL if you browse this sub, please take notice of how much we loved the stream. Make it happen!
See, guys? Goodell is a pretty great guy! 
Marissa Mayer so hot right now
No more Thursday games! 
I have read this title several times and each time my brain keeps seeing "Roger Goodell meets with Yoda &amp; others." It confuses the fuck out of me for a second every time.
Thursday football is stupid and jeopardizes player safety. That is all. 
Do us all a favor and just don't televise TNF. We see enough bad football as it is.
Can they also make it an hour earlier?
I don't like this. TNF is already played at a time where no other game is being shown on a channel most people already get. Being the only game on, I typically DVR and start watching about an hour after the game starts so I can fast forward through all the commercials and catch up by the end of the game, meaning I also won't see spoilers for any other game. I like the idea of streaming, but only if I can keep the same capabilities I currently have. I know most others probably don't do this, but it's my personal preference.
Talk about no more Thursday games instead.  Also, no more London.  

Not going to miss you, Roger.
All those commercials last night hyping Johnny Manziel for MNF just got a whole lot awkward.
HOW YOU GET FIRED ON YOUR DAY OFF?!? 
And Austin Davis is now the backup. Manziel to 3rd string.
Tickers for Browns v 49ers are $7.50 right now.
They didn't just bench Manziel.  He's been demoted to 3rd stringer and apparently Pettine is ready to cut him.  WTF is going on?
He's been busted back to 3rd string. Holy shit.
Johnny Football is like Slurms McKenzie. He will never stop partying.

&gt;JOHNNY MANZIEL, THIS THURSDAY ON NFL NETWORK

&gt;MANNING VS. BRADY NEXT WEEK ON NBC
Well McCown DID throw for approximately 8 million yards against us last time we played. 
LET THE MCCOWN V SCHAUB HYPE COMMENCE
Even on a bye week we lose.

Manziel after practice

http://i.imgur.com/e3iWiCt.gif
Damn, Wingo just said he was demoted to third QB when reading a statement from the Browns
This is probably an unpopular opinion, and I want Johnny to succeed more than anything, but I can understand the reasoning here. The team likely told him no partying, drinking, or doing anything that could get you in trouble/unnecessary attention. Johnny's obviously entitled to do what he wants in his free time, but it's all part of being held accountable. It doesn't have to do with the fact that he was partying, but the fact that he was almost surely told not to do it during the season and did it anyway. 

At the same time, I think Pettine is just trying to save his job, so who knows. 
More like Johnny Walker, am I right?! 
Man. Reddit is pretty divided over this. Each comment chain flips back and forth between "Come on, let him have a day off" to "He just got back from Rehab" to "we don't know what for" to "well he still shouldn't be drinking".

I'm not taking a side on this, I don't have all the facts. But Johnny knows the spotlight is always on him and he should be very cautious of what he does. But if this video is from months ago, Pettine is an asshole and clearly is done with him and was looking for anything to bench him.  
JFF:  Let me save you, dude.  Here's what you do.  Go to practice.  Work hard.  Come home, eat dinner, bang girlfriend, then play Xbox or read comic books until it's time to go to sleep.  The next day, repeat.

On game day:  Play hard. Go out with the team and have a glass of sparkling apple cider.  Go home.  Bang girlfriend, then play Xbox or read comic books or whatever until t's time to go to sleep.  

That's it. That's the entire plan.

If you follow my plan, when you are 33 years old you will have $100 million in the bank, the respect of America, a healthy body and mind, an epic gamerscore, and a satisfied girlfriend.
You can't really fault Johnny Manziel. Getting drafted by the Browns is just as difficult an affliction as alcoholism.
I was really looking forward to Johnny starting this week, crush the devastated ravens team, build his confidence as a starter.... Browns dreams never come true :(
more like jonny foolball am i right fellas
Johnny will be playing for the cowboys next year i guarantee it. I'll be surprised if hes on the team still at the end of the year. I've been a Johnny fanboy since we drafted him but i just don't know anymore.
Unreal.  

Send Johnny here.

Hey guys.  Remember all those times you \#lolbrownsed at us and we got real mad about it?

I'd like to apologize for that.  We deserve it.
I hate football.
We can't even beat bye week.
Lost among all of this is how many NFL execs are going to commit suicide at the news that Matt Schaub is going to lead the 3-7 Ravens against McCown and the 2-8 Browns in Cleveland on MNF.
 http://i.imgur.com/CPXTIfz.jpg 
They should let Johnny play,  but make him play drunk.  That would be way more entertaining than their current situation. 
WE ARE A DUMPSTER FIRE AGAIN BOYS. FIRST 9 GAMES OF LAST SEASON WERE FUN WHILE THEY LASTED. FIRE EVERYONEEEEEEE
They just need to let Johnny be Johnny:  
http://i.imgur.com/WU8sajQ.jpg
I'd imagine that just about means he's done in Cleveland. If they don't even give him the benefit of the doubt to see if him partying during the bye week would even diminish his play, I doubt they'll want to play him anymore unless they have to
What a joke. I was actually excited for Mondays game until this.
That Monday game is sure to bring in a lot of casual fans. Who could resist McCown vs Schaub?
The Browns lost on a bye week.
COWBOYS MANZIEL WHERE 
I'd say that, in conjunction with the evidence in the other thread, confirms that this incident happened this past weekend.

I don't feel bad for him, though. It's like Josh Gordon. Both should have known better.

You can't keep making the same mistakes and expect second/third/fourth chances.
BROWNS SUCK. OHIO STATE LOSES TO MICH STATE. CAVS WILL LOSE TO WARRIORS AGAIN. LOLHIO.

FUCK.
I'm not saying Manziel hasn't done some things to hurt up his chances in the NFL, but good Christ did he also fuck Pettine's wife or something?
Would be nice if the Chiefs got him. Andy loves bringing in troubled guys and help them rediscover football and improve their game. Play behind Alex for a while , get away from Cleveland and get a fresh start 
Overall, another status quo year for the Browns.  Some qb controversy, coach and front office disagreements, substance abuae, rehab, losing, and drinking by players and fans. Who needs a dramatic movie about the Brown's when the real life thing is better. It all makes me sad. 
Johnny must not have heard Pettine say "no partying" because he had too much fucking money in his ears. 
That's just stupid. I get that he's had some kind of addiction in the past, but all he did was drink during his week off. He wasn't seen passed out or drunk, he didn't start a fight or get involved with the police. It was just a night out on his weekend off. Pettine is benching he's best chances at a win for a guy drinking on he's week off.
Well there goes the idea of seeing what we have in this guy. He will be cut or traded this off season and it will be yet another blown pic. Thanks a lot. Fuck fuck fuck. I wish I wasn't a Browns fan. 
Bye bye Mike Pettine.
I hope he gets cut, so he can actually go somewhere where the coach doesnt hate him
People have this belief that Manziel is supposed to be like any other 22 year old.  He's not,  not even close.  The guy is supposed to be the face of a multi hundred million dollar franchise.  He's not supposed to be just like you. 
For anyone watching at home, THIS is how you lose the Bye Week.
Yes, let's bench the guy that put up 350 yards in his last game. 

BECAUSE, FUCK IT, THAT'S WHY.
Manziel not playing is what the terrorists want.
This is why you should never trust a bald guy with a goatee. Applies to all aspects of life too, not just football.
I've seen lemonade stands managed better than what the Browns are doing. 
Johnny could have drank eggnog and Pettine would have found an excuse to bench him. 
I am completely in favor with this. If that video really is from this past week (which I assume now it is) this makes complete sense. Johnny, you are not above the team or above the rules given to you. Grow up

I wanted to see him play the rest of the year and I'm disappointed in Johnny that he couldn't stay out of the negative spotlight for a week and get that chance. This guy is constantly in the spotlight for the wrong reasons, this is a solid decision and it sends a message to the team. 
ESPN is fucking pissed right now I bet. All their ads were basically showing Manziel. That's all they had to work with now that Flacco is out for the season.
We can't wait to have Johnny Football in Dallas!!!! 
only the browns lose thier starting QB during the bye week
MONDAY MONDAY MONDAY HIGH POWERED SHOWDOWN BETWEEN MATT SCHAUB AND JOSH MCCOWN YOU DONT WANT TO MISS IT!
This is why the Browns will always be terrible. They're having a losing season - play Manziel! Get him experience! Instead they bench him and start 36 year old McCown. Pretty short sighted if you ask me.
Benched from a 17 second TMZ Video? Wow. Johnny dug his own grave by checking himself into rehab in the first place.
...And the brown remains unchanged
the winds of shit is strong in cleveland
ESPN is like the biggest Manziel Troll. Shit's so annoying, can't go a week without hearing about him.
Welp, there goes the #1 pick.
It's normally an overreaction to say "I hate everything" But I do. I really hate everything.

I hate Manziel for deciding the bottle was more important than his career and his team.

I hate Pettine and the rest of the coaching staff for squandering all the progress and momentum from last year.

I hate Farmer for missing blatantly obvious picks and strategies to further his own school of thought, which has set the franchise back by years. Again.
 
I hate Haslam the con artist who doesn't give a shit about the Browns beyond the money. He scammed truck drivers he is scamming us.

I hate Goodell for being an inept flunkie that has made Football a TMZ sideshow and less of a legitimate sport.

I hate the NFL for refusing to take action as players shorten their lives for each hit they take on Sunday while the world watches. 

Ugh. Starting to think It might be time to move on completely. 
So he was partying during the bye week?
Most of the comments here revolve around whether or not he has a drinking problem, or whether it's okay for an NFL player to get drunk and party during the season... That's not the point. The point is that if your coach gives you a simple instruction to not do something, and you do it, there are consequences. 

Yeah, most players would not get benched for going out drinking on a bye week. Most players also haven't been told by their coach that they are explicitly forbidden from doing so, as it is rumored that Pettine did to Manziel. If he can't/refuses to follow a clear rule set by his coach, he doesn't have the discipline to lead an NFL team. Even if you think the rule was unfair, no NFL player can just ignore what their coaches tell them and expect to play.
It's not like he beat his wife or anything 
Come home baby
Yeah Johnny got caught drinking. But im sure he also got caught walking down the street, buying a burrito, and looking at some birds. 

Point is the kid always has a camera on him way more so than any 22 year old professional athlete. C'mon man. 
This is no more than Pettine desperately trying to save a job he should have already lost by shifting the focus to Manziel. Guy is a complete joke as a head coach.
Management on that team is a joke
The second this story popped up yesterday I'm sure Pettine got a big hard rubbery one so he could do this with a primetime game next on the schedule. It seems like he's had it out for him since draft day. Some of that is deserved after the shit last years but this team is fucking rudderless ship and I'm only looking forward to Mondays game cause I enjoy watching things crash into mountains. 
Nothing like a quarterback controversy to cover up the front office shenanigans. The organization as a whole is laughable. I'm beyond losing hope, I actually look forward to watching how many ways we can lose games. 
This team is the biggest shit show in the NFL. 
What's the big fucking deal? He was partying at a club and nothing of him doing anything illegal came out. You pay the man, so play the man!
#***Breaking:***

Nobody is going to watch Monday Night Football next week.
I didn't realize that a person drinking when they aren't on the job offended so many people
Off the bench, and then back again..

Will we ever see him be a consistent starting quarterback ever? I was so excited to see him get his shot at being big-play Johnny but he keeps falling back again and again.
With this kind of punishment ya gotta wonder if he flunked a piss test too. 
Johnny Football got filmed by Vinnie Video and is expected to meet Richie Rehab while Lenny Lawyer works out the details, as reported by Sammy Sportscaster.
Lions fans, are you accepting refugees? I might seek a temporary new home until this all blows over.

And is okay if I kinda like the Packers (close friend is a fan) but really hate the Vikings (because Teddy)?
I was already dreading watching the team this year. I was thinking "Okay, the bye week, and then the Monday night game - that means I have two Sundays in a row I can watch football without having to endure the Browns, yay"

And the only thing that had the potential to be worth watching was the development of Manziel. Now there is literally no positive reason whatsoever to watch the team. A 2-8 team starting a 36 year old journeyman starter for no fucking reason while they head for a top-3 pick without finding out if their young QB can hack it. What did Browns fans do to deserve this?
Should just have a practice team lineman follow him around and smack him in the face when he's about to do something dumb.
I'd rather have the Browns just cut him at this point. That way he can go to a team where he'd actually have a chance at succeeding because theres no way he's gonna work out in Cleveland at this point. Get it done Cleveland
Browns are a fucking joke. Does Pettine secretly have dick suckin lips? How did he even get hired?
This is so fucking stupid 
Hey Baltimore, want another team?
He is either very dumb or very weak.  Possibly both.
Isn't this the media circus they signed up for when they drafted him?
Could you imagine this story being brought to the attention of an nba front office. " Uhh hey its TMZ we have video of your star player drinking at a club.. Hello?....Hello?"
Yet another reason on a long list of reasons why the Browns fail every year. 

Please trade him for pennies to the Cowboys so he can hold a clipboard and learn from romo for 3 years.
Johnny needs to get his shit together. 

He just blew a golden opportunity.
Dumb. Pettine should be fired in my opinion. 
I hope Johnny gets cut, he deserves a shot with a team that has a competent coach.

Dude just threw for 370 yards last game he played.

Ok. Why? What is so wrong with going to a party? It's the fucking bye week and he can't go to a party? And you can't say it means he isn't taking his job seriously, because you can still have fun while taking your job seriously. This is ridiculous. Manziel has even been playing decently well. He's getting shit on by the Browns right now. 
Pettine is an idiot. Teams need stability at QB. 
Gary Barnidge fantasy owners everywhere rejoice
How can you bench someone for partying? Idiotic.
Really don't get it. Who cares what he does off field if not getting in trouble? 
Get caught in a possible domestic violence incident? You're our starter!  Get caught drinking on the bye week?  You're benched! 
I've never been a huge Manziel supporter since we drafted him, but I think this is a huge overreaction on Pettine's part. He's a 23 year old millionaire, who wen't out on his week off and had some fun. He didn't do drugs, didn't fight anyone, didn't make an ass of himself, and I'll guarantee there were players on the roster that went out and did the same god damn thing.  I'm so sick and tired of this fucking franchise and their inability to provide any measure of stability. I'm curious as to what Johnny would look like with a full 16 game season under his belt, but I doubt we'll ever see it. I just want to see what he's truly made of. McCown is not the future of this franchise, and I don't think Manziel is either, but at least give him a damn chance instead of punishing him for something as dumb as this.

EDIT: words.
A MNF game for the ages
MCCOWN VS SCHAUB ON MONDAY NIGHT MAGGLE ITS GONNA BE A BALL GAME
Man, just when you think they have the fire contained to a dumpster someone throws a propane tank in. Browns (my second team) are finally coming to town in a couple of weeks, I got tickets, and was getting hyped for it. Go figure...
ESPN already changed their MNF advertisement to McCown hahahahahaha
Seems a little extreme.  I bet Pettine was so excited to bench him.  Seems to be his favorite thing to do.


This is so Cleveland Browns.  Well, I guess it's back to drafting another quarterback in the first round. 
People say he obviously isn't focusing on the game. How the hell do you figure that? He's been improving as he has had more playing time. So there goes that argument. Not to mention the fact that people are blindly agreeing with the decision of a head coach who routinely makes poor ones.
I want to see Johnny play. Not Josh McCown. That guy is going to die from his next concussion. 
Fucking trade him to the Rams already. Trade up to the first round to get him, and then you treat him like a child. He balled out last game and now he's third string?

Pettine is a moron.
The Browns are an embarassment.  Not Manziel.
Kinda glad because Mccown will torch us and give us another loss now
Idk what agreements the Browns and Manziel have made, but he didn't get in any trouble, he didn't make a scene. 

Sure, he has a history, but every time he goes out it's irresponsible? Is he supposed to be a hermit now? 

This is just such a cluster fuck, I can't wrap my head around it. 
Worst sports organization of all time. The kid went to a party. See ya later, pettine 
lol pettine is such an idiot. he wont be around for much longer anyways
Pettine is absolutely terrible and only cares about his own ass.

He will crash and burn and bring Johnny down with him.

How typical
That's incredible. Third string behind Austin "Literally who" Davis.

I think I'll take a 9 month break from football. At least there's the cavs...
This is why the Browns are a disaster franchise.  Bench a young player with a ton of potential for a guy you know is a career backup.  Way to plan for the future!  It's like the *want* to be bad forever
I don't get why he got benched. Yes he was drinking again and he did just get done rehab... But HE'S the one who put himself in rehab!  The team didn't and the league didn't. 


I mean benching him for relapsing is one thing ... If you, the keague, or the legal system wants him to do the rehab. But to bench him for a relapse when HE'S the one who decides to go to rehab is fucking absurd!  



Manzeil (and all future troubled dudes take note) would have been better to wait until someone mandated that he needed help. Because by choosing to go hinself he's being treated the exact same as a dude who has had multiple chances and continually fucks up instead of like a guy who (while having an admittedly asshat like personality) hasn't really done anything wrong except last year he was late for a pregame meeting in which he knew he wasn't even going to play ... Other than that he's got a technically stellar record as far as staying out of actually trouble .... Although I will admit he's a complete asshat. 


But he'd probably not have been suspended if he hadn't gone to rehab. So lesson kiddies: if you don't want to get suspended don't voluntarily go to rehab...wait for the shield, your team or the kaw to force you to go. Nice logic. 
It's blowing my mind how many people are defending Manzel. He was told not to be a distraction. He did exactly what became a distraction(and who knows what else had happened behind closed doors). He went into rehab for what was almost assuredly substance abuse, and whether that was for alcohol or not, you have to be completely ignorant about substance abuse to think it's okay to go out and party and drink after spending months in rehab.
#THIS SHIT  RIGHT HERE IS WHY THE BROWNS ALWAYS SUCK
FREE JOHNNY 
So this makes that mnf promo irrelevant huh 
Just absolutely astonishing how this team and it's members continue to shoot themselves in the foot.  I'd say just fire everybody and start over, but we've tried that a time or two as well.
The Browns are such a joke. Wow.
I know he has a history, but some of this has to be attributed to the media making a huge deal of everything. 10 years ago this would be a normal bye week night for almost any young player. 
Cleveland, remember when you drafted johnny and lebron came back and you were the center of the ESPN world for a moment?  Good times...
What he even do? He's like what 22? Big fucking deal let him party as long as he isn't running around Hardying any chicks he is good in my book.
Honestly, the response to this wouldn't be so vile if Pettine didn't OBVIOUSLY hate Manziel. From day 1 he has refused to compliment anything about Manziel. There's a difference between being a tough-love coach and being a jerk to your players. I would be more on board with this if Pettine wasn't so hard headed toward Manziel. No matter how much you dislike your 1st round pick at QB, you can't destroy him like Pettine has so far. Does/did Manziel have/has a problem? Yes. But Pettine is making everything so much worse than it needs to be.
I don't get this. So long as he doesn't break the law or hit women, and plays to his best ability, what's the issue?  1990s football player must be laughing 
Manziel is a fucking idiot. 
Guys, just cause you go to rehab doesn't mean you can't drink/party at all...plenty of ways to deal with your problems, cold turkey isn't the only one.
Pettine is a terrible coach. haha there's no reason Johnny should have to stay away from partying on the biweek. Plenty of athletes do it.  Browns have a bad GM and coach, both need to go.
Everyone: don't draft manziel.  
  
Cleveland: I'm gonna...
How many times does it need to be said that Manziel is a Leaf before people believe it? Hell, he specifically didn't even go that high in the draft because of it.
What a mess...
I think the NFL should make it so the Browns can only randomly pick their 1st rounder. This way, they at least have a shot of not fucking up the pick again and again.
The video is old fucking footage!! The DJ who filmed it even said so.

Why is this not getting mentioned more?!
Well next Monday's game just got super boring.
Lmao.
And a decent number of people making excuses for him.  Pathetic 
Lol wtf?
Johnny "Todd Marniovinch" Football 
Oh man that makes me sad. I just want Johnny to find some peace from all the controversies that constantly surround him, become a regular starter and develop into a successful player. I would have liked to see him do it on the Browns, too. But it's starting to look like it's not meant to happen on the Browns. If they see no other option but to send him away, so be it. Just please don't let it be the Cowboys...
I wonder if Browns trade Manziel to 49ers for Kapernick.
Crazy. I'd give anything to be in the position where I could be a starting QB.  Yet Johnny Football throws it all down the drain.
I was so disappointed in him for this. I can't hate on Pettine for putting his foot down though. He should feel lucky he still has a job.
Hooray, frat boy put in his place!!
What did he do this time? Can someone fill me in?
For those who don't want to go to TMZ, and since it seems nobody has posted these.

Football is dumb anyways...
The game this Monday may (will) go down as, quite possibly, the worst in Monday Night Football history. 

Has there ever been a matchup of two teams with records THIS horrific?
I wonder if ESPN has a back up commercial now for MNF. I'm pretty sure ESPN ran that Johnny Football MNF commercial at least 7-8 times last night. 
One thing I don't get - is it normal for most NFL players who go clubbing during the off-season to go out during their bye week, or is it something players wait until the offseason?

I just want to know if the partying itself is abnormal, or if this all revolves around his past and the additional restrictions that are placed on him because of it.
Damn... How quickly did all of this just go down?

I remember less than a week ago talking in a thread about how proud we were of Johnny. He really seemed like he had gotten his shit together. 

This sucks... regardless if it is his fault or not. He is going to wake up eventually and be really depressed about this. 
Hardy out, Manziel in. Somehow an upgrade.
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Jerry Jones hosted the party to sabotage Johnny's Cleveland career.  Johnny Football to Dallas confirmed.

Why bench him? Might actually get a good pick from the Jets if they offload him now.
Fucking idiot has a career of being a multi millionaire throwing a ball around. Do your job and stop being a little shit. Wake the fuck up. 
Well Romo is no longer the most scrutinized qb.  Grown man out drinking on his bye week apparently is a reason to lose a job.  I kind of think he is meaning to ~~play~~ drink himself out of Cleveland. 
What a shit show.
r/browns is a freaking war zone. 
He doesn't seem to be motivated to be a successful quarterback likely because he would be a millionaire even if he wasn't playing QB.  His work ethic has been questioned by numerous insiders. I think best thing for Cleveland to do is to cut him. Maybe he will have a come to Jesus moment and change his life and realize what he might be throwing away if he continues down this path. 
I think this is just another bad decision by him and it's showing he is not worthy of leading the team. Coach told him not to party during bye week after getting the starting job.

He knows he is going to be a target if he goes out into a croweded club. He wasn't trying to be low key. He was up on stage, rapping for the videotaker etc.

 I don't think its the drinking by itself. If he had gone to some hole in the wall bar in Cleveland and just sat around quietly in a booth there wouldn't have been the same reaction. It was essentially a big FU to the coach by putting himself out there in public and acting like that.
Remember when NFL players could do whatever the fuck they wanted with no consequences? Those were the days.
Fuck Mike Pettine.
A 21 year old that parties? Better bench the kid.
Only in the fucking NFL does this happen. 
Why do we still have the browns?  The NFL would be a better sport is the rosters were a little meatier.  Let's get rid of Cleveland and Tennessee.  
How does Pettine still have a job?
Mike Pettine is a fucking bitch
He hasn't hurt anyone, maybe he likes to party, oh well so did Ronaldinho, Michael Irven, and many other players. Let the man party, if he can throw the ball who cares? This league hops players up on horribly addictive pain killers but takes a stance on someone who drinks? What the fuck 
Manziel needs to go to a team that has a coach who doesn't hate him. 49ers maybe? Eagles? 
Stupid decision. If you keep doing the same stupidity every year you aren't going to progress. Just let manziel play, its not like he has committed some crime.
This is kind of crazy. Yea I know Manziel has a history but he didn't break the law, didn't get in trouble of any kind. 
I agree with Pettine. This is about a lack of responsibility and commitment to the team. His talent has carried him this far in life, but this is the NFL now and he needs work to be a franchise QB. If you promise to focus on the team only and then get caught doing the things you promised not to do, then move aside. There's a million football players behind you dying to get that shot at the NFL.
This thread is a great example of how far people will go to enable someone else's problems. Look at how much excuse making there is from people with little direct investment in Manziel. Now think of how much enabling he's getting in his life from people whose best interests are keeping him in party mode and hanging out with them. 
Let's all try to remember that this a league where Johnny Manziel can get cut for essentially nothing more than having fun with friends, while Greg Hardy can literally bear his girlfriend to a pulp and still play football because no one took a picture of him doing it.  This league is bullshit.
Pettine just wants to fuck with them on his way out.
Putting aside the fact that we don't know what Manziel officially went to rehab for, am I the only one of the opinion that rehab ‚â† completely abstaining from something?

Rehabilitation, in my mind, should focus on fixing a perceived issue. If that calls for total sobriety, so be it. But why can't it be seen as a tool to help learn how to, for example, drink in moderation as opposed to binge? There isn't an "end all, be all" fix or what have you for these kind of things, it depends on the individual and what kind of issues they are facing.

Regardless, if the team told him "absolutely no drinking" or whatever and he did, then there isn't much to be said. If that isn't the case though, they are out of line for punishing a kid who didn't break any rules.
Imagine for a moment you invest in someone with a known history of having a gambling problem. Now up front this is probably a bad decision on your end. But let's say you believe this person has reformed and they personally have given you assurances that they've changed and will stay away from gambling. So you take the risk and invest with this person. And then you find out they were at the racetrack. You speak with them and express your concerns. They apologize, provide more assurances and even go so far as to agree to attend therapy to treat their gambling problem. And then you find out that only a few months later they again have been hanging out at the racetrack. 

You've invested money with this person. You were previously worried that their negative personal behaviour was going to impact their professional behaviour.  They gave you assurances that they'd discontinue their negative personal behaviour and they then broke these assurances. You have a business decision to make‚Äîto cut your losses on the investment or to invest more. Given that context what does it matter that other people also go to the racetrack. How is that relevant to the business decision the Browns' have to make? 
How people can support this clown boggles my mind,  He's Tebow with a substance abuse problem.  College Star who rode the Infamy to an Undeserved 1st Round pick and turned out to be shitty. Only Difference seems to be Tebow at least attempts to be a decent Human being.
Here's my take.

I'm a member of the US Army. When I'm stateside (Think Manziel's offseason) I'm allowed to imbibe and enjoy myself at will.

When I'm deployed into combat (Think Manziel during the season) I have strict orders to *not* drink. 

So to protect what is important to me- Which is my family and my job, I respect that order. I do everything necessary to ensure I don't ruin the life I have made back home.

It really is **not that hard, Manziel.**

He has been asked time and time again. I feel sorry only for the ones close to him that have to deal with his blatant ignorance and immaturity.
I respect the Browns for handling this situation like this. Johnny had the keys to the drivers seat, they benched McCown to give Johnny a chance. Wish him the best, but the kids gotta grow up.
I personally think the Browns overreacted. Johnny was just having a good time. I'm an alcoholic myself so maybe I'm just a little bias.
He gets benched for doing something hundreds of players in the league do on their bye week? Pretty stupid imo.
Mike Pettine is literally wruining the Browns for me :(
This is why the Browns stay the Browns.
I pray he goes to the bills or jets and fucking lights it up. Browns are the mariners of football run by a bunch of dummies 
Turn back if you have an opinion.... Downvotes are crazy in here.
There are two ways you can go about your life after getting a reputation in college: the Jameis Winston way ie stay out of the headlines and focus on football,  or the Johnny Manziel way ie fuck whatever the headlines say, and keep doing what you're doing 
People seem to be having a serious problem with accountability. This isn't Pettine or the Browns faults. Johnny was told not to do something he has a history of, and he did it anyway. Stop treating him like he's above the law, he deserves to be benched, and if I was the Browns I'd bench his ass too. Accountability is extremely important in a winning culture.
Good. People often forget that football isn't a game at this level, it's a livelyhood. There are millions upon millions of dollars, people's jobs, people's fucking lives at stake here. This team hasn't pulled together a winning season yet and people's heads are on the chopping block every.single.game. This kid has been given second chances half of America would kill for and he just doesn't even give a flying fuck. Glad the coach has a pair big enough to do what's right for the team, it's a shame he might lose his job over it
Lol whoever said 3 teams in LA is trolling like mad.
Did age have any correlation with how many teams they wanted in LA?
Sample size:1000

Using Google survey and asked on subreddits of NFL teams as well as Facebook groups and pages, here's the link:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/18X-c0bqtQJr1AKgPLMeIlzDYjvE8Q_VKz5jVGx8kXYQ/viewform

I stopped counting answers right after getting the 1000th reply and avoided asking on /r/chargers and /r/oaklandraiders and  /r/stlouisrams to avoid getting skewed answers
How about team with worst record moves. Race to the bottom!
ITT: People that don't live in LA

I vote for "moving" all three

Los Angeles Raiders of Oakland

Los Angeles Chargers of San Diego

Los Angeles Rams of St. Louis
What made up the "Other"?
As a lifelong LA resident, it would just feel weird to have the Chargers here. Their one season in LA really doesn't count.
man, fuck NFL fans!  Just let us keep our shitty football team.
Of course, there are reliability problems with disseminating the survey only on Facebook and Reddit, namely that it skews the demographic responding to the survey.

Still, it's interesting and probably has more truth to it than ridiculousness.
Why does the NFL not work in LA? They can support a NHL franchise but not America's biggest sport? 
Zero

Because I like LA not having something, and I wish for it to continue.
Fuck everyone who said someone else's team should move 
Can we please move the seahawks to LA.
I almost exclusively see people wanting the rams to stay, especially here on reddit, and i get it. But damnit, I want the LA Rams back
Just let the nfl expand and keep the teams where they are, instead of pissing off one or more groups of people. 
If the Raiders move, do they have to refund the PSL money?
[deleted]
So funny story about this, I went to Mr. Submaine last night to get some food. I'm sitting in the drive through and notice a car with plates that say "LA Rams Fan" on an Illinois plate with a St. Louis Rams frame. 
Definitely don't move the Raiders, they're the closest team to  San Francisco!
They had two teams.  They had their chance.
Should LA have a team?

So on average, I'm older than about 2/3 of the sub.  That's nice to know next time people start making fun of the "new fans" of any team.
LA Golds?
What does the age stat represent? Total people polled or a specific question? 
If i ask nicely can the Rams stay in St. Louis? Please? :l
Did you think to maybe specifically target Los Angeles residents? I know that may have been hard to control for, but I think that's the population who's opinion matters the most since they'll be the most likely to support (or not support) the incoming team(s). 
The Rams, and the Rams only. They need a bigger following and increased attendance. I really don't understand why the Chargers want to go to LA.

 Though, I can also see the Raiders in LA too.
Who cares what people outside of California think?




I'd rather they fix their water problem before trying to attract more people there
I hate the Raiders and don't want my new home team being a division rival with my old home team. (even though it would mean getting to see at least one live game a year) 

So Chargers get my vote.
I'd be interested to know from where your respondents are from, specifically the LA area and those cities affected by teams which may move.
The L.A. Steelers     ...*shivers*
VERY well put together 
Please take the rams!
Did you use Piktochart?
Really cool graphic and info /u/qrhoo 

FWIW, Raiders make the most sense.  Not for business reasons or connection to the community or anything like it.  The Raiders should, nay, must move to Irwindale.  

Light the beacon!
I'd be curious if the survey was done only with people in and around the LA area which team would have the most votes
It would be interesting to see how people would answer "should LA get a team?"

I suspect less than 63% would say "yes".  One of the interesting things about survey taking is that the phrasing of the question can have a big effect.
Do you have your numbers in table format? Would love to feed these into Tableau and see what could be spun up.
I wish this place was around in 94 would have been great to see all the support since no one should lose their team, or would it be fuck LA as most people seem to say outside of the area.  
Even as a Brit I think it's disgusting that the league are willing to allow one city to lose it's team, while doing everything in their power to drum up support for a London team.
Why would you use a bar graph on the bottom data instead of a pie graph like all others?
This is one thing I really don't get with American sports.  How can you just move a team, like the Rams for instance, to a completely different state?  Do people in America not support the team where they live?  
If it happens, it should only be one team.

I can't say whose team it should be but the Rams seem likely, and LA Rams is already what I grew up with.
If its the Rams, they need to do a remake of RAM IT:

Move the Raiders to another hemisphere and call it a day.

The Rams and Raiders make sense. 

The Chargers are an interesting idea though...last time I heard, the city isn't really supporting the Chargers efforts on a new/updated stadium...
When I saw the raiders take it to the chargers and the stands were going crazy for the raiders, I was completely swayed that the chargers need to relocate. 
Rodger Goodell is that you?
Nearly a quarter don't want any team in LA. Such haters.
LA has had like three teams in the past I'm over LA
Raiders make more sense since there's many Raiders fans in LA already . 

Also, not the Rams because that's too many California teams already. 
everyone who voted Raiders is dumb.
Please take the Rams!
Makes no sense to move another team to Cali. If LA wants a team move a team already in Cali there. 
If LA gets a team it should only be one. LA has proven in the past that it can't support two teams so don't try and split the market. 
Do not submit this to /r/design. I appreciate the effort, but the presentation is so ugly.
Oh, and 0.0001% of users responded.  Fuck off.
I would say Oakland probably has the best idea with relocating, given Oakland's reputation.
I'm ready to be a Raiders fan. 
Who the hell said three teams? LA didn't care the last time they had one.
NFL does not work in LA, never has... 


I say zero
Online and non scientific polls give you zero data
Take the bills, pretty please.
I vote Anchorage, Alaska for the Raiders newest location.
How many voters have actually been to LA? It's all Raiders fans down there. The raiders would be moving into a city that's practically already (or should I say *still*) home.

That being said, any team of the three will likely last a decade at best. There's a lot of people there, but the LA market is weak, there's a reason there's no team there.
[I'm not colorblind.](http://i.imgur.com/QPxdGvz.gifv)
I feel like I'm watching football on Christmas day...
This is funny since the whole reason the NFL went with home and away jerseys was so that one team would be in white for black and white televisions.

&gt;White road uniforms gained prominence with the rise of television in the 1950s. A "white vs. color" game was easier to follow in black-and-white.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Away_colours#National_Football_League
I'm not colorblind at all, but I'm having trouble watching the game because it's on the NFL network....
[IDK the message seems quite clear](http://i.imgur.com/VZVO24m.jpg)

**Confession:** Am colorblind. Can't pick strawberries.

As a colorblind man, I'd just like to say‚Ä¶

THE BILLS' MAIN COLOR IS BLUE. WHAT THE FUCK, NFL.
I liked the internet way better before it became the customer service desk for the universe.
If I have to support the 8% of people using internet explorer as a browser, the NFL should have to support the 8% of colorblind people.
Here is a video to show what the game looks like to some colorblind:   http://deadspin.com/stupid-nike-uniforms-wreaking-havoc-on-colorblind-nfl-f-1742272136
I just went and showed the game to my dad.

 "What color are they?" 

"Uhh. Red."

"And the other one?"

"I don't know. Red?"
It would have been hilarious if Phil Simms was colorblind.
I'm colorblind and have no trouble seeing the differences in pictures (I'm not watching the game so haven't seen them in action, but I don't know if that's the case). My colorblindness is pretty, but not the most , severe type for red-green colorblindness...
Given that there are approximately 100 players between the two teams, statically there are a few players who can't distinguish the jerseys. I suppose not that big of a deal unless you're a QB.
The torture's a lot worse for those of us who are not colorblind.
I thought it was a nice catch at the end of the game, only to hear the announcer say its intercepted.
All of reddit are colorblind experts... That's amazing.
Can confirm, I have no idea what's going on.
Statistically speaking, there has to at least be a couple of players on that field that are having trouble distinguishing those jerseys from each other...
&lt;Colorblind people&gt; Man, we're having trouble distinguishing these uniforms.  
&lt;Non-colorblind Internet Nerds&gt; No you aren't, you lying shitlord.  This website I just read for the first time ever says you should be fine. 
["Do you have a color seeing-eye dog that can tell you what color things are?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRNKxAy049w)
And 100% of football fans are having a hard time watching the game because woweee what a shit storm this is.
I am the 8%!
I can't see shit. 
[deleted]
Damnit I was really hoping we would get more color vs color games. Back to white jerseys for the away team. 

I knew they were doing a test of colored jerseys this year but why did they lick the two colors most people have color with? Why not like cincys orange and black versus San diegos blue?
I love the color on color concept, but maybe those two colors weren't the best choice.
Had a friend that had trouble seeing them. Every time in Call of Duty when somebody called in a helicopter. "Is that our helicopter or theirs?"

They all have the option to change for colorblind though now. 
Myself included. It really distracted from the game at points.
It's also offensive to those of us who do not think football should be played in pajamas.
I always thought one team always has to wear a white Jersey 
I'm very colorblind, I can't pass the simplest color plates for red-green. Oddly enough, I had no trouble watching the game and distinguishing between the teams.

Hated the uniforms anyway though. It was like watching radioactive Santa's elves on steroids.
I find it hard to believe that 8% of men are colorblind.
A bunch of marios vs luigis
They were the lucky ones.  Only so much ugly a man can take.
Til I might be color blind. Fuck
I'm Green - Blue colorblind so I lucked out, but I knew I had a good reason to hate these unis.
God those uniforms are awful.
# #alleyesmatter 
When i read the title i was thinking how the other 92% of the colorblind men dont have a Problem with the monochromatic shirts
Game looks better in black and silver anyhow
Those reds are vibrant enough and the greens are dull enough that I have no issue with those jerseys.

But duller reds and greens and dark blues/purples and I have no idea what's going on. Also, I fail every single one of those "magic" posters (Can you read it? Can't you see the boat? Fuck you lot. All of you)
I was thinking that these uniforms/helmets with metallic paint were fucking awesome and all teams should wear them like that. The colors were so vivid and contrasting. I never thought about the poor colorblind :(
I am colorblind, however I still didn't have any problem watching the game. The colors were distinct enough for me to easily see the difference.
Jesus Christ.  Now we have to adhere to this shit
I'd say just look for the difference in QB, black or white, but I guess they don't see colors.
Did any of the players complain about getting confused?

Ryan Fitzpatrick had his worse completion percentage (44%) of the season...
as a colorblind guy, this was a very confusing game
I'm sure Goodell will get a pass for this one too.
colorblind here. It was unwatchable, but kind of entertaining not knowing what the fuck was going on.
who cares.... So there were literally dozens of people who had a hard time watching the game.
OMG. I was wondering what the hell my dad was talking about. He was complaining they used similar uniforms when they weren't even close. hahahahaha
My boss is color blind (he says he can see colors but not just gray colorblind). He told me that when he was watching the game he had no idea why everyone was wearing red and was bullshit. His wife had to tell him the Jets were in green. He couldn't tell the difference between the two besides logo and coupe only see the difference of the players arm color. He said fuck it and stopped watching. He said he wasn't gonna bother if he can't tell who is who
Cousin is colorblind and a Bills fan. He accidentally cheered for the Jets a couple times.
They looked like they were playing a very special Christmas game in their footie pajamas. I thought it was cute. 
Ok.
That's assuming 100% of the 8% of colorblind men watched the game.
It wasn't too bad at the start of the game, but once the jerseys became wet and darkened, I couldn't tell anymore. :(
Can anyone tell me what "Color Rush" is?  It seems only like another of Goodell's dumb marketing gimmicks.  At first I thought they were celebrating the Christmas season with red and green uniforms last night.
I mean, it was hard to watch for the non-colorblind fans too. Just awful.  
I mean, I'm one of them, but eh.   I'd be pissed as hell if that was how EVERY match was, but ffs, we'll live.
Which of the 8% of those men watch football?  
I had a hard time watching because it looked like grown men dressed up like eleven year-old boys at a sleepover.
My girlfriends brother was flipping out because of this lol 
You'd think the NFL would have realized this given the breast cancer awareness last month and salute to service this month.
Deuteranopia dude here. Aside from it being an AFC East game, it was pretty unbearable to watch. #AllEyesMatter
Damn you can't please everyone. Nothing against people who are colorblind but it's not like Nike and the nfl  were purposely trying to screw them over. I for one thought the uniforms looks pretty cool. 
Those poor colorblind people, missing out on the awful, garish uniforms.
Color rush is an ugly uniform design.
wtf is the point of these uniforms?
I was wondering why the game looked kind of screwy. 
Here here! 
I had a hard time watching the game because it was boring. 
Dogs are also red/green colorblind. Won't someone think of the puppies?!
SWAC tribute
can someone photoshop it so i can see what they (can't) see?
Can someone maybe show a gif of what a normal, color jersey v white jersey game looks to the colorblind?
Why were neither of them wearing their away uniforms? I thought this was one of the multiple stated reasons for even having white jerseys.
Hilarious.
I'm colorblind, but it must not be red green.

Are there other kinds of colorblindness cause I know that I struggle to see colors in colors a lot.
I just had to look up the percentage of women. 0.5% apprarently.
I'm colorblind but I was having a hard time watching the game because it was the Bills vs Jets

Also, the Bills jersey's looked like the Pats red throwbacks, they should have stuck with all blue combination.
My good friend and roommate is red green color blind. He was like what the fuck is this shit? They're wearing the same damn uniform. It took me a second to remember his condition. I thought people were paid think this kind of thing through. Jeez
I wish I'd had trouble seeing the 4th quarter.
if you think this week was an eyesore, maybe dont look at next weeks match up
It's one of those things where why its understandable how you would miss this...it makes no sense that someone whose job it is to pick colors doesn't know this.
Am I the only one who thought the unis were cool last night? 
Welcome to colorblind awareness month!
I must be color blind, I don't see any football teams on the field.
I am red-green colorblind and when I was watching highlights, I had to focus on the jersey numbers to know who each person was :/
All I could think about was:  WOLOLOLOLOLOL
I hard a had time watching for other reasons.:(
Must be hard for the color deaf as well :(
Woo! Colorblind but not the right kind! I can watch this awful game.
Did Boomer Edison announce on the radio?? Because I'm pretty sure he is actually colorblind
I'm having a much harder time watching the game as well since they switched it to the nfl network. 
Fwiw (cause I know y'all askin') RB colorblind here. No issues watching the game. However stills/pictures take a second or two to figure everything out. I thought I would love the Bills unis. They were "meh". Thought I'd hate the Jets unis. They were super sharp. 
Well that's what happens when you make a game the "ugly fucking christmas bowl"
I wonder how anyone survived before color TV.
Late to the party, but using a low-ball estimate for prevalence of red/green-colorblindness in males of 4% (p=0.04), and a roster size of 46 per team (n=92), there was a **97.6% chance that at least one suited-up player in the game was red-green colorblind.**

[binomial distribution with n=92, p=.04, x&gt;=1](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial+distribution+with+n%3D92%2C+p%3D.04%2C+x%3E%3D1)
I'm colorblind and I could easily tell the difference. So no. 
I'm assuming most colorblind people aren't as upset as the media is making them out to be.

I fully expect tomorrow to have a follow on report from the media how blind people have been having trouble watching any of the NFL since the very beginning of time.
    #ALLEYESMATTER
bills won
Any colorblind players in this game? If the 8% number is the same in the NFL, that would mean their are eight guys out there who have no idea what's going on out there.
welcome to America, what are we outraged by today?
Reminds me of christmas colors. Santa's Vs Elves
It's easy to tell, just look at who is miserably losing.
and 92% of us don't give a fuck so shut the fuck up about this already!
what about women, you shit lord? 

edit: male pigs downvoting me
I lasted 3 minutes of game time before I changed the channel. I would be livid if this was an Eagles game and not the Jets.

I really can't believe the NFL okayed this to happen and thought it was a good idea.

I'm not colorblind. But these shits are ugly.
Colorblind, but those particular shades are not effected. 
I'm not even colorblind and I had a hard time watching the game. These fruity uniforms fuckin suck shit
Call me a dick, but is it that hard to tell which players are running one way and which players are facing the other? There are a lot of screenshots in here but I'm sure video is much easier to distinguish.

Also, 8% of men have colorblindness and not all those men who are colorblind will have been watching the game. So why is it that big of a deal?

Edit: Found the video of what it looks like in video form to people who are colorblind. Didn't watch the game but identified the Bills scored on a fumble recovery without even knowing who started with the ball. It seems like a first world problem up in here. Like I know that it isn't fun to have the disability, but it is also dumb to make a big stink about it when it affects so little and really isn't that severe.
So should the NFL change the grass color as well??
People without eyes can't watch the game.
Seeing how ugly this game looks I think I'd rather be color blind. 
Why?
goodell is a joke.  when does he get fired already?

 #colorblindlivesmatter
Heavy sarcasm warning!

Color blindness is real and I think the NFL should pay part of my Direct TV bill for ignoring my condition. 

I didn't appreciate the attack on my vision and I think all uniforms should not be monochrome. I expect to hear an apology from Roger Goodell tomorrow morning and he should resign for allowing this to happen. If you had no problem watching the game, I don't want to hear it, your differing opinion will not be heard by me. It's my way or the highway. 

That's what I was taught growing up! Stomp my feet and scream until the world molds their life around my demands! The NFL needs to create a safe space for my vision.
Stop the world... 4.34% of people who could be watching can't tell which team is which.
Oh noes 8 percent! Stop the presses!
There'd be an outrage if they did something that affected this many women...
I don't care
We get it
So like 1,ooo guys were inconvenienced?  Better tailor every game to every group 
Boo Hoo?
The color blind are lucky, both uniforms look like shit.
Can someone grey out each uniform and the field to see what they see?
As a non-colorblind Pats fan, I envy all those who can't distinguish between these plebs tonight. 
This tweet entirely misuses the figure it quotes. I [commented on that earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3slztd/jets_and_bills_play_in_monochromatic_greenred/cwyfp4d), but a lot of people seem to be overlooking this point, so I'm reposting as a top-level comment. The key point that both the tweet and most of the people posting in this thread are overlooking is that **"color-blindness", and even "red-green color-blindness" refer to a range of conditions with widely differing practical effects, only the rarer of which affect people's ability to distinguish the colors in this game.**

In my original comment, I thought that only deuteranopia would, but from [Napoleon Bonerparts post in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3slztd/jets_and_bills_play_in_monochromatic_greenred/cwyfsl1), it seems that protanopia does as well. Either way, the estimated prevalence of both conditions combined among the male (Northern-European descended) community, *per* [the article OP links to in this thread](https://nei.nih.gov/health/color_blindness/facts_about) is no more than 2%. The remaining 6% of males referred to as "red-green colorblind" are **prot/deuteranomalous‚Äîfar milder conditions** that for the most part have not the least practical effect on the appearance of this game.

So yes, some people have colorblindness that hampers their ability to follow this game, including the OPs of this thread and the tweet. Yes, it's an issue worth raising. But **the relevant figure here is 2%, not 8%**. It's as simple as that.

Edit: I really wish the people downvoting these comments would explain their rationales, because as far as I can see, I'm pointing out a clear factual error in the OP that is relevant to the broader discussion.
Not only do colorblind people have no idea what the fuck is going on, but the uniforms just look terrible in general. Can we please just keep it where one team wears white, the other wears color?
Get better eyes I guess !!
Why don't they just change all the stoplights, then?
I came home after work this morning, fired up my Apple TV, NFL Gamepass, Bills-Jets condensed game... nope. My eyes just tapped out after 3 minutes into the game. Thank god I didn't even want to watch that game, I despise both teams and I don't even know why.
Thee wa that one play in the end zone in the first half that I was like who the fuck is He throwing to??? It look like there were 5 bills and no jets there   I could not tell who was who when te camera was zoomed out 
K
I thought it looked cool and I think more teams should try this. Sorry, colorblind people. 
Except that red/green colorblind men should be able to distinguish these uniforms just fine.

It's easy to check this for yourself at http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/

Save the pic of the Jets and Bills color rush unis from the tweet the title of this thread links to. Go to to the URL above and upload the picture. It lets you see what the Jets and Bills unis look like to people with various kinds of colorblindness. In each case, the unis are VERY distinct from each other except for for people who have "monochromacy"-- which is a rare condition that only 1 in 40,000 people have.
he's the new Danny Amendola!
Those horns are going to look massive on his space helmet
Please don't die.
I love that there was an article yesterday which said Wes Welker was still unsigned and he immediately gets signed. I feel like the Rams were like "oh yeah, he's still alive."
Why didn't the Ravens try to get him? They don't have anybody good now that Steve Smith is out
Good thing the NFC West defenses are so easy on wide receivers
Welker was quoted as saying, "I'm excited to join Kurt Warner and the Greatest Show on Turf."
Move over Peyton, there's a new favorite for on field death this year.
After watching the Rams do fairly well against us just running Tavon one way and Gurley the other, adding Welker in the flat would be brilliantly effective I think. 
What? Why? Are the rams short on receivers?
"I'm so excited to sign with the Rams, I can't wait to play with Marc Bulger!"

-Wes Welker
Go easy on him in practice Gregg
I hope he stays healthy.  I'm still a big Welker fan and he's the kind of safety net that a QB can really lean on.  
God dammit, Wes. I love yah but you're gonna get yourself killed.  
Time for everyone to rip on him until he does well and everyone says they are so proud of him for fighting through adversity 
good luck and god bless
This can only end poorly. He'll be covered by Kam, Tartt, and Bucannon in the NFCW... he's gonna die.
Almost 2 years ago, the week before the Super Bowl I was talking shit about the Broncos to some co-workers. One ended up being Welkers brother.
Good for him. One of my favorite players ever. Take care of him Rams.
Well, at least we signed someone we know that can catch a fucking ball.

Welcome to St. Louis, Wes.
Fuck yeah!!! We haven't had a WR (outside of Tavon "gadget" Austin) since GSOT!

Go Rams!!!
One of the best receivers ever joining the Rams is always a cool thing, even at this point in his career
tomorrows headlines "Wes Welker suffers concussion from slipping on cement near field." 
I for one hope he does well 
I always figured the Cowboys would sign him when Dez got hurt and before Romo went down. 

It makes sense that he went with the Rams, though.

Their WR's are 24, 24, 22, 27, 24, and 26 years old. Bradley Marquez is the 22 yr old rookie from Texas Tech as well. He is 10 years older than most of the receivers and will be able to coach/play at the same time. 
One more bell-ringin' and they'll basically be starting Terri Schiavo at WR.
From Chargers, to Dolphins, to Patriots, to Broncos, to Rams. Such a viscous cycle.
here come the armchair neuroscientists 
 I AM SO PROUD TO BE SIGNED TO TEH TORONTO ASTRONAUTS I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE PLAYING HERE IN MILUWAKEE


THANK YOU GOD BLESS,

WES WELKER
Finally I can rename my fantasy team the White Welkers again
But, but reddit told him to retire!
God dammit St. Louis... This poor man has nothing else to give. You're gonna kill him.
Playing for a team whose mascot is literally an animal that attacks by smashing its head against things. Seems like a bad omen.
I hope he can perform well without any more head injuries. Guy deserves to go out on a good note. 
I love Wes and am grateful for his play in Denver, but can this honestly be anything but bad for his health? I get that it's his decision, but man I hope nothing tragic happens. 
Awesome, good for him.
Thanks Mr Fisher
Well, you know that question that comes up here every so often -- "What's going to happen when a player actually dies on the field?" -- we might finally find out the answer this season.
One of my favorite players. Wish him a safe season and hopefully he makes some big plays during the season and post season.
For a forum that prides itself on taking head injuries seriously, there are a lot of jokes in this thread.

Good for Wes. Hopefully he can contribute.
Damn it Wes. Get some cushy TV job or something. Is permanent brain damage worth it? 
Well at least he plays FOR Gregg Williams
All these people talking about how Welker will die and concerned about his health.

Why would the Doctors clear him if that was going to happen? Yet, they don't clear guys like Kevin Kolb, Jahvid Best, and Nick Collins? 
Great news!
Good luck, Wes. Hope he can end his career on a high note.
Red Raider for life 
I'm picturing the disembodied voice of Sean Connery saying "Don't go losing your head"
I wish him the best, but this makes me cringe. I worry about him taking *that hit* that ends up being catastrophic. Him and Austin Collie were the guys that just scare the shit out of me. If ever there was a case for guys becoming more and more prone to head injuries after each head injury it was these two. Also something about their style of play that makes them both so vulnerable. I hope it ends well for Wes. I really do. 
Does Wes know this?
So many people are so sure he is one big hit away from being killed.  I'm sure he will be fine.
This literally just happened in my madden save and I was laughing my butt off at the idea of it......
what the fuck man, wes is gonna be one of the dudes that is a textbook "this is why we take concussions seriously now" stories
My all-time favorite player. Hope he lights it up and stays as healthy as possible!
Good for him! Hopefully he stays healthy for his sake and his family's 
I've always loved St. Louis - I can't wait to play for the Cardinals.  

-- Wes Welker


Seriously though, I loved watching him play for Denver, but this seems dangerous given his health history.   I hope he does well for you, St. Louis. 
Hoping for the best, love Wes. Hopefully he can help out that offense if he's even a fraction of the guy he once was.
AHHHHH YES YES AHHHHH YES
plz catch the football plzzzzzz
Sportscenter tweet, deal reached https://twitter.com/SportsCenter/status/663856263428775937
This fuckin guy again? God dammit
Maybe he can actually catch a ball for us...
No, omg Welker no. You're having enough brain issues as it is and you want to go back out there? Think of your wife man...retire. 
Probably redundant but he doesn't give a shit about his life at all.  
So aside from the concussions and shit, was his suspension for methamphetamine usage? All I can see doing a quick google was a Positive test for amphetamines, which could be something like adderrall.
I think this is the funniest part...

&gt;Fisher said he was disappointed to be talking about another suspended player in the same week and said the Rams would be ramping up efforts to educate players on the dangers of drug use.

Think you need to start with the guy you just signed.
One hand, he has a concussion history and that's something to be mindful of. It's risky for both Wes Welker and the Rams. On the other, I think the Rams got away with one. Take concussions out of the discussion and you have a healthy and ready to go Wes Welker. I think if he stays healthy he's gonna do great things for the Rams.
Are we going to watch him die on field? I feel like that's his goal. Don't get me wrong, I love the guy.... But I really think it's time to call it quits. 
In other news l, Nick Foles is still just going to hand the ball to Gurley and let his defense and kicker win the games. 
This guy needs to quit already before he dies on the field.
But how does this affect Julian Edelman's value
im actually worried about this mans health
Is it just me, or do the Rams have a decent arsenal of offensive weapons now?
I wish him nothing but success in St. Louis but I'm still highly concerned about his personal health.

I really, really, really hope he remains healthy for the remainder of the season.
I know everybody is poking fun at the redditors advising him what to do because of the concussions, but I legitimately think this is a bad move. Not only for Welker, but for the NFL. Welker is almost guaranteed to have CTE later on in his life and more football will only make the issue worse. We won't know for quite a few decades but I wouldn't be surprised if Welker is a key piece in the future of CTE and the NFL just as Junior Seau and Mike Webster are.
Hopefully he can improve our terrible passing game without ruining the rest of his life. Obviously his/our doctor(s) said he's good to go, but the dude has had a lot of concussions. Should be interesting. 
This guy needs to retire. He's brain's probably already mush, he really needs to save his health.
Just in time for [Concussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2GsZRTW6XE)!
Welker only needs [178 yards](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/W/WelkWe00.htm) to reach the 10,000 yard mark for his career.  Good luck Wes!
I just hope he doesn't run out of bounds and slip getting a career ender, then again that might be the best thing for him.  

I love Welker, he's a great player, but I worry about him too, either he plays too hard, he's too small, or he's prone to injuries, but I really don't want to hear about how much brain damage he has in a decade.
RIP in peace
"Welker signs to Rams for $15/hr and $5 per catch commission."
I thought he was the white guy on the patriots
Be safe wes
I don't like this at all...
EDIT: sorry if I fear for the guy's health.
Well hopefully he won't take any hits to the head...

Edit: I guess wishing for his well being isn't appreciated here.
Well he never has to play the Rams, so I suppose he can stay healthy.
This dude literally might die on the field. I'm sure the Rams did their due diligence but you have to wonder how safe this is.
From West Welker to Wes Welker. The circle is complete. 
Local espn affiliate in stl said fisher has announced this already. 
I'm hyped! I just really hope he doesn't get another concussion, I don't think his brain can handle much more. 
First Bush now Welker. He's gonna get his brains blown out his ears. 
Put this on Wes...and stay safe out there my friend! 
http://i.imgur.com/jsb4Ar7.jpg
I wonder what this means for Bailey.


No shit? Hopefully he doesnt get hit the wrong way. Would hate to see him go down again. 
I really  hope the guy stays healthy 
I was already pulling for the Rams this year, I like this move.
I disagree with this turn of events. 
I feel worried about him, it's not worth it, and his last season was underwhelming.
Wes no
He will be wearing #19 with us

https://twitter.com/MylesASimmons/status/663876352777416707
Welcome to the NFC, Wes!
&gt;We care about player safety 
WTF Rams, I thought all the teams had an "understanding" that we wouldn't let Welker clobber himself to death.
Wow Rams are officially scary now! 

Right? 
Even as a Rams fan, who should be happy about this, I'm just concerned about Welker's health.
As a receivers coach? He shouldn't be allowed to play anymore after all those concussions.
I've never really worried about specific player dying on the field before this
What is the number on Welker for concussions... Just a comparison...
Word on the street is this guy's a scrappy gym rat! 
Honestly thought we were going to need him. Guess not.
Welker should just use a giant love sac as a helmet for now on, that melon will never rattle. 
seeing bridgewater get concussed was like chum in the water for Fisher.  concussions for everyone!
RIP WW. 
please stay safe wes :(
Although I am worried about his long term health I am glad he got another chance to play in the NFL. That being said, WE IN THOSE BOYS. SUPERBOWL HERE WE COME!
Great, we're all more more likely to see someone go brain dead on field. I'm not happy about this at all. 
good signing for the Rams, they have a great D...they just need to be able to score some more points
Rip in peace.
This just in... Welker suffered concussion, hitting his head getting into his car moments after signing contract.
His final resting place 
Damn!  You just had to come to the NFC West?
dropping eddie lacy for him. fuck it. my season is over anyway
Was reading an article on the NFL website about him trying to find a job yesterday, and I'm happy that dude found a job because it sounds like it's what he wants.  The writers there sure seemed to skirt the issue of brain damage pretty well, though... They mentioned injuries being a factor, but didn't specify why he was such a risk to sign.  Anyway, I love watching football but hope this guy can live into his fifties without talking like a monkey biscuits drunk person all the time. 
did welker get a ring with the pats?  honest question.
This seems like a poor decision. 
I'll respect his decision to play, as should everyone else. Yes, I think it's reckless but it's not my body that's on the line. Good luck WW! 
How will this affect Tavon Austin's value?
This guy survived a run-in with Aaron Hernandez so maybe luck is on his side 
I guess Welker has forgotten how to read the writing on the wall. Quit while you can still do basic arithmetic.
God speed. I hope he does well. 
wes welker is like an exgirlfriend. ive moved on and im happy with where i am, but i still really hope things work out for him.
I'd be more excited about this 3 or 4 years ago.

Welker has had so many concussions, I just don't think this is worth it for him.
There aint no rule that says a vegetable *can't* play football
Everyone's going to say that he shouldn't be playing because of his health. He has to be medically cleared first to play. There's more to the decision than "He's had a lot of concussions so he should retire".
Happy for him to get another chance, and nervous as well. Please be careful Wes.
As much as I think this is a good signing, as we have no consistent WR play outside of Tavon. I can't help but feel anxious about his future health and our team signing him contributing to further brain trauma. 
[deleted]
:( when is enough enough Wes. Sigh
I just hope his brain doesnt turn into mashed potatoes.
Well it looks like the Rams have found a new "out" of StL, they can't play on a field where somebody died!
If only Wes Welker was still alive to see this
I can't imagine what he'll look like in a rams uni. 
[deleted]
I wish him the best.

It was obvious that he still wanted to play so I'm glad he has the opportunity, I just hope he doesn't suffer another injury.
Next Monday's headline: Welker Concussions Again
Rams to lose Super Bowl 50 confirmed 
R.I.P. 
How many concussions has he actually had?
He just had a concussion signing the contract
I just think it is fucked up that anyone would sign him at this point. dude has scrambled eggs for brains and they are willing to let him start taking hits again.. 
"Who?" - Wes Welker
Well at least he's on their team so they won't be able to give him another concussion.... 
Good, I'm happy he's getting another chance. I don't understand why people think they know what's best for him. Even if they do, it's his life, let him play til' he dies if that's what will make him happy.
Follow your dreams welker 
Dude...hang it up man. He took way too many pot shots in his career. I love Wes,  but his health needs to come first. 
[deleted]
This just in. Wes Welker not sure where he is.
**GAME CHANGER**
history of concussions, but he's fine.
Three concussions in ten months, not sure if he is thinking anymore.
we are going to watch wes welker die on the football field arent we?
 At this point he's probably already ensured that he'll have CTE so he might as well try to make a few more bucks. I'm no doctor but all those hits to the head aren't good for the noggin.
MRW he gets the ball this season from now on... 

http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20150424014315/degrassi/images/5/5a/Cover_eyes_shining.gif
Bobblehead lines up in the slot once more!
Good. I love me some Wes.

Just please God be safe out there.
Well... I hope he's okay? I mean, if he can get cleared.. Fuck it. 
He must of found Don Beebe's Pro Cap!
Concushkin in the NFC west? Bad idea Wes.
I heard its way easier learning the alphabet the second time. 
They're going to fucking kill him in Offence V Defence drills. 

I thought he'd prefer a place with more SNOW ;-)
Good, he was my favourite receiver when he played for the pats. I was heart broken when he went to Denver but I'm glad he's been picked up again. 
I wish him the best but I serioulsy can't imagine this ending well for Welker.
Wow, surprised they'd be that desperate.
His career was over after he left New England.  Tom and co. made him amazing because they made him run out-routes and shallow under routes.  Denver threw him at Linebackers and Safeties over the middle and he got DESTROYED.  

Like look at Edelmans catches this year.  He only gets shallow crosses, out-routes, and flats.  Ya he gets fucked up thats cause he runs and lays his body out after the catch.  Welker in Denver got lit up right as he was catching it.  Utilizing Welker properly is the only way STL is going to save his career. Can't hate on the move though. Best of luck with him
[Welcome to the NFC West.](http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/imported_assets/2390740/wes-welker-gets-laid-out-a.gif)
Good luck Welker. Don't die on the field. 
Rams trying to become the Concussions Avatar.


First they mastered giving them, now they're looking to master receiving them. Soon they'll be master brain-benders.
He's trying out do Kelvin Kolb on ways to get concussed
[deleted]
Then he gets benched in the same game. What a game.
The fact that he is playing like garbage kind of makes this feel a little hollow.

Edit: I want to die
Peyton obviously not satisfied with Favre's passing yards record. Now he's going for the INT record!
He just broke it again. And again. Oh there he broke it again. 
THIS IS IT, STOP IT

Also, that was the most hilarious "next play sets a record" stretch I've ever seen. I think he was within 3 yards as of 8 min left last week. Took 15 min and 3 possessions to get 3 yards.
Peyton only cares about the third and eight
What a career for chicken parm 
Top 10 recipients of Peyton Manning passing yards from [NFL's Twitter](https://twitter.com/NFL/status/666008588230332416)
I hope he throws for a loss of yards and they announce "Brett Favre now has the record for most yards in NFL history"
Manning getting benched in the same game he sets the all-time passing record is not how I imagine he wanted to remember it.
üéµbroke the record,  then got benchedüéµ
Good job, Peyto!
Very interesting that he set the record and retired in the same game
Manning's record setting day at halftime: 4-15, 30 yards, 3 INTs. Unless he turns it around in the second half this is going to be one of the worst performances to set a record ever...
How many chicken parms equal 71,839 yards?
Next, Favre's interception record!
*joke about Brett farve coming out of retirement*
Gif of play?
Did they count Brett's pick-6 yardage into that equation?
He wanted to keep the drive going and not stop to celebrate. Classic Peyton. 
Passing Jets legend Brett Favre
And he couldn't be any less interested
Did anyone else see #22 of the Chiefs saluting Payton? Thought that was pretty cool!
headline could just read "Peyton Manning has broken."
Peyton doesn't look good this year, but that is pretty damn awesome. Congratulations, Peyton.
*with 4 INTs today, Manning has moved into 9th place on the all time INTs list. He is now 1 behind Marino.*
Congrats Peyton. One of the best all time
Congrats to him. Proud he did it as a Bronco. 

Now get your shit together and stop throwing INT's. 
http://i.imgur.com/3JoNv.gif
Crap that means the Broncos will finally bench him
Watching Giants/Pats game. CBS has twice borked the Peyton replay. I still haven't seen the pass.
Three more picks in the first half.  I doubt Kubiak has the guts, but it's time to bring Brock Osweiler in the second half.
Now I know what Peyton is doing.. Now that he got that record from Brett, he wants to take his INT record too! You go Peyton, leave him with nothing!
Still a couple thousand away from record in all of professional football.
"TD record. Check. Yardage record. Check. INT Record. Watch your back Favre"-Peyton Manning
He's celebrating by throwing to the chiefs.
It's almost like his body said "There? I did it! Happy?" and then turned the fuck off.
Looked like he didn't want the game to stop. Anyway, he deserves it. We can all tell our kids that we saw Peyton Manning playing football. And that, kids, it's fucking awesome. 
Now he's trying to catch Favre's interception total
And then gets benched. 
I see he moved on to trying to beat Favre's interceptions record
And gets benched in the same game. This is a cruel game we love. 
HE JUST GOT BENCHED FOR BROCK FRIGGIN OSWEILLER! This is indeed the worst record setting performance I've ever witnessed. 
And then proceeded to get interception after interception after interception after interception, dang Peyton what happened?
Now go sit on the bench.
now he's after Favre's interception record
And now he can retire in peace

RIP
At this point I'm almost expecting Farve to enter the THanksgiving game against us later this month to reclaim the throne
At least Favre still holds the interceptions record!

:'(
Is he also trying to break Favres record for ints as well?
Peyton trying to catch Favre for most career INTs too.
Break an amazing record, have the worst game of your career and get benched.
Now for the all time interception record!
And he did so in Favre fashion
It's sad that he played like hot garbage the game he breaks an insane record... (Being serious)
And he needs to retire.
Since that throw: 4-for-18 31 yards, zero touchdowns, four interceptions.

*‚ô™‚ô¨ Record set, now time to suck ‚ô™‚ô¨*
And he has a 2.8 QB rating.
(Grumble grumble) congratulations  (Grumble grumble)
Next up is the INT record. 
Looking like this [guy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CT400KgUAAE2dOZ.jpg) right about now
and then took the bench for Osweiler... 
Peyton manning almost as as many completions to the chiefs as he did to his own team.
And he couldn't have looked like he gave less of a shit after either.

Everybody's trying to celebrate and make a big deal of it, and he's just trying to move on with the game.

Shame how the rest of the game played out.
All while watching the Broncos get decimated.
Then got benched
The game was so satisfying.
Brett Favre will come out of retirement now, watch.
And now he has been sent to the bench after 4 INTs. Weird day to break a record in one of your worst games ever. 
First QB to have a QB rating when attempting at least 10 passes of 0 since 2007
...in the most humiliating fashion possible.  Wish Favre's record could stand, but if it's going to be broken, this is the best possible way for it to happen.
"Peyton Manning has broken."
Wow..this is cringe...he broke the record and got benched in the same game...
You just won the battle for first.

Congrats Peyton, we still love you
And if he keeps playing like this he's going to lose it.
With 4 ints and being pulled from the game.  Congrats! 
And has been benched for Brock Osweiler. 
Jesus, he might be having the worst game of his career. Hell of a way to break the record.
I wonder if Brady will decline this quickly too. :/
Now benched. Wow.
And now he's benched.
Breaks all time passing yards AND benched in the same game? Unprecedented.
In other news, he's on the bench
Kind of a mixed honor. He's also been benched.
Seems like Manning is already gunning for that one final Favre record he can break...

Seriously though, congrats to Peyton for being all time passing leader! What a career!
now he's gunning for Farve's INT record
I feel really bad he got the record on maybe the worst game of his career. Set the all time passing record, but throwing 5 completions and 4 interceptions before being sat in the 3rd is an awful game to achieve this on.
...but wait, there's more!
.....and then reformatted his hard drive and erased PASSING.EXE
This will be a nice little trivia fact years from now.

Peyton breaks the all time career passing yard record then gets benched in the same game due to performance. 
Pey-ton you should stop play-ing
and this was just such a great game to finally do it...
Peyton Manning breaking NFL Passing Yards Record, also gets benched in the same game for only having 5 completions and 4 interceptions.
What a shame CBS didn't cut away from NE-NYG to show that live.
Congrats on the karma
Congrats to Big Parma. 
-7...... Ruined my fantasy life. 
Damn, he did not want to stop for that
I'm so glad this was the game. Thank you Colts. Also fuck you Colts
Looks like the all time passing yards record may have broken Peyton
You gotta love that Peyton was more frustrated with not getting the first down than happy about beating the record.
And he looked like he didn't give a shit afterward so.
Congrats. 

Who's going to take this record from Manning? 
Does this mean Peyton Manning &gt; Jeff George?
http://a.video.nfl.com/films/2015/GAME_HIGHLIGHT/in-game-highlight/NFLCOM/REG/10/151115_bp_den_peyton_manning_breaks_record_344314_3200k.mp4
Now to just get that interception record and he can retire a happy man
"And for the remainder of the game, Eli has siphoned all of his brothers talent into him"
His team is still losing though.
lol but the mother fucker is 5-20.. safe to say he gives up after the record??
And he just got benched...


And then got benched!
In the same game that ended his career!
Is there a record for the worst playing that broke a record?
Great career, but from now on he's Jordan playing for the Wizards.  Actually, more like Namath playing for the Rams.
Peyton Manning with the Jamaal Crawdord special: 5/20, 4 TO, costing his team the game.
Definitely playing like he broke that record...


The fall off is real when you start reaching Favre's numbers. It's like a threshold telling you it's time to retire, do not venture beyond this point. For it leads into a disappointing, interception-filled abyss.
and threw 4 interceptions, Chiefs had more yards in penalties then Denver had in the 1st half

Too bad he sucks.
Meanwhile, Peyton joins Eli and Archie in the 0.0 Passer Rating Club.
Soon. 

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CT5eJolUwAAVdVi.jpg:large
Who was the old dude they handed the record-breaking ball to? Was it a rep from the HOF?
In pretty spectacularly terrible fashion.  Way to go, though.
Not like this Peyton not like this 
Dude throws like 3 picks I bet lol
The reall story here is Peyton Manning gets benched after throwing 4 picks and playing like shit. Who cares about a meaningless record. He only got it because he has been playing for like a century.
Brett Favre: "I'm coming out of retirement"
Going for INT record now.
And now he wants to break that interception record.
An ode to Peyton: I have so many good memories, wrote about you in many diaries, I spent many a game watching you with my friends, but I fear that this is the end. I respect you with everything in my being, yet I don't fear you leaving. For these Broncos are built for greatness, but your age has boughten you lateness. Hail Santan with all of your glory, fuck Tom Brady's wife with all of her whorey,  hail Peyton for all of his stories.
Do they count yards after interception in that stat? 
Next week, Saint Peyton will be turning water into wine and feeding the multitudes with a loaf of bread.

Ugh.  I want to post Peyton's mug on /r/punchablefaces 

Edit:  But maybe that's just me?

3 interceptions, 0 pts at half vs the fuckin chiefs, peyton is so washed up, wish he had 1more year left, fuckin dt suffering so much
And then gets benched... Lol
Still would rather take favre, Marino, Montana, elway, Brady, young or fouts over him anyday
Congratulations to Peyton! 
Neat.
Lol he wanted to keep driving
Congrats PFM!
Peyton Manning has broken. 
Kubiak actually has guts!  Now I hope the Broncos come back so Manning is permanently benched!
It's pretty depressing how this game turned out; feels like his career is coming to a close.
Fantastic milestone in his career, and kudos to him for it.  On the other hand, he looked very nonplussed about the whole thing.
He looked too excited. In all seriousness though, that is so many passing yards I can't believe it. 
He was doing everything in his power to avoid it.
http://i.imgur.com/RG0BS1U.gif 
Noice. 
Congrats Peyton, what a career. However it looks like this is the final ride for Peyton. Can't believe it but he's finished. 
At this rate he will beat his most ints record as well xD
Go Manning!
And they're losing.
An inauspicious game to break the record: 4 interceptions already vs. only 5 receptions.
And gets benched in the same game.
At least he has that today
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand he's benched
And with that record comes 4 ints and a seat on the bench.
Holy jesus - 5/20 with 4 INTs?

Wow
and he just got BENCHED. 
Aaaaaaaaaaaand benched.
Aaaaand now he's benched.
And then he got benched
As a fan of Kentucky football and the Titans, I really hate Peyton Manning. But he is one, if not the best QBs, to ever play.  I have had the pleasure of attending games in Nashville many times with him as the opposing QB and known that I was witnessing greatness.  Also he was hilarious on SNL.  Congrats to a 6'5" asshole with a laser, rocket arm.
Aaaaaaaaaand he's on the bench
Peyton Manning gets benched
That was an unimpressive way to break a record.
Manning broke the record then retired mid game
That was like that time Al Bundy gave his soul to the devil so he could play for the Bears in the Super Bowl, then when he got there, was killed.  Wow...
I honestly thought that guy wouldn't make it in the NFL when he first came out of UT, but he's been proving me wrong for a very long time now. His career is nearing an end, however, he will be remembered as one of the best. It is a shame this record had to come on his worst day as a QB, but one game doesn't make a career.
Peyton Manning has also broken himself
Gawd, could his head get any bigger/taller after this? 
And then gets benched.
Manning's *career* QB rating dropped from 96.8 to 96.5 tonight.
...and Brett Favre has cursed all QB's that ever beat one of his records to suffer their worst game of their career.
Question now is if he will get the win record.
In only the worst performance of his career. 
HAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. I think the DBs had more receiving yards from Manning than his receivers.
Peyton&gt;&gt;&gt;Brady
Don't get me wrong, this record is a great record to have, but I wouod imagine both Favre and Manning would trade that record for the career of Montana, Brady, and Bradshaw.
most manning thing ever, throwing a pick trying to break the record, then pimping a ten minute celebration on a dump off after checking down for 4 yards.
Legend
Now can we bench him? Please
I hope he retires tomorrow now that he's got his record. He is absolutely terrible now. It's a shame that defense has no chance at a SuperBowl because of the highest paid player on the team.
Ok he was benched but jeeze the guys 39 and took Denver to 7-0 this season. Cut the guy some slack...
Pey-ton threw the fuck-ing ball!


*Nationwide jingle*
He can still go negative
Seems like this kids gonna be good. He's got one helluva career ahead of him!
gratz
How annoyed can a man look at breaking a huge record? 
PAPA JOHNS FOR EVERYONE TONIGHT!!!
I wonder how much of a factor the passing record played in him playing this last game. 
I have plantar faciitis in my left foot, I can't even imagine the pain of it being torn
This might be it folks....
For anyone that doesn't have plantar fasciitis, it is like you're stepping on a large nail every so often. Fine, fine, crippling pain, fine, fine, fine, crippling pain...

I don't even want to think of what a torn plantar fascia feels like.
This has to be his last season, I can't see him playing another 16+ games after this year.
I hope it doesn't turn into laminitis.
Wow. Brady/Manning bowl might end at 16 :(. 
I think he's also got a case of "old," unfortunately.

Hope he makes a full and speedy recovery.

But I also hope he hangs up the cleats. Nobody wants to see old-man-Manning get beat up and underperform.

This could get real ugly.
Please don't let this be it, I don't want to live in a world where that was his last game. 

*[sigh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oabcM9SOF-E)* 

I guess we're bringing in The Lobster.
Something tells me that this will persist at least until the Broncos see what they have with Osweiler. We might have already seen the last of Brady vs Manning.
Wow, that really sucks for Peyton. But imagine if he tore it in practice and he was forced to retire while three yards away from the record.
Fuuuuuuuuuuu
I live in Jersey, really not a lot of great options to see a Broncos game this year. I bought a ticket to the Pittsburgh game last week hoping to see one of Peyton Manning's last games and be a part of a great final season. That trip is gonna be a lot worse if this is it for him. (*Bitter sigh*)

^*Alex ^Smith ^is ^the ^kindest, ^bravest, ^warmest, ^most ^wonderful ^human ^being ^I've ^ever ^known ^in ^my ^life.*
That's *All time passing record holder* Peyton Manning to you
Interesting how this is now a thing just because Schefter tweeted it. Vic Lombardi of CBS4 reported it last week.

http://denver.cbslocal.com/2015/11/11/peyton-manning-has-been-playing-with-plantar-fasciitis/
I think it's finally time for Peyton to harvest Eli's body to continue playing.
This is like watching you 19 year old golden retriever limping around and crying, and everyone in the family knows it's time to put it down but no one wants to be the first to say it. 
As someone who's had plantar fasciitis for the last...year...and ran ~1500 miles on it since then..PF sucks. It hurts so bad with just inflammation...I can't even imagine tearing it.
[I'M ALL IN ON THE HYPE. CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/Lzx0Aqe.png)

SUPER BOWL 50 HERE WE COME!

EDIT: FUCK PRO LINE. CANCELLED THE ORDER AND SPENT $30 MORE FOR NIKE!
This would explain his poor performance this year. Hard enough to make throws downfield if he has nerve problems in his shoulder, but having foot problems too must make it next to impossible to for him to get comfortable and set himself correctly to make the throws.

If this keeps him out of games then there's no way Denver gets a first-round bye week this year, not with their schedule. Cincinnati and New England will lock those tops seeds up in a few weeks if they keep winning games.
He's been the cause of more football heartache for me than any other player.  I always loved watching him play teams other than KC, though.  Especially that Super Bowl team (as an Iowa alum, that team with Bob Sanders and Dallas Clark was so awesome to watch).
Im sure that affects him greatly in his mechanics, but would that be the biggest reason why he is throwing the ball like its a feather?  

EDIT:  Thanks for all the replies, I can see that this would greatly hinder his ability to throw the ball with any sort of power.
time to sign tebow!
Mmmm Bears love the taste of Lobster. Delicious Brock Lobster. 
Manning needs to retire not only for the sake of his health, but the Broncos can't win with him throwing multiple interceptions every game.

[Good night sweet prince](http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m0hryrATkN1r7bma7o1_400.gif) 
He should have retired at the end of last year. 
Goodnight sweet prince.  &lt;insert putting horse down metaphor here&gt;
After he finished last year hurt, I feared we would see a repeat this year. But is has been far worse than I imagined. I'm not really sure how good Osweiler actually is, but seeing him in comparison to Manning, both in his mobility as well as the zip he had on his throws, the contrast was amazing. The Broncos had a pretty tough stretch run to end things. Bears, Patriots, Steelers, Bengals... they had better win that Bears game, and it doesn't look easy at all. Plus the Chargers twice and the Raiders. They have to scrounge up 3 wins somewhere... 
I can hear Favre getting in shape ...
Dan Marino had a proper send off. Losing 62-7 to the Jags. 
This news is horrible. After battling mild plantar fasciitis for about a year myself, I can't imagine a TORN plantar fascia. I wish him the best.
Let's pretend we're not injured and play terribly and jeopardize our health, legacy, and ruin the season for his team. Thought Peyton was smarter than that tbh
The anti-Roethlisberger.
Had the Broncos disclosed the foot injury (not the tear, but the plantar fasciitis) on the injury report? Were they required to do so?
Fuck, I'm super late, but I was just diagnosed with plantar fasciitis this weekend. I'd consider it more of an annoyance than an injury. But I feel like tearing it would hurt like a bitch. Too bad I can't afford the $600 orthotics my doctor wants me to wear.

Do your foot stretches and come back Peyton, though I strongly dislike you, I can't live without at least one more Manning vs. Brady :'(
He's been battling injuries since last year.  Its not a good sign for someone his age to be unable to stay healthy.  There is a good chance his body just can't take the punishment any more . 
I hate to be the guy that makes a excuse for Peyton.. Believe me, but he looked really gimpy Sunday.
Yeah.  Nobody doubts his skill and talent and his mind, but I don't think he has the ability to stay healthy through a full season anymore, and that in turn affects how he throws.

He has nothing left to prove, so if he does hang it up, well, it's been a privilege watching him.
Damn.

I have plantar fasciitis. It sucks baalllsss
    This is the way the world ends
    This is the way the world ends
    This is the way the world ends
    Not with a bang but a whimper. 
Golf, meet Peyton. Peyton, meet golf.
Manning Dismissed. Bring in the dancing lobsters.
So much for the Manning-Brady GET HYPE matchup in a couple weeks. :/
And to think I was actually enjoying my Sundays not watching Football and learning to play D&amp;D. 
It's so hard for me to see it all go down like this. This is likely his last season, and it is being tainted by the interceptions and performances that are not Peyton-esque. It is an unfortunate side-effect of being so great for so long, eventually you will not be able to perform at a level that is expected of you based on previous performance. When he signs that one day contract with Indianapolis and announces his retirement I am going to be a mess. It may sound cliche, but as someone who grew up watching 18 throw touchdowns to Marvin, Reggie, Dallas, Brandon, Edgerrin, and whoever else was in the lineup a part of my childhood will die with Peyton's retirement. I'm going to miss him every Sunday. He will always be the GOAT in my eyes no matter what anyone else says.
Tebow time!
 I'm Ready for Gruden \ Manning Monday night football! 
Losing feeling in my toes....
Without this injury, Manning probably throws 3 INTs instead of 4 yesterday 


Can't forget how poorly he was playing earlier in the season (Ravens, Chiefs, Browns, Vikings, Raiders)
So apparently its unacceptable to even suggest that this injury might be a way to bench Peyton without "benching" him? Cause apparently the Denver media's been saying exactly that.
Well, it'd be a real bitch to have this happen and retire being 3 yards short of the career yardage record.
I hope when he hangs up the cleats he can still somehow be involved in the game. Either announcing or coaching. Can't have a legend end their football career like that.
Well, time for Peyton Manning to retire after this season..and to be welcomed back to the Indianapolis Colts as their new GM.
This reminds me so much of Brett Favre last season in Minnesota. Injuries and declining skills. The only difference is Peytons team is still in the playoff hunt.
Manning needs to get benched. I'm a huge fan of him and everything he's done to our franchise the last few seasons, but the guy is obviously performing very poorly. 9 TD's and what? 17 interceptions? Any other QB would have been benched a few games ago. If he is too hurt to perform he needs to step back and coach up the next QB. It gets to a point where you hurt the team with your play. It was nice to see Lobster throw with some zing and be able to avoid sacks and run with the ball 
So he was fighting through shoulder pain, rib pain and terrible pains in his foot?

With as much focus on player safety this year, is anyone arguing that he should have been out there in the first place?

The only reason he had to play this game was if Peyton didn't think he was getting another shot at a game to get the passing record. For as down to earth as he's been portrayed (his entire career) I can't imagine his ego and pride got the better and he had to play.

And now his foot is worse. Self-fulfilling prophecies are just awful.
Corrected to his left foot
God dammit, Donald
The poor old guy already has no feeling in the tips of his fingers

Don't be Jordan on the Wizards or Emmett Smith on the Cardinals......retire already and take comfort in the fact that you had a Hall of Fame career and it ended on a high note
If not for the eye poke Peyton would have got his record in Indy.
Possible end of an era. 
I am now so damn sad. I was born in 1996, but I started to love football when 1998 rolled around, when my favorite team drafted Randy Moss and the Colts (my second favorite team at the time) drafted Peyton Fucking Manning. I can't remember a time when Peyton wasn't dominating the league. Because of Peyton, I dreamed of becoming an NFL quarterback. I dreamed of facing him, my idol, in an actual game. While those dreams never manifested, I still feel like I've been punched in the stomach with an iron fist. This may be the end for Peyton Manning's storied career, but I don't really know an NFL without him. It's probably better this way, so he doesn't come back and try to play again, probably ending his career on an even lower note than this is. It still hurts so much though.
I had plantar fasciitis on both feet before. Not fun at all. 
Peyton is too stubborn for his own good... they should have pulled him the moment he got the record.  He's getting too old to fight through injuries like that.
&gt;inb4 Favre comes out of retirement to get the record again. 
I had plantar fasciitis. It sucks. Bought straussburg socks on Amazon and slept in them for a week. Bam! Fixed!
God Plantar Fascitis hurts so fucking bad. I can't imagine playing football on it, I got it in high school and it felt like needles sticking into my fucking feet.
[Hope this isn't the end of the road for him...](https://media.giphy.com/media/wMqw4hddRzKAU/giphy.gif)
Fly him over to Germany, 24/7 stem cell IV, all meals are stem cells, stem cell enema, full body soak in stem cells all week, fly him back for Sunday's game.
I really don't see the point in continuing to play him. He obviously is a legend and one of the best ever, but at this point he is hurting the team with his play.  he is old, injured, and its only going to get worse as the hits, colder weather, and weekly grind continue. get him his final victory to set the record and then go with brock. there is no way brock is worse than 17 ints in 9 games. Manning isn't benched because of him name and legend status. Any other QB would have been benched by now. If brady was playing this way you know BB would make the switch. it may be coldblooded, but this is what they are paid for. 
I hope Peyton keeps playing until there's some kind of legal ordinance forcing him to stop.

If this does happen to be his last season, I hope he takes a well-deserved year or two off and transitions into coaching. The NFL needs his football brain.
I can't believe people are shocked by this. He's had major injuries every year for the last three years now.  Two sprained ankles in 13, thigh issues last year, now this. His body was spent last year and it was a matter if time this year before something happened. 

I wish him well and all the best. He had a great career 
So he hid an injury, or the HC let him play injured, and compromised the team's performance. Good job, Peyton/Kubes.   
Enjoy the record from the worst/last game of your career.

The Colts were/are being investigated for not disclosing Luck's injury, correct?

Is this a completely different scenario? Seems like the Broncos were hiding Manning's injury in order to get him a record.

I'm really asking - I don't know the difference.
The idea that you shouldn't retire apon an injury is dangerous and insulting.
https://i.imgur.com/tN6ST1m.png
Great day to be a Bears fan. Sad day to be a football fan. Hope he gets better. But not better by Sunday. But better.
How lucky. Now he doesn't need the embarrassment of finishing the season and throwing 30 picks.
Can't say I'll be sorry to see him go. Truly an amazing player and career if this is how it ends. 
Just a matter of time before he throws a hip out.
I think they didn't want to disresepect him by straight up benching him, so they blamed it on plantar fasciitis, so he can save some face.
They'll probably still force him to play next week. 
He should have retired last year
I have this in my right foot. It's excruciating. It feels like you're standing with a nail through your foot. Even walking makes it worse. You feel it every step.
How long has he been dealing with this?  

The concept of Manning sucking ass at all even at almost 40 is still bizarre to me, so part of me still wondered if he was hurt with all the ducks he threw.

Is it enough to explain the other 8 shitty starts?
why do you bring up his injuries after he sucks balls for a couple weeks?
I don't know why I always expected (**NOT** hoped) he would take a big hit, would start to get up, and just stay down, or just call time out and limp off the field. I expected him to be playing his all, still be functioning and making plays, and only to be taken out because he got injured mid-play. Not to be benched because he threw 4 interceptions. 

Hearing about these injuries, it makes his performance understandable but...just sad :-(
He's done.
Well maybe he'll be healthy for the playo..

..hm
Looks like it's off the glue factory for ol' Peyton.
*‚ô™‚ô¨ Peyton's foot must hurt a lotttt ‚ô™‚ô¨*
I'm throwing it out there, but would signing Kaepernick this offseason be the biggest move the Bronco's make if Manning retires? 

I don't see how he wouldn't fit the bootleg/mobile scheme. The offensive line has to get some pieces back and is still developing. Kaepernick would be able to move around the pocket. 

Forget about his troubles in SF. His heart and mind aren't with that team anymore. The guy can play.
Broncos fans: What's the true feeling of Brock out there? Is there belief he can lead the team?
[deleted]
With this news, Peyton Manning is now 159-0 when he isnt injured .


LMFAO Espn, they simply can't understand that Manning plays bad.
What's the timetable on recovering from something lik this?  Would he be ready for the playoffs if he sat until then?
[deleted]
The prophecy is being fulfilled.

Unleash the Lobster!!
I can't remember a great athlete like this going out on SUCH a shitty note. Like, he's a bottom five qb in the league right now
:( I was hoping he was just in another slump. It seems injuries really alter his play. Sigh we the broncos can not seem to get a great offense and great defense together in the same season. Although I think our offense has the weapons at WR it needs
remember, HOF Jonathan Ogden ended his career with Turf Toe.... effing feet screw everything up. 
Why haven't they been letting him rest. Sit him out til playoffs so he can make one last run at it.
Didn't Brett Favre end his career in a similar way, i.e. due to injury?
Brock Lobster...
But will he still throw ducks she he comes back?
I would guess this is just a way for them to justify giving him certain games off during the rest of the season.  I bet my house he'll be playing the patriots in 2 weeks.  
I've sprained that tendon before, I'm shocked Peyton was even standing. 
So what does this mean? How long till he's healthy.
Let him rest for 6 weeks. Play him the game before the playoffs, if he's good stick with him, if he sucks-bench him
Peyton has drawn a lot of comparisons to Dan Marino throughout his career. I'm sorry to say that Peyton looks like he's primed to emulate the end of Marino's career too :( 
I had plantar fasciitis in both feet after running a marathon. I can tell you that it was almost impossible to walk on.
Having had plantar fasciitis, that is impressive that he was even able to try playing with it. The pain is incredible every move you make with the foot. Absolutely horrible. 
Poor fella is done-
[Albert Pujols has the same injury and will be sidelined 5-6 months.](http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/eye-on-baseball/25368342/angels-albert-pujols-out-nearly-five-months-after-right-foot-surgery) Recovery from this injury is an uphill battle for baseball players. I imagine this type of injury could be career threatening for football players especially for an aging quarterback. 

Edit: typo
Has a pats fan I'm heated we don't get a pure final battle between Tom and Peyton :( both powerhouses, true tests for both squads , fuck injuries 
I have bad plantar fasciitis.  Now, I'm not a professional athlete, but my experience is that it's not something that typically hinders you from performing athletically.  It hurts like hell afterwards, but you should be able to keep it stretched out enough to make it through a football game.
This makes me sad. On the other hand, I feel very fortunate to have had to opportunity to witness history. Next step - Canton.
What a shame. I wouldn't doubt it if we saw his last game on Sunday. It's awesome that he got the record, but at what cost? This whole season for him has looked like one last painful ditch effort to leave his final mark. 

I would hate for him to go out on a game like that. 
I have plantar fasciitis and tore mine a year ago playing basketball... It is extremely painful to put any weight on the foot and also takes a few months to heal (the pain at least).
Well this explains a lot. 
Just recently got over a fully torn plantar fascia. Took 4 months to be able to play football again, with caution. Feels a lot like glass stuck deep in your heel and even when you walk on the ball of your foot, extreme pain. Its one of those injuries that takes a while to heal since weight is constantly on it, even in a walking boot. Since his is partially torn, I'd expect to see him playing in 4-6 weeks
This is so sad what a shitty end to a career, hope he comes back for the playoff run.
Ends just like that huh...
So how do the Broncos do with the Brock Lobster?
Peyton Manning has to retire soon
Kind of annoyed Osweiler is getting the start against the Bears. I wanted us going against Manning...which i a sad indication of how far he's fallen.
More twitter accounts as news sources. Good old journalism.
Torn plantar fascia?

Holy shit. I can't imagine how painful that must be. 
Sucks to see him injured but I'm glad his bad play wasn't him being himself. Hopefully he can heal up and finish the season as his old self
I battled plantar fasciitis for two years. I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy. It sucks.
The broncos should release him and after he gets better, he can come back to tennessee and retire there.....its a perfect fit
My question is: If both the QB and the Coach, knew that it was hurting him why didn't they do anything about it before he started to play, making the injury worse. Fox did this with him last year at the end of the season. I would rather have him benched for a few games, and have him healthy for the play-offs .
that's the problem with Age, 2 years ago he was lighting up the league and now he may be finished. same thing happened with Favre, the drop off for QB's is ridiculous. 

this is one of the reason's I hate seeing all those "brady can play for 3-4 more years" articles, everyone gets old and injuries are more affecting when your older. 

it shouldn't be a knock on a guy's skill and career that they got old and had injuries, it happens. people want to play as long as possible but time eventually tells them to quit. 
I cannot for the life of me understand why he's been playing. Are his personal records really more important to the Denver organization than wins? Yes, kudo to PFM for his accolades.. But is it really worth it? PFM was going to break the record eventually. It's not like he was actively trying to be the fastest QB to x amount of yards. 

For the sake of the team, let this guy heal up. I don't fucking understand. Seeing coaches make decisions like this make me wonder what they're thinking. 

Someone explain this to me.I truly don't understand.

Congrats on the record, though!
Was he ever on the injury report?
Here's a tidbit that shows just how bad Manning's day was yesterday.... his career QB Rating dropped by 0.3 and, for now, [Tom Brady has moved ahead of him on career QB Rating.](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_rating_career.htm)

Of course Aaron Rodgers will finish his career far ahead of the both of them and Brady's rating will probably dip as well in his final few years.
Broncos best bet is to bench him for as long as possible. I think it'd be very tough for us to not win the division. Then bring him in for the playoffs. Brock can get us 3 more wins. And our division won't compete with that. 
Happy trails to one of the greatest QBs in the NFL. It's O.V.E.R
Are you fucking serious? Go and watch those interceptions again. That was Peyton, not his foot, throwing those interceptions. Look at his 3rd INT, it was INEXCUSABLE! He's had a fucking atrocious season, and fans can clearly see this has not been the same Peyton.



I don't care if it's him being selfish for the record, or just the deterioration of his play, IT CAN NOT BE BLAMED ON INJURY EVERYTIME HE FAILS. 



Peyton needs to take it like a man when he fails and not find a scapegoat injury to blame. Losing all respect for him. Fucking atrocious on the field and off.
Goodnight sweet prince :(
They got Lucky when the bred the Colt, now it's time to turn him to glue.  
  
May you rest in Omaha. 
Nobody seems to be saying it here, but I think the most likely scenario is Peyton sits out about 3-6 weeks and starts again week 16 or 17. I really doubt he has started his last game.
Now those bronco "fans" that wanted manning replaced will get what they asked for....except I don't think they will like the results.
I hope he can sign a 1 day contract and retire a colt. I'm going to miss him being in the league, but I've also missed watching the old Peyton. Outside of the Bengals he was my favorite thing to watch in football.
so why did he keep his helmet on for the whole rest of the game?
Never count out backup Brock. BrockLobster will rise. 
Just retire please. 
Had too look up "plantar fascia". Think I've actually sprained mine before. Could barely put any weight on my foot at all. He was trying to play through that?
I want to make Peyton a chicken parm sandwich tonight 
I mean.. I think his best option is to retire this year and become Head Coach of the Colts. 

Or better yet, replace Phil *Seems* as a commentator. 
Elway is putting the wrong kind of pressure on this team. No long term vision, only win-now desperation.
Broncos gonna end season 7-9 
Seems to me like every time manning sucks ass a story comes out about how he was secretly injured. Can't wait for him to retire so he can leave the headlines.
Was this on the injury report or is it an excuse?
Fucking Kobe AND Manning are probably over? End of an era...
Is Kubiak that good? Because now Elway has to live with his decision of basically giving up on Manning. 
Well, that's all she wrote folks. 

Whether or not this is it, I always knew Manning would go down swinging. 
You should have seen the Patriots Giants thread. People were rooting for Peyton to crumble more than rooting for their own team  (the Patriots) to win
So his sore foot made him throw all those INTs? Convenient excuse. 
but he had played enough to break the record.

Proves me right, all this guy cares about is personal glory. Fuck him.
Pey-Ton-Man-Ings-Car-Eers-Done
Gotta hand it to Peyton. He's the greatest of all time when it comes to making excuses! 
Plantar fasciitis is bad, but it's not a career ender.  Get some cortisone shots and stretch.
My Peyton it's over it's done your job in the NFL has been accomplished. 
JUST LET ME HAVE THIS!
Sunday, Bloody Sunday, Round 2.
What a terrible end to it all. 
&gt;It is also associated with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise

And that is why you should not diagnose yourself from information you find on the internet. 


Im glad he got the all time record in yards
Shoulda sold high on Sanders. FUCK.
rest him for a few weeks. Let him loose for one of our last few games to see how he plays. If he plays great he breaks the win record and we go into the playoffs with Manning ready to go, if not we go into the playoffs with a Lobster looking for a first playoff win and a great defense to back him up
We killed each other's QBs :'(

I mean, technically both were injured before, but that game exacerbated everything. 
Regardless of whatever injury he has been battling, he was playing pretty horrendous this year. I have dropped him in fantasy leagues. I think this might be his last season. Or coming back for a mentoring role next year.
[deleted]
Peyton is robbing us of Brady Manning XVII! If he doesn't start in two weeks, he's failed every NFL fan.
Is this the end?  I wanted to see Brady vs. Manning XVII, but I'm told this kind of injury is pretty serous.

Can't help thinking that the Broncos traded a couple of wins this year (and potentially playoff HFA) for Manning's records.  Worth it from my POV because this guy is an all time great, but then again I'm not a Broncos fan hoping for another SB run...
Hes lucky his defense is the best in the league because wow.....WHAT A SELFISH MOTHERFUCKER.
Who hasn't had plantar fasciitis? Drop in an insole and suck it up. 
Watching yesterdays game I was wondering what fake injury Elway was going to come with in order to bench Egg head. Well, here it is
This is all my fault and I feel terrible.  I'm sorry Peyton.  I shouldn't have drafted you in the 3rd round. It was doomed from there on.   
dudes like.. old
Would love to see Peyton come back as an OC for the Giants. 
 I see the NFL has once again rejected my offer to read slam poetry for the halftime show.
Look at the refs

Look how they throw flags at you

And everything you do

Yeah they were all yellow
They should just have a UFC main event
Is it me or is it pretty obvious from all of the rumors and the fact that it was announced kind of late, that this was clearly the NFLs 3rd or 4th choice? 
To appease the NFL in light of the ongoing concussion crisis, the band will refrain from playing "A Rush of Blood to the Head".
[Once again outsourcing AMERICAN jobs to foreigners!](http://i.imgur.com/vByIYJF.gif)
My rule of thumb for halftime acts: If they're relevant and your mom has them on her car mixtape, they're going to the Super Bowl.
0/10 not GWAR.
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Should've been Left Shark doing standup.
I like Coldplay's first two albums; fight me. 
This Super Bowl is going to be the Adventure of a Lifetime
This is what we get for sending all those Jags games over there
Welp, good thing I can disable inbox replies
FOO FIGHTERS PLS
Fuck all of y'all I like Coldplay.
Their song Viva La Vida always reminds me of Cold Storage on Halo 3 and I have no fucking clue why
Still waiting for the Foo Fighters 
Not a terrible choice. I like this better than the Adele rumor that was going around.
As long as Left Shark makes an appearance I'm good.
FOOTBALL FANS, YOU ARE NOT THE TARGET MARKET. PUT THAT INTO YOUR HEAD BEFORE YOU ACT DISGUSTED 

It's specifically targeted for the people who don't watch football like it's their job.

Once again my hopes for AC/DC are smashed. Didn't expect them to, but it still hurts.
I enjoy Coldplay, so I'm fine with the choice. I wish we got T-Swift, but they're a good second choice. Happy it wasn't Adele, tbh.
eh. At least it's not Bruno Mars for the second time in 3 years. 
Could've had outkast.
You know how I know you're all gay?
Surprised it wasn't Foo Fighters or Maroon 5
It's a good choice. They know how to put a show. Look at [this picture](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/sp1JZPL8IYU/maxresdefault.jpg) from their last tour. They gave out glowing LED bands to the audience at all of their shows and this was the result. 
Should have gone with Kanye
You can't talk shit about Coldplay until you've seen them live.

By far one of the best shows I've ever seen.

Should be an awesome performance.
I LOVE COLPLAY I AM SO PUMPED HATERS GONNA HATE LOOK AT THE FUCKING STARS 
I wonder if them being a UK band had any impact on the selection.
^I ^like ^Coldplay

/ducks
Fuck Coldplay. They're probably my most hated band. Their music is so boring and whiny. 
Damn. JJ Watt loves Coldplay but he won't get to see them perform from the locker room :/
From what I've seen the last few years of Superbowl halftime shows turn into, this isn't bad. 

It's been a whose who of whoever can draw a crowd that wouldn't already be there for football, with the occasional add on someone that fits.

From Katy Perry to Madonna to Beyonce, none of which give me the air of "LETS PLAY SOME FOOTBALL" more "LETS GET A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE IN HERE".

Personally I like Coldplay, do I feel its a great match for football, no not even close compared to handful of artists. Do I think this meets both audiences in some football fans and outside entertainment, yes.

I'm figuring that Bruno Mars/RHCP halftime we had was a brief okay in between the current pop star to take the stage. Not to mention theres hope for a Jay-Z appearance with Coldplay performing.
Great, now we can all pretend we're at the dentist while the football stops.
They better play Viva la Vida. That song actually rocks pretty hard.
why is it never Foo Fighters?!?! :(
It's not country music so I can't complain 
Bleh
Well no Taylor Swift. How sexy are Coldplay's legs?
I'll take Coldplay over the Black Eyed Peas, Beyonce, Madonna, and Bruno Mars any day...
I've never listened to/seen them outside their songs big enough to be everywhere. But, [this was pretty cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVr4UP9ntLs). So i'm good. 
Great, another shitty halftime show. Can't wait!!
Still waiting for a Weird Al halftime show.
Meh. There are better pop acts that could have been chosen. And worse.
I'm sure the light show thing will be good.
Better than Adele 
I will stand alone in my desire to bring back dogs doing frisbee tricks. 
They pick the halftime performers to appease the demographic that only watches the Super Bowl for the commercials. 
The halftime show is roughly 30 minutes.  Slayers 'Reign in Blood' is 28:58. You know what to do.
Was hoping for Metallica since its in San Francisco.
Still waiting for Weird Al Yankovic.
I want outkast!
I had a naive thought that maybe they would pick Metallica this year..now I remember what other people listen to.
Better than Bruno Mars AGAIN. I like it.
I hope someone wakes me up before the 3rd
Am I the only one not excited for this, like at all? Seems like a boring half-time show...
They could of had Outkast......
The only Coldplay song I can stand is "Trouble" 
I would have been so happy about this, if it was 2006.
Can't they just say: "Coldplay to show up and move around" at halftime?? Fucking no one actually plays anything at half. It's all lip syncing and audio tracks.
Foo fighters would be great for the superbowl
I won't watch the halftime show until they get GWAR to play it.
they are going to roll out jay-z/rihanna to perform lost +/princes of china. i mean they almost have to 
Coldplay is cool but I was really hoping for Rammstein.
GWAR!
Should've been Whitesnake IMO
Another halftime show spent out back by the BBQ. Perfect. 
I guess Steel Panther was busy? :( ^a ^man ^can ^dream..
I've never been a fan, but they have the type of artistry to knock it out of the park.
I'm starting a petition to get Cannibal Corpse for next year's halftime show.

Who's with me?
I guess I'm a terrible human being for liking Coldplay? Even if you don't like them, they put on great shows
I hope they perform their game of thrones musical.
Another terrible choice picked soley to placate midwest and southern white America.
Maybe next year, Death Grips. Maybe next year...
Can we please start, Thanks Goddel, in place is Obama?
Oh my god, I would be super stoked if this was 2003.!!!!!!
I'm waiting for T-Swift to get a SB halftime show one day so then my Girlfriend is forced to watch football with me. 
Well that will keep the party going...  Worst fucking choice ever
Metallica offered to play it and the NFL opts for Coldplay?   F'n idiots
Goddamn was hoping for KDot and J Cole
Still waiting for Kanye
In the immortal words of Noel Fielding:

"Their manager texted me and said "*I know it's very, you know, cool to hate Coldplay.*" So I texted her back: "*Just wanna say...I wasn't trying to be cool. I genuinely hate Coldplay.*""
I'll be honest, I hate Coldplay so much I might actually skip halftime. It's not just a typical dislike... I fucking can't stand them.
Oh no
When you play your best and you don't succeed

When you get yards you want but not yards you need

When you feel too tired to throw it deep

Is it a curse?

And the tears come streaming down your face

When you lose a ring you can't replace

When you call good plays, but they go to waste

Could it be worse?

Fans will guide you home

And ignite your bones

And I will try for ring two.

"Ring Two", by Coldpleyton Manning
Why not just pick real radiohead instead of fake radiohead?
You know how I know Roger Goodell's gay?
Fuck the haters I love Viva La Vida the whole album. I would absolutely love it if they played Chinese Sleep Chant even though they most likely won't.
Hey NFL Executives: you know how I know you're gay?
I wasn't trying to fall asleep during half time.
Was Coldplay the only band they could get to pay to play?  I don't hate Coldplay but it seems like they are on the downswing and would pay for this opportunity to go back into the national spotlight/market.
RIP hopes and dreams of a T-Swift halftime show
There are going to be so many chimpanzees. 
How many fuckin halftime performers are we getting every week its some new shit
I was hoping for the Grateful Dead since Super Bowl 50 - Dead 50th anniversary.  Maybe the NFL asked and Bob Weir told them to fuck off.

I know a few people that saw them and they said John Mayer is amazing--even people that didn't like John Mayer.
Call me when Scandal gets the halftime gig. Otherwise I'll be using that time to go to the bog and then stock up on drinks.
I'm not upset cause I don't like Cold Play.  I just don't feel they have the energy to be a half time hit.  Their set can't be that exciting and even if the main reason is to get the nondemographic people to watch..Why would they care?  I can't imagine them being entertaining.  
My favorite halftime show at NFL games are the frisbee dogs. Just a guy throwing a frisbee real far and a bunch of dogs chasing them. 
This was what I was secretly hoping for.  Coldplay and the Strokes as a longshot. Arcade Fire would have been great as well.
Bring back the Bud Bowl!
I'm ok with this.  I wish Black Sabbath would go out with a bang tho and do the SB halftime show.  It would never in a million years happen, but a man can dream.
[MRW](http://i.imgur.com/tqzGqEg.jpg)
This is about to be so hidden since I'm late, but I've been giving my best friend shit since last year because he said "You see Katy Perry is doing the halftime show? Should have been coldplay" and now its fucking happening. 
They always manage to pick the perfect mediocre and dated act. 
Fuuuck nooooo
"People like Coldplay and voting for the Nazis. You can't trust people, Jeremy." - SuperHans
I guess Coldplay can chill out the crowd, who should be irate due to the awful traffic mess they will need to endure to get to and from the game.
At least it wasn't Adele.

Coldplay isn't so bad.  I don't really care who plays the halftime show anymore.  It's always just going to be some Pop Rock artist now that I don't care for or listen to.
Was hoping for Taylor Swift 
0/10 not foo fighters

...I like Coldplay. 
Fine but I vote for Cole and Kendrick for 2017.
Still waiting on my weird al Superbowl.  But I'm OK with this, they're great on stage with their shows
I want Bruno Mars back.
I just realized how much the internet has ruined me. I felt disgusted the instant I read this. Then I had to remind myself I've literally never heard a Coldplay song in my life.....and now I need to go sit down and evaluate which beliefs are mine and which are the one's I've been told to have....
Atleast a rock band. 
T-Swift is universally loved.  I'm sure she was in the conversation.

Foo Fighters scream "contact-sport rock".

I like early Coldplay. However, they don't have a track that really connects with the competition-sports world.  
WHERE THE FUCK IS WEIRD AL GOAT HALF TIME SHOW EVER HE WOULD LITERALLY ROCK EVERYONES DICK OFF. LONG LIVE THE VICAR OF YORK! ACCORDIONS FOR LYFE 
"We don't have domestic violence image issue in the NFL. See there's Coldplay right there!" 
Damn. I was hoping for Nickelback. 
Why not just have a normal halftime like every other football game? Whoever cares who plays halftime should not be watching the game. 
Who cares... they never put anything on the Halftime show that's worth watching anyway.
I really don't see them as a hood fit for the half time show. I'm actually really surprised Taylor Swift isn't doing it. 
I read the title as Coldplay to save the halftime show at Super Bowl 50.
Incredibly disappointed it's not going to be Tay-Tay but this is a great consolation prize.
Because if there's any band that comes to mind when I think of football, it's Coldplay

Seriously can we get some better bands for the SB? The RHCP half time show was one of the best I can remember in a long time
This makes me so happy
this is a decision where, it's not my first choice but im also okay with it. We do need to get a good hip hop act up there, as a main act. Eminem, Kanye, and T.I. have all expressed interest in the last few years, to name a few. 
SO underwhelming 
Oh cool, now we can all fall asleep during half time.
i love coldplay
They should have gotten Taylor Swift
GET PHARRELL
I prefer a marching band. Or better yet scrap the show altogether and have a regular length halftime.
Dammit every year I get my hopes up for a Led Zep reunion halftime show. 

...soon...
I sincerely hope they at least tried to call Dave Grohl first.
Does anyone have goodell's email adress? i wanna send him a pic of me flipping him off for making such a shitty decision. seriously? who the fuck likes coldplay? is this some ploy to get the NFL more popular in the UK?
Not even Coldplay will make me forget all the bad calls that are bound to happen.
I'm pretty happy about this.  I would much rather listen to Coldplay than any of the artists kids are listening to these days.

Is current pop music *truly terrible* or am I just getting old?  I know every generation hates the music of the generation that comes after them, but I can't even listen to the Top 40 radio station anymore...
Run the Jewels bitches
Bunch of whiners, here. Talk about first world problems.  Enjoy the game, have a beer and make conversation with friends and family, feed your fat face and stfu.  If you wanted a different band, get a degree in media get a job with a network and make it happen yourself.  The irony of football fans having thin-skin is ridiculous.  Park your American ass on that couch and complain on Reddit until you feel better about something arbitrary.
Maybe next year Kanye and Taylor ;_;
Why would they pick the Radiohead wannabes instead of actual fucking Radiohead
Guess I'm checking out the puppy bowl.
ITT: **Opinions.** Let's try to keep that in mind, children.
I guess rap is too edgy for them.
Shouldn't it say attend? Don't they not let them plug in their instruments or was that only one time?
Wonder if they'll rip off a previous halftime show like they do on everything else.
It's okay Taylor... there's still next year
Well fuck
People still watch the halftime show?
Waiting for Kanye.
I must be old - Who the hell is Coldpay?
Booooooooooooooo
I really hate the half-time music selection at superbowls recently... :/
well this sucks
Yawn.
At least fans will have something else to complain about other then the refs blowing...
Ew...
why the fuck
Neat, I like Coldplay. I like football.

I am satisfied.
fucking BULLSHIT man
Terrible choice
Gross 
As long as it's not Adele. I'd rather watch a Wiggles halftime show.
Zzzzzzzzzzzz
Blehhhhhhh.
Lame!
Where is the metallica half time show everyone wants?
Nothing like catching an overated pop band on the downswing of their career.
#BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NFL YOU SUCK
I hope the power goes off before halftime this year.
Was gonna downvote, then realized OP isn't the one who signed them to the show...

Downvote NFL.
Great. My suicidal 45 year old gay brother is gonna be thirled.
Hey Roger...you know how I know you're gay...

...you allowed Coldplay to play in the Super Bowl halftime show
Worst news on /r/NFL ever...
Ewwwwwww
Fuck
AC/DC or METALLICA would of been the right thing to do. Especially for fucking superbowl 50!!! I'm very disappointed. WHO THE FUCK IS COLDPLAY???
Was everyone else not available?
Oh God no. 
Spying, bounty, and deflated ball scandals. That was bad.

Concussions. That's awful.

Terrible officiating and controversial catch/no-catch rules. These things make football fans' blood boil.

But this... *this* cannot be forgiven. I'm done with the NFL.
Lame.
Gag
Please no.
omg Coldplay sucks
oh god why?
Eh  
It's alright, I guess
Well, I guess it could have been worse.
Crazy good football music. Yeah! /s
I recommend that some of you watch videos from their Mylo Xyloto tour (example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JficYgaK8j8; skip to 3:50). Coldplay puts on a damn good show with great production values. Their newer stuff since Viva La Vida has been very stadium friendly.
"You know how I know you're gay? You like Coldplay" - Paul Rudd
The halftime show will probably be around 2:30-3 AM for me, and I will have just come back from a Friday - Sunday wedding. I won't make it to the second half I'm afraid.
if we're talking early 2000's coldplay im hyped
Better than Bruno Mars 
Because everyone is 5-5.
While true, pretty sure a lot of Packers fans feel like this, Monty Python style:

------------------------------------------------------

**Offseason Reaper:** Bring out yer eliminated.

**Offseason Reaper:** Bring out yer eliminated.

**Offseason Reaper:** Bring out yer eliminated.

*Vikings, Lions, and Bears drag out a struggling Packers team*

**Vikings:** Here's one.

**Offseason Reaper:** That'll be ninepence.

**Packers:** We‚Äôre not eliminated.

**Offseason Reaper:** What?

**Vikings:** Nothing. There's your ninepence.

**Packers:** We‚Äôre not eliminated.

**Offseason Reaper:** 'Ere, they say they‚Äôre not eliminated. 

**Lions:** Yes they are.

**Packers:** We‚Äôre not.

**Offseason Reaper:** They aren‚Äôt.

**Vikings:** Well, they will be soon, they‚Äôre pretty bad.

**Packers:** We‚Äôre getting better.

**Lions:** No you're not, we beat you in Lambeau.

**Offseason Reaper:** Well, I can't take them like that. It's against regulations.

**Packers:** We don‚Äôt want to miss the playoffs.

**Lions:** Oh, don't be such a baby. 

**Offseason Reaper:** I can't take him.

**Packers:** We‚Äôre going to be fine.

**Vikings to the Reaper:** Oh, do us a favor.

**Offseason Reaper:** I can't.

**Lions:** Well, can you hang around for a couple of weeks? They won't last long.

**Offseason Reaper:** I promised I'd head to the NFC East. They‚Äôve lost 3 this week.

**Lions:** Well, when's your next round?

**Offseason Reaper:** Week 15.

**Packers:** We did beat the Vikings last week.

**Lions:** You're not fooling anyone, you know. 

**Vikings to the Bears:** Isn't there anything you could do?

**Packers:** I feel happy! Lacy is back! Everything is going to be fine!

*Bears beat the Packers in Lambeau, on Thanksgiving, on the night they retired Favre‚Äôs number.  Packers nation collectively die inside.*

*Bears, Lions, and Vikings throw the Packers on the Reaper‚Äôs cart*

**Vikings:** Ah, thank you very much.

**Offseason Reaper:** Not at all. See you on Week 15.  Ill be back for those two.

*Reaper points at the Lions and Bears*

**Vikings:** Right.

Here is when the first team was eliminated each year since the current playoff format:

[](/OAK)'14 Raiders: Week 11

[](/ATL)'13 Falcons: Week 12

[](/KC)'12 Chiefs: Week 12

[](/IND)'11 Colts: Week 12

[](/CAR)'10 Panthers: Week 12

[](/STL)'09 Rams: Week 12

[](/DET)'08 Lions: Week 11

[](/MIA)'07 Dolphins: Week 11

[](/OAK)**'06 Raiders: Week 13**

[](/HOU)'05 Texans: Week 12

[](/MIA)'04 Dolphins: Week 11

[](/JAC) '03 Jaguars: Week 12 (By 3 hours)

[](/CIN) '02 Bengals: Week 12
So there's a chance?
Another way of saying the wildcard teams are pretty weak
Whoever did the math must have forgotten the Chargers were an NFL team this year, and I frankly can't blame them. 
Hey speaking of, is this subreddit gonna stop being for babies and fade flairs when teams are eliminated from contention? All the other subs do it and it's fun, don't get why this sub doesn't do it
Let's be honest. Dallas is eliminated. 
Lol tell that to Mike McCoy
##TitansAreGoingToTheSuperBowl
They say that but I feel like the Eagles just got eliminated a couple days ago.
KILL ME! I'M HERE! COME ON! DO IT NOW! KILL ME!!!!
I really, really want the Lions to make it in. Their schedule seems pretty doable to win out, and would be fucking crazy if they could get in. And if they got a playoff win? 

Cooter will be God himself in Detroit. 
&gt; No *NFL* team

I get it we suck
We're helping!
Does anyone know the longest it's possible to go without a team being eliminated?
SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S STILL A CHANCE? ^^/s
You're welcome, Titans.
So 5 weeks and 1 day of relevant football left to play? Yes please. 
I for one have accepted that my flair will be faded next week. 
Jaguar! We are counting on you!

J A G U R A S 
Thanks, NFC East!
Dare I say, even the Browns?
according to that guy's christmas trees that's almost 10 years!!!!
You say parity, I say mediocrity.
Thanks to the cowboys and eagles, my otherwise inconsistent team is still alive!
So everybody else is trash, except the Patriots/Panthers of course.
Just fade our flairs already... I'm done lol 
Man a lot of teams suck this year :(
The Niners were eliminated the day they gave Harbaugh his walking papers...

Last season.
If I read ONE more post on here about how the Cowboys still aren't out of it, I'm done!
Well.....mathematically anyways
Mathematically, no, but, please let me assure you that we are done for the year.  You may fade the flare at your leisure.
so what are the odds for a Cowboy- Browns Super Bowl?
I keep saying this over and over. This has been, from a level of play standpoint, one of the worst football seasons I have ever seen. Just shitty execution week after week after week, with even shittier officiating.

From a competition standpoint it's great, everyone is alive, but the play itself has been almost unilaterally putrid.

My Jets are 5-5 and not a single one of those games, wins or losses, has been what I would describe as "good football." The Pats game came the closest, in that we got 3+ solid quarters, but then the Jets folded like a wet newspaper.

Maybe the stretch run will elevate play, but if the garbage we saw on Thanksgiving is any indication probably not...
WE CAN STILL WIN THIS GUYS!
There are several teams, including SD...that are already dead in the water.....like already bloated, and green. 




We're not eliminated. But we are lol
So you're telling me there's a chance....
Not even the Lions in 08 or Dolphins in 07?
The NFC East is all so terrible this year we might as well get together and play some rock paper scissors to settle the rest of this season. It would probably be more exciting too.
We're still in it bitches!
So you're saying there's a chance!
Statistically, sure. But dear lord my hopes died long, *long* ago.
Even us?!
Yeeeeee! Go Bolts!
Can't we do anything right?!?
who has the best match ups this week? Picking OAK over TEN 
The Chargers may not be eliminated, but they'll go down trying.
So you're telling me there's a chance...
Can we just fade the NFL logo, then?
What has to happen for Dallas to be eliminated?  That's all I care about. 
Maybe not mathematically, but emotionally, it's a different story.
Thats mostly because the AFC is %80 dumpster fire
Parody, bitch!
Wow!!! Since 2006?!?!? That's like.... since literally FOREVER!!!
FUCK YEAH. NINERS GOT A CHANCE BABY!!! WOOOOOI
Just fade me already damn. 
Hah, thats what you think!  
Challenge accepted
YEAHHHHHHHH
So we have a chance
Aren't the Saints out of it?
Not familiar with the NFL elimination process can someone explain?
Good day to put up some christmas lights. "Hey looks at me honey, I am even skipping football to put up the lights!"
I beg to differ. The Dolphins shot us in the chest, the Buccs tied us up and put us in a trunk, the Lions drove us over a bridge and next week the Pats will make sure all the evidence of murder is burned and never allowed to come to light.
Not officially, but we're donzo.
Eh, still get chance!
I'm surprised the Browns have made it this long.
My Jags still have a shot guys! This feels amazing!
I would love to know the flip side. How many teams can sit out all their starters and lose every game and still make the playoffs?
WE STILL IN IT BOYS #JEDYORKFORPRESIDENT
Isn't this the parity that NFL wanted except what they got was a couple of powerhouses and everyone else in a long distant second place.

So you're telling me there's a chance...
I hope this leads to an insanely fun week 17.
Meh it's over for us
So...you're saying the league is constipated and having trouble eliminating?
Come watch the playoff picture Titans tomorrow in the pouring 50 degree rain!
So we still have a chance?
Parity in the NFL?  I don't buy it.
That was the year Green Bay went 8-8. Why did you make me remember that?
So you're saying there's a chance? 
Even my jaguars?! What a time to be alive
So you're saying there's a chance
Browns have won the super bowl! 
10-2 Chargers back in 2006, good times...
9ers are done. 
Well fuck, that's pretty insane what kind of season we're having this year.
#TITAN UP
Soon we will be .500 too!
Im calling it right now. 

Chargers-Eagles. Super Bowl 50.

In no way is my prediction far fetched.
Lol k. Both teams Monday night are going to eliminate via a tie
Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha...

....ahahahahahahahahahahaha...

...*cries*... please.
I think Dallas eliminated themselves about 8 weeks ago.
So you're telling me there's a chance?
2006!?  Wow that's a long time ago!  I mean, people still had iPods and Rick and Morty didn't even exist!  lol 
I don't know, we've pretty much been eliminated for a while
Oh no, we were definitely eliminated 
what?
The football has been really shitty this year. Looks like the NFL has to tweak more rules to make it easier for quarterbacks. 
I do hope some of the younger players take this incident to heart. Even this guy with his iron man rep will take concussions seriously. So should you. 
Kind of rude to call the reporter a butt brain, but that's really noble and brave of him to play through any injury.
Smart. I remember when Hines Ward gave him shit for not playing with a concussion. It was a big game and Ben still sat out. Doesn't matter how tough you are, brain damage is irreversible. 

*Edit - For those asking when that happened:
&gt;"I could see some players or teammates questioning, like 'it's just a concussion. I've played with a concussion before.' It's almost like a 50-50 toss up in the locker room. Should he play? Shouldn't he play? It's really hard to say."

&gt;"I've lied to a couple of doctors saying I'm straight, I feel good when I know that I'm not really straight," he told NBC. "I don't think guys really worry about the future while they're playing currently in the NFL."

[link](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2009/11/hines-ward-steelers-locker-room-split-50-50-on-whether-ben-roethlisberger-should-have-played/1#.Vl3v4narSCg)
That's a great policy to have. I wish more players would have it
Big Ben better should probably consider not playing Sunday. You know, to be sure. Super duper sure.
meanwhile wes welker is wondering how he ended up in st. louis.
Good on Ben for telling his coaches. 

Honest question here: does Ben take himself out of the game (in your opinion) if the gap was only one score? The gap when he took himself out was 9 points; it was pretty unlikely they were going to be able to pull off a comeback even if he stayed in. Does anyone think that might have played a part in his decision-making? 
I think he figured out that concussions are serious after the playoff game last year.  I think he went out for a concussion and then came back to throw like two picks.
Says the dude that doesnt wear a helmet when he rides a motorcycle... 
I would take this more seriously if it wasn't for that wild card game last year.
i'm convinced ben roethlisberger sustained some kind of TBI on that motorcycle
"I'll play through ANY injury, *BUTT-BRAIN*!"

Reporter: 'How can I spin this?'
Considering that he's played through ankle injuries, knee injuries, broken ribs, broken nose, a cracked jaw, who knows how many broken fingers, had a bunch of teeth replaced, and played a few days after having his appendix removed, I hope this illustrates how serious he takes hits to the head.
What about spine?
That sentence makes it sound he already has played through brain once or twice.
I knew he was one tough s.o.b. But as bad as I'm sure he wants to play, he is incredibly smart for knowing better. Good for him.
The bad news is he said this while wearing his underwear over his pants.
butt brain
Except for the end of that drive
I do like the fact that if the Independent Doctor calls for a concussion timeout in the final 2 minutes of the 2nd/4th quarter, the team is not charged a timeout. I mean if I was a receiver and got a concussion with 30 seconds left down 4, I would do anything not to cost my team that 10 seconds or an important timeout, so now that is not a worry. 
They obviously misformatted that.

&gt;I'll play through any injury, butt-brain!
 His brain is probably already gonna show CTE when they carve him up. Still, it's a good message and awareness. 
...except that time he did in the playoffs last year.
Shocking that Roethlisberger had to be the one to remove himself from the game. There was a hit to the head, a penalty called where the ref explicitly stated that he was hit in the head, he stayed on the ground for an extended period after the play was over, and then he just got up and kept playing. How did no one, from the PITT trainers to the guy employed by the NFL whose only job is to detect potential concussions, to the officials, think that maybe we should take a look at this guy?

And then he's conveniently pulled right after they go down 2 scores with very little time left.
This is good to hear.
Smarter guy than I gave him credit for.
Anybody against him doing that is such a moron... lol even if it was the Super Bowl.
This tweet brought to you by Roger Goodell and the letters N, F, and L.
http://www.theonion.com/article/teammates-pretty-sure-ben-roethlisberger-can-no-lo-6521
I'm not his biggest fan but good on him. A broken bone will heal, your brain might not. 
I have a feeling that concussion during that playoff game last year didn't sit to well with his family.
If that's the way he worded it, it may be too late. 
Tell the truth!
News article "Big Ben gives up, takes himself out of the game!"

Way to let your fans down, hope you don't miss playoffs due to that loss.
i see people all of the time saying those who don't make as much / not as talented risk themselves by playing through more injuries but I don't get it really. even at the low end, you're making millions of dollars. the average american will never see $1,000,000 in their life time.. if they're just smart about their money, a few million is more than enough to supplement them their whole life
Hey, Beavis. You said butt brain.....huh huh huh huh
I 100% agree with Ben that a head injury is not something to play through.  Ask Bret Farve or Troy Aikmen about their memory issues from playing with head/brain injuries.  

But Damn it,  I'm scraping rock bottom to find a replacement QB in my Fantasy League this week after Romo's shoulder and now Ben's brain got injured this week.  
So Ben Roethlisberger *will* accept No as an answer?
A 15 yard penalty and a fine is all he'll face for hitting Ben in the head. Seems worth it to me if you can knock the starting QB out of a game.
Smart. I hope others follow. 
Good for him.

The league can take all the protective measures they want but I think self-policing is much more effective.
Such a weird way of saying it.  I use "brain" in another connotation, amiriteoramirite?
Oh no!  He is a zombie now!
grahm gronkowski charles lynch foster and to so many others get welll soon
Good for him.  If I was a player I would feel the same way.  Brain injurys are not something to mess with.
Good. You can't just get a new brain like you can get hip/knee replacements. Smart long term move. There's life after football to think about 
manning is a brain to the head kindve guy
I dont blame him. Id do the same if I was in his shoes. 
Ben's just exicted because THE MCRIB IS BACK!!!!
any injury but brain, and a torn MCL
Smart man. He's tough as nails but you don't fuck with the brain. It's not about pain tolerance at that point, it's about valuing your own life and future.
Damnit Brian
I'd say definitely the right decision. You can live with arthritis but not with a mushy brain. 
"I'm brain through any injury but play."
hate big ben but you gotta respect him for this. plenty of people would have played through something like this. hopefully more people follow suit in the future instead of causing further injury to themselves
I remember when he finished a game against the ravens with a broken nose so bad he looked like Owen Wilson
...except for the brain injury he's considering playing through next week
I'll play through any injury, butt brain
I've always been amazed at how many injuries this guy plays through, but he is totally right about taking brain related injuries more carefully.
[deleted]
If that was true, he wouldn't have every played in the first place. BOOM ZING!
[deleted]
Bro.. Just rub some dirt on it....
Didn't he finish the series after the injury? 
Good thing that giant potato is indestructible.
Ben is a legend
He is arguably the toughest player in the nfl.
"I'll play through anything. I don't need your consent." -Ben Roethlisberger
He meant to say pain. But he was severely concussed.
Smart dude 
I hate Ben Roethlisberger, but I respect this quote/stance. I gained some respect for him for this. 
What a pussy.
too late ben.
Including injury to his reputation.
I seem to recall in a game recently where Ben was playing and obviously got his bell rung and kept playing. The next few plays you could clearly see he wasn't all there. I hate the Steelers but I felt really sad seeing him play with what looked like a TBI. 
This too coincidental with that concussion movie...nah idk....I'm just a conspiracy theorist
IN THE NFL NEWS TODY BY ME       IF YOU HAVE MORE WINS THAN LOSSES YOUR LOOKING ALRIGHT


Ben Roethlisberger now: "I only said that on account of my concussion. I'm Big Motherfucking Ben, where's my helmet?"
Too bad he didn't have this attitude in the playoffs last year when he was obviously concussed, came back into the game and promptly threw a game-killing interception in the end zone.  At least he's learning!
Pussy
I heard he went out because the fans were so loud.

The NFC has six teams at 4-5, all trying to creep up on a wildcard spot (Currently Packers/Falcons at 6-3).
I thought the 1990 season went pretty well up until the end.  
This is exciting football.  When so many teams still have a chance it's way more fun.  
Buffalo Bills to the Superbowl confirmed
Is it weird that even the really good teams don't feel that good?

Like, we Vikings are 7-2, but *man* have we played some ugly games.  And I don't even mean our season opener blowout loss to the 49ers--even our wins are ugly.

The Panthers are also winning ugly games.  Cam has thrown some ugly passes, and his receivers are terrible.

And the Packers, who were a top 2 team all year, just lost at home to the Lions in a game both teams tried their best to lose.

The Broncos look amazing, but expectations for Kubiak's run game have never panned out, and Peyton was just benched after one of the worst QB performances in the last decade.

And just when I was thinking the Bengals are so well put together, they lose to the Texans and everyone looks terrible.

Even the Patriots don't feel like this historically good undefeated team.  And it's not just the injuries, or Brady's relatively bad game last week, but the cornerbacks (Butler aside) and personnel.

Maybe I'm too critical?
And the Giants are the only team right in the middle at .500 üò™
It's like the Pac-12 this year
And in 1990 there were only what, 28 teams?

No Ravens, Jags, Panthers or Texans.

I wonder when the last time there was only 10 teams with a winning record in that era was.
It probably also has a little to do with how the scheduling worked out. A lot of top teams have their divisional games stacked in this second half. Those are games that tend to bring a little more balance between wins and losses. It seems like aside from the top 3 maybe 4 teams, most of the league could sit on about .500 give or take 1-2 games. I can only recall one team (Atlanta) that jumped out really far ahead and is slowly drifting back to the norm (where they probably actually stand as far as overall talent). Usually there are more teams that can "pretend" through the first half of the year. All in all, I wouldn't rush to judgement that the league is imbalanced this year as we have had a ton of upsets already and there is still a lot more football left to play.
It's a very top-heavy league this season.

I'm remembering all of those "NFL parity" circles where each team has beaten a team who's beaten a team etc... I wonder if this year it will be impossible to complete one of those. Obviously right now with 2 unbeaten teams it is.
Top 11!
Highest number of undefeated teams late in the season and the fewest teams with a winning record kind of go hand in hand
This is the problem that I've had with everyone saying "who have the Panthers beat" or any team for that matter...it's hard to get quality wins when NO ONE is winning other than like 5 teams. Like there was the Patriots, Broncos, Panthers, Packers, and Bengals all undefeated and then everyone else was just bad or mediocre.
Its crazy how mediocre the league is this year. ANY team I feel like can win the Superbowl if they get hot at the right time and make it. Thats why I am hoping the Steelers can hold on, I feel like we can beat any team this year.
But, guys, remember, let's expand the playoffs!
It almost feels like a college season, with so many undefeated teams so late, and so many teams with 1 or 2 losses.
So youre saying theres a chance
its been a weird season. LOTS of injuries, and teams  loosing key players for multiple games (QB's) and some good QB's and players struggling. I think the combo of this and good teams elevating their play has made a discrepancy in the records. 

I was looking at team stats. we got teams like the panthers with NO pass game. but are getting red zone TD with them.

Patriots on the other end of the spectrum with no run game, but are gettind TD in the red zone with them.

The efficiency of these teams in the red zone maybe?
Horray now I don't feel so bad!
Not sure if that means that the NFL is balanced really well or that there is a large quality gap between those that are OK and those that are really good. 
So parity is better than ever. This is a good thing.
AND THE BILLS ARE ONE OF THEM!!!!! 
and one of them is the Jets?

what a time to be alive
betting this year has been fucked
Wild card team with a losing record is going to win the super bowl
The NFL is wild, man. Wasn't it a few years ago where there were so many winning teams they had to add extra playoff games? It's crazy.
From a gambling/fantasy/pool perspective I feel like this year and the current parity in the league this is what separates the men from the boys. 

Like me:  I've learned how terrible I am with my picks.


I feel like every team can win on any given Sunday (thu or mon). 

I feel like the so called experts are even like 50% of their picks this year.

It's chaos and I love it. 
Obviously an NFL expansion is needed, more teams means more teams with winning records.
When was the last time an entire division entered week 11 with losing records?
That's because like half the league is either 4-5 or (recently) undefeated.
"Parity"
**CHAOSSSS**
The NFL is pretty much like America right now.  The top team is doing historically well and there are more teams on the bottom doing much worse then they have in a long time.
I forget were 6 and 4, because with the amount of notable name injuries weve had it feels like were 2 and 8. 
And 12 teams make the playoffs. So at this point we'd have a team with a losing record in.
Since there there are more losing teams the Browns own the first pick. This could be good. Hoping Manziel pans out there are some things that could happen with this pic. Can't wait
So are all the teams roughly the same level of bad, or the same level of good?
True this season has seemed to have more shit-shows and clown fiesta games than previous seasons. Personally, I love seeing 2 shit teams play it out cause its usually a high scoring game, but even that isn't happening too often this season. 
The season has been weird, so it makes sense. 
Any chance the 49ers can still make it? :(
Yay!!! Everyone gets a trophy!!!
Bucs wildcard playoff run 2015
So you're telling me there's a chance!!!
shit ton of 4-5 teams now
Wouldn't this make sense, as a result of all the team that went undefeated for so long?
And soon the Bears!!!
So why is this? The rise of importance of the QB and the corresponding lack of elite QB talent? 
I was just thinking this season that there aren't that many truly well rounded teams. Even for the salary cap era, the quality of top dog teams has just dipped in recent memory. At least it feels that way. 
We're 7 and 2.  The sky is not falling!  Brock and Roll!  
What are the odds of having a team with a losing record in the playoffs?
AFC East w/ 3/4 teams above .500. AFC South with 0/4 teams above .500
All season I've been saying "man, football has been hard to watch this year. It feels like there aren't very many good teams ". 

I like it when numbers backup my shitty feelings. 
In other words:  Few very good records (Car, Den, Cin, NE), and lots of mediocre teams trading wins.
The NFL is weird
Good year for the Cardinals to be good. 
The league is ruining our game by trying to legislate the kind of product it wants. To much "D" and they can't help themselves, they have to help the offense at every turn.
I've been thinking for a while that this is the worst football I've seen (league average for this season), not surprised by this stat
and all those big-name powerhouses up there, the NYG, the Cowboys, the Seahawks, the Niners, you know, your traditionally epic teams.  not like the 2000's raiders, Jets, Bengals or Panthers. 

I love football because you never know what you're going to get.


Also noteworthy, six back up QBs are starting in week 11
So you're saying there's a chance...
Oh yeah, well, every team with a winning record is lame. 
TBH there are very few teams that you can say DAMN they are terrible and can't beat any decent teams. there have been so many teams with awful records show signs of life and being able to stay close in games with good teams.
I have this feeling we are going to see Giants-Patriots Part 3 this year.
Which 11?
Par-it-y. Par-it-y. 
Good. In two years we'll go on a superbowl streak, fire garret, get one more freebie, and then tap out for the next twenty years.
Is now a good time to talk about expanding the playoffs to 16 teams? 

Wouldn't it be great if by week 17, the only 2 byes were already locked up, the divisions were all locked up, and the only meaningful games with starters being played involved 7-8 teams against 3-12 teams?
We are part of the 66%
Injuries.
Teams are just really bad this year. There have been Oline injuries, QB injuries and failures, and running back injuries that have set back teams.
Less good quarterbacks, less good teams
This is the result of shit like the salary cap. All the teams are more even; all the teams are mediocre. 
Cleveland right now: https://s3.amazonaws.com/synth3tk/drunk-johnny-superfan.gif
Josh McCown, you did a helluva job.
Not sure how I feel about the words "Scoopage" and "Browns" being in such close proximity to each other
It's definitely time.

McCown far exceeded expectations and took a beating doing it.  I don't think this change is any reflection on him whatsoever.  The bottom line is that McCown is definitely not the future, and we need to see if Johnny has potential (which I think he has already begun to demonstrate) before we draft yet another quarterback in the first round.  Johnny needs the experience and to continue developing so that maybe we can be competitive next year.
[deleted]
I would certainly hope so. He was one of the only bright spots for the Browns this week. I was quite impressed. He kept throwing darts for fairly large gains. I didn't expect that out of him.

He had a few very nice sack escapes, and showed some toughness, especially after that facemask penalty (the exorcist play). Passing was on point for the most part. Overall, definitely the best I've seen out of him.
Can we have McCown?
The first step towards the inevitable '30 for 30' episode: "Johnny, be good: A story of how one young man overcame himself to lead a storied NFL franchise, and a city, back to relevance."
http://imgur.com/B2ZA2zS
It's alright Josh you don't have to play anymore you can close your eyes now
UK fan here. 

I got caught up in the Johnny Football hype last season (I'd never heard of him until the draft) and I stayed for the relentless cycle of hope, despair, futility and pain that comes with supporting the Browns. It's weirdly comforting.

Johnny's fun, he's the first player I've ever really rooted for.
I want Manziel to succeed so badly
God help me, I love me some Johnny Football.
I thought he looked good last game. He passed for almost 400. He had a rushing TD called down at the 1 and ruined by penalties. Travis Benjamin also dropped another TD. He was also sacked 6 times.
He is exciting, I'll give him that.
About time. Let's see what we have in him
Cool, he's fun to watch.
He deserves it after the Steelers game, he played his ass off with almost no support
How did he look last game? I had people telling me he actually looked good, but the score didn't really represent that.
Pettine yesterday: "Given what he's gone through... You're just proud of the kid.... He played his ass off."
Give this man an actual #1 receiver to throw to and he will perform. Barnidge is not enough. 
Can't wait for week 12 when the potentially 2-8 Ravens take on the 2-8 Browns on Monday Night Football.

I can already see Gruden having a field day with that.

He now has two weeks to prep for the biggest 6 games of his life. It's gonna be entertaining no matter how it goes
I don't know if this makes the Browns better but it definitely makes them more fun to watch. 
Fantastic, Pettine sounded over the moon (as over the moon as Pettine can be) after Sunday. He played a great game and was the best player on our offense or defense by far. If he can get some more help from his teammates he might be what we were looking for when we drafted him last year. 

Edit: a word
Good decision.  Props to the Browns for being smart about this.  There's no reason not to see what he can do ROS.  Then you can find out if he can be the guy or if you need to look elsewhere.
I see no downside.

On a completely unrelated matter, are you guys ever getting Josh Gordon back?
This is exactly what needs to happen in order to see what Manziel can do and if he is worth moving forward with. Other the Browns will be picking in the top 3 and could grab a qb

I think this is the right move. Gotta see what you have with your 1st round QB. He has worked hard to get where he is and when given the opportunity he has played fine. 
Well, lets hope that ends the QB drama for the Browns for at least the rest of this season.
Scoopage?
I'm honestly looking forward to this. 

Whether Johnny booms or busts, I think it's time to really see him play to decide if he's really the future, or if they need to start thinking about a new direction.

Though hats off to McCown. He's an excellent team guy who plays with passion and gives his all. I hope he'll stick around as a back up to continue helping Manziel develop, which is a great thing for the Browns.
Johnny looked good in PIT
Finally. He gets a real shot
About time
You go show them Johnny
Color me exited!
He hasn't played bad. That team is just bad.
As an outsider, this is the greatest Cleveland Browns news I've had all day.

All aboard the train to Brown Town!

Wait, that doesn't sound quite right...
god please let this kid be our savior. i fucking love him. we have suffered enough. Johnny be good. 
[deleted]
Hope he does well. If he fulfills his potential, there's going to be a lot of real entertaining football to come
If Manziel plays well, Gordon comes back, Brownies draft Fournette/Henry/Elliott...
First college game I watched was Texas A&amp;M vs Alabama in 2012. Needless to say I really want to see Johnny to succeed in the NFL
Only logical decision, I don't care how well McCown is playing. You need to know if Manziel is the future franchise QB.
Took them long enough.
I was really hoping they would have the same starting qb for a whole season and lift the curse
This only makes sense. The Browns need to see if Manziel can be a competent starting QB in the future. 
With the 1st Pick in the 2016 NFL Draft The Cleveland Browns Select... Nah Just kidding I wish him well...
Aww I'm happy for him. 
I like this move. Honestly I think he can be a serviceable QB. I'd like to see if he can progress to more than that. Dude deserves a chance after he's cleaned up and taken care of his issues while performing well at the same time.
I'm glad.  I like McCown a lot, but he's getting banged up awfully quickly.  Might as well put in Johnny Football to show off a little.
Finally, it's Tebow time!
For now.*  These Cleveland QB's can't stay healthy.
I think he's earned it. Season's pretty much done and Mike Pettine needs to offer a future to the org to keep his job. Manziel has flashed some potential in relief work and the kid has matured a lot since last summer, on field and off, so I think he's earned his shot. TBH manziel talk has kept attention off what should be the real talking point of this team, which is the inexplicable regression of the defence.
That's probably not a bad idea.

Let him get a bunch of experience while you can.

If you want to trade him, you're gonna need some good film.

And if you want to keep him, gotta get some practice in for next season.
Love me some Johnny!

I agree with this, Might as well give him a half season to get seasoned. 
I might have a reason to watch Monday Night Football in two weeks

Go Johnny Go!
.MN wnmmmmpnj7
Bout god damn time

Well, if he struggles, I heard Brandon Weeden is available
Just as long as the offense isn't "customized" to have Manziel run zone read plays that he wasn't even all that great at doing in college let alone the pros ...

Is it even possible to have in the pros these days to have an equivalent of a rolling pocket?  What I have seen is it is possible to pull offensive linemen on pass blocking, but not as extreme as the rolling pockets the likes of Len Dawson or Joe Thiesmann had.
They're doing what I've suggested. Give him a string of games to see what he can do with confidence and if he fails they can say told you so and if he doesn't they don't have to stick him back on the bench. He hasn't played bad by any means. 
Guess it's time to drop Gary Barnidge in my fantasy league...
Hope the Browns atleast give him a legit shot next year. I've been a fan of manziel coming out of college. I really want to see him succeed.
Time to prove himself. Rooting for ya johnny!!
Good, was saying this weeks ago. Browns are going nowhere this season, no reason not to get Manziel in there and develop him. And he's looked a lot better too.
B-E-A-UTIFUL. I am very excited to see him play for the rest of the season.
Whoop! Gig em Browns!
Nowhere to go but up.
So much for the fantasy value of Barnridge
hopefully Manziel can drop the browns off at the Superbowl.
&gt;&gt;scoopage
I hope Johnny Checkdown gets his shit together 
All Hail the Ziel 
Now people can stop bitching on /r/browns. What a glorious day.
Might as well figure out if Johnny Manziel is the future of the team before we draft a QB with the #1 overall pick in the draft. I predict he'll play just well enough that we'll not want to draft a QB, then the guy we *do* draft will be terrible and Johnny will flame out. It just feels Browns-y.
Only in Cleveland can a qb lose to division rivals by 21 points in back to back games and get promoted to the starter.  Only in Cleveland.
Carson Palmer put up an assload of passing yardage against us but was unable to translate into very many points scored.

So... Johnny Manziel = Carson Palmer? Anyone?
As a Steelers fan, I must say he wasn't bad. His offensive line is terrible, and he only has one good receiver and TE , other than that I think he showed promise. 
Correct timing on backup to the slaughter must be observed. 
I hope they cut McCown so he can go to a contender.
Lol.
Nooo barndige sucks when Manziel is in there.

No way he is the starter the rest of the season. The Browns have six games left. He'll get himself hurt again.
The staff and front office are on the chopping block. If Johnny does okay the rest of the year, some guys have a chance to keep their jobs. If Johnny didn't play, or doesn't play well, it's guaranteed that they are all fired.
Adjust fantasy rosters accordingly. 
About time. There are 0 reasons to play McCown. Might as well let Johnny play to see what he's got so they can trade him next year
Pick up whoever is playing the Browns on defense in fantasy 
I can understand the move at this point in the season; however, I don't understand all the hype for a guy who is lucky if he can complete 50% of his passes.
Browns going hard for that number one draft pick I see. 
Now the Browns will lose games by slightly higher margins. I like this move. 
Roll out, look for Benjamin, throw it deep. THIS is Johnny Football is played.
The amount of times I've heard about Manziel being or not being the starter makes me think the Browns are only doing it to stay relevant in NFL news.  Sorry Browns fans :(
RIP Barnidge....it's been good.
I wonder who McCown will get a multi-year contract from next year? He seems like the perfect Jeff Fisher QB. 
How many weeks in a row can this be a story? We get it he is the starter.
Honestly, are the Browns even trying at this point? 
I want to see this punk get cut in two!  I want to see this shithead fail in epic proportions.....I want to see the new Ryan Leaf.  I hope you get your fuckin head ripped off you fuckin shithead.
"ME."
He really is the perfect backup.

- Knows his role on the team

- Doesn't cause any controversy

- Is consistent and reliable when called upon

- Is a veteran QB that has been in the league for a long time and knows how to prepare
Is this really an actual controversy for Colts fans outside of like... Facebook comments and calling into sports radio? (The two sources you should never trust).

Hasselbeck is a great QB, I hope he retires as Seahawk. And it's cool he's still playing well at 40 (take a shot) but there is literally no way you play him over Luck once Luck is healthy. 
"And that man is me."
TL;DR

Veteran player knows his role with team.
I mean this: Matt Hasselbeck makes me want to be a better person.
I have a ton of respect for Hasselbeck. He's a classy dude.
He wants the ball and he's gonna score!
People give Brady a hard time for thinking he can play until he's 45, but when Hasselbeck over here says he's going to do it, nobody bats an eye /s
I love Hasselbeck. Such a good dude. Really enjoyed having him as a QB for a while.
If the NFL had the equivalent of the 6th man award in the NBA, he should get it.
Clipboard Jesus?
"AND HIS NAME IS **JOHN CENA**"
I think the debate about whether Andrew Luck is going back in when he's healthy is pretty stupid.  Of course they will put him back in.

HOWEVER

What if Hasselbeck wins the next 2 games are so, and the Colts are still fighting for that playoff spot, and Luck comes in and lays an egg.  Throws like 3 interceptions and just has a bad game.  What do they do then?
"I want the team and I'm gunna win."
And his name is MATT HASSELBECK
Fuck yeah Matt. Don't give that job back. 
I don't know of any other Colts fans who are saying or thinking if Luck is healthy and ready, HasselGOAT would still get the start. This is just a stupid media driven narrative.

"...and youre looking right at him, motherfucker."
I've still got a Seahawks Hasselbeck jersey that I wear every week. My jersey has never felt so relevant, I hope Hasselbeck wins the Colts at least one playoff game.  
"I want the job and I'm gonna keep it."
Hasselbeck is playing hot this season, and not just for a 40 year old backup QB. His age just makes it all that much more impressive.
I've said it before and I'll say it again. How is it that this guy's been a backup these last few years? Considering how many teams were just a QB away in that time frame, somebody had to have taken a look at the old QB right?
Hasselbeck is an excellent backup, but consider that he's played the Jaguars, Texans before they got their shit together, Falcons after they lost their shit, and Bucs who have a rookie QB.  Luck has played the Jets, Bills, Titans, Patriots, Saints, Panthers, and Broncos.  I'm not sure Hasselbeck could have beaten the Broncos, or taken the Panthers to overtime, or stayed within 1 score of the Patriots.  While the team is relatively solid, it's not good enough to contend for a Super Bowl with a game manager at QB.  I have plenty of confidence in Hasselbeck winning games to secure the division title (or a potential wild card), but Luck gives them a better chance to beat teams like New England, Cincy, and Denver in the playoffs.
Really wish Hasselback would stop talking about himself. Coming off as arrogant. We get it, you're the next Colt great.
Honestly, Hass is my favorite QB in the league besides RW.  Great guy.  I really hope that he somehow comes back to Seattle to coach when he retires.  
Hasselbeck: And we all know its gonna be ME!
If you really think Hasselbeck is going to get the start once Luck is healthy, you know nothing about football.  Hasselbeck is a FANTASTIC backup, but he's old and obviously he's the first one to admit that.

Luck is probably the best QB to come out of the draft  in the last 5 years, there are about 3 teams in the league who wouldn't be after him if they didn't start him.
This is a perfect situation for the Colts. Luck is going to come back healthy and rested while Hasslebeck wins games and there is zero controversy because Matt knows his role as a veteran backup. If Matt was 15 years younger things could have gotten messy.
TEBOW
So much class. 
I remember that one year when he was back on the Seahawks (and tore it up with Alexander) and was at some QB competition. 

He and Peyton Manning were being interviewed at the simultaneously and he acted sheepishly about taking on the competition and just said he was glad to be there. 

Peyton fired back "I'm here to win," or something along those lines. 

I dunno, always cracked me up. 
And that man's name???  

JOHN CENA!!!
This should be the Broncos mindset too... Maybe it's just me hating how Payton is being treated...
I've always liked Hasselbeck. As much as I dislike the Colts, he's been one of my favorite stories this season.
And his name is John Cena!
Hasselbeck is going to play until he's fifty?! /s
Come on home to Uncle Bruce, Andy 
The Colts are so lucky to have someone like Hasselbeck as the backup.  They seemed to learn their lesson after the year of Curtis Painter.
Matt Hasselbeck throwing Andrew Luck under the bus.  I love it.
He alluded to the same thing happening in Seattle. Who were the fans clamoring for there? Seneca Wallace?
We know, It's Sexy Rexy. 
*Andrew Luck awakens in pain in the locker room. He looks around dazed until he sees Hasselback standing over him.*

"Why didn't they just...cut me?"

"You don't fear being cut. You welcome it. Your punishment must be more severe."

"Benching?"

"Yes. But not because you're injured. Because I'm better."

"What is this place?"

"Home. Where I learned the truth of despair. Every Back-up Quarterback that has rotted here over the season has looked onto the field and imagined leading the team to victory and starting. So easy. So simple. And like Johnny Manziel trying to stay sober, many failed trying. I learned that there can be no true hope without despair. So. As I lead the Colts to victory, I will give you hope to poison your soul. I will let you believe that you can recover so that you can clamber to stay in the sun. I will make an entire city believe. And when it is done. And the Colts are mine. Then you have my permission to be cut."
Sunken cost fallacy. Hasselbeck is too old to be any team's long term option, but if the superbowl is tomorrow and they're both healthy, I'm still going Hasselbeck. Some of their fan comments are ridiculous. Are you an Andrew Luck fan or an Indianapolis Colts fan?
Whitehurst?
THE HASSEL IS BACK!
[Let's prepare him so that he can play in the league for 40 more years](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/archer-technology1.jpg?quality=80&amp;w=650)
He wants the ball and he's gonna win
He must plan on playing till 50 talking like that 
Matt Hasselbeck?
Houston fan here. I'll give him a shot. 
Hasselback being a true veteran, wonder if he can handle starting for other teams.
"and then after practice, Coach gave us juice boxes!"
I actually played against Hasselbeck in High School, in 1992.  That was a long frigging time ago and no idea how he can still be doing it.
Hasselbeck actually went to the California Maritime Academy for a semester before he transfered and played football at BC. Being a student here I always thought that was cool. Got love for the guy
If colt fans are really complaining about Luck, the Rams will gladly take him!
Don't Hassel The Beck.
Um duh..who asked this? Idiot media member? There's no qb controversy in Indy  lol 
used to dislike matt a lot when he played for seattle. Somehow, I am starting to really like him as a player and as a personality.
I (Broncos fan) had this conversation with my mother (Colts fan) last night. I explained to her why there's no way Luck isn't the starter when he's healthy. 

I do think that if Osweiler continues to improve, Manning's playing days may be over. Yes, he's great, but if our young QB is playing well, we should roll with it IMO. 
Uh. Obviously it's GOATT Hasselbeck
I always liked Matt Hasselbeck. Better than average quarterback knew his limits and won despite never playing with a true number 1 wide receiver. 
"Me."
He's talking about Luck, does no one have reading comprehension skills?
Is it him?
Spot on Matty. HASSLEGOAT for the next 10 years Indy get Hype
Wow how much longer is he planning on playing?!
And his name is John Gena!
John Cena?
Best backup qb
AND HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!!!

dun duh duh duuuh
Plot twist: Tim hasselbeck
Reminds me of all the Cutler/McClown talk in 2013 in Chicago.
And his name is????
This reminds me of McCown's last year with the Bears. 4 solid games but Cutty is our QB
Damn! He's a cocky son of a bitch!
Jared Goff?
So he's pretty confident that he has stolen the job. 
this would be like playing a 35 year old qb over a 1st round draft pick 
Matt Hasselbeck
If only someone could have explained this to Bears fans 2 years ago.
I like this guy
[Yes we do, Matt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Am4oKAmc2To)
And in other news water is still wet
[oh](http://i.imgur.com/fk157FF.png)

And his wife is smoking fine. Lucky SOB
But Matt, Andrew doesn't want the ball and he doesn't want to score. 
"And that's me, bitches. Pechanec, thanks for helping me out with Andrew. I hope his beard wasn't too much for you to handle."
Matt gives hope to us not quite good looking, bald, middle age guys.
"I want the starting job and I'm gonna win"
People looking at the QB wins stat will say "wow, Hasslebeck is playing better than Luck, should we ride the hot hand?" But, looking into the stats at all [it is clear Luck has been playing better than Hasslebeck](http://www.stampedeblue.com/2015/11/30/9822124/should-the-colts-stick-with-matt-hasselbeck-at-quarterback-over-andrew-luck) as he has slightly better stats against much better defenses (remember- 3 of Luck's 5 losses this year were against the Bills, Jets, and Patriots, and he beat the Broncos- that is 4 of the top 10 defenses in the league). 
Yeah, I feel like we have put the cart before the horse with Luck. He could just as easily be a Matt Stafford or Jay Cutler, than a Brady or Manning. Personally I think Stafford is the floor, and a Romo or  Palmer, or Rivers is more realistic than Brady. That's still a franchise QB. I just wish people would stop with the super elite expectations. 
Wait, there are people who actually think Hasselbeck is talking about himself now. Hahaha 
The only people I know of who want Luck to sit the rest of the year are my brother's super racist friends. 
Hasselbeck says something non-controversial and fairly obvious?  Better drug test him.  
I'm crazy and I'm on drugs, and I also think the 49ers should go after Hasselbeck and Holmgren in the offseason.

Suck it, Seahawks. SUCK IT

Spoken words of a true, humble, back-up champion. 
He says that, but as a coach you have to ride the hot hand. I'm a jets fan so I'm not following the colts closely, so idk when Luck is supposed to come back, but if Hasslebeck is playing great and the team is winning, you can't go back to luck just because he was the starter when the season opened.
Hasselbeck is the perfect BACKUP quarterback, but let's be honest there was a reason we got rid of him for of all people Tarvaris Jackson. He just doesn't have the stamina anymore for a season long starting gig, and after a while he started becoming injury prone.  I'm happy that he's found a hot streak when the Colts needed him the most, but I pray that Luck comes back before that streak inevitably ends.
Peyton Manning

wait did I miss something
That man?  JOHN CENA!

This guy is about as smart as his wife. 
I don't now why you wouldn't ride the hot hand until it's cold.
We also know who that it isn't the person that should be the starter for the rest of the season. 
Hey that guy in the post-game thread was right they are still gonna get called the worst undefeated team. 
It's kinda like banging the ugliest Victoria's Secret Angel
For those who aren't big on reading articles, they're not knocking the Panthers here, but just saying that they're the worst of the best.  They pay plenty of compliments to them as well, like comparing them to the '85 bears.

This is actually a pretty neat article if you're into statistics.
The previous worst team ever to start 11-0: the 1972 Miami Dolphins AKA The Last Team With A Perfect Season.

That's pretty good company.

[Yes, but we are 11-0.]( https://cinemafanatic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pirates_of_the_caribbean_the_curse_of_the_black_pearl.jpg)
This is partially due to the problems with Elo for rating football teams.

1. Silver carries over from last year (with some sort of partial regression to the mean). Since the Panthers were average last year, they started the year with a low Elo.
2. Elo gives you credit for beating a team based on their rating at that time, it doesn't adjust the skill of your prior opponents as you learn more about them. Thus, when the panthers beat the Texans and Bucs relatively early in the season, it gave them credit for beating two winless teams. Those teams are now 5-6 &amp; 6-5.

Article may be right that they are the worst 11-0 team, but I wouldn't take the Elo ratings as conclusive evidence.

After the Super Bowl victory: Why the 72 Dolphins would beat the 2015-16 Panthers
The 2013 Seahawks are the worst Seahawks team to win a Super Bowl.
LOL I didn't think it would be this literal.
Iowa and Carolina must get really tired of hearing this shit. Undefeated is still undefeated. 
"K", Panthers fans
[The only proper response.](http://i.imgur.com/3Riz2yY.gif)
Here's to being the worst 12-0 team in history.
And I think we are the best 4-7 team ever so we should beat them this Sunday
I'm just happy that people are writing about our team!
Psh duh, I'd much rather be 5-6 and be fighting for a chance at the playoffs than 11-0 and coasting in like some lazy sumbitches...

Seriously though, while they aren't blowing every team away, they are still undefeated and this late in the season, in 2015, I think that's mighty impressive.
Next up: the Panthers are the worst team in the NFL to win the superbowl
After 200 hours of film watching I can confirm that the Panthers are the *worst* undefeated team in the league 
According to the chart on this page the former 'worst to start 11-0' were those 72 dolphins losers.  Hope we don't end up like them.
Almost off-topic but I love 538. No better place to go for neutral debate discussion. They treat it like a sport and I highly recommend to follow along with them in the next repub/dem debate.
If you guys don't like being the worst 11-0 team, I'll trade you our [1rd place NFC Least pin for it.](https://i.imgur.com/VRK5UiG.png)
[Panthers like "k thx" ](https://media2.giphy.com/media/13UeVnBP6x05P2/giphy.gif)
The Lions were also the best team to ever finish 0-16.
I thought this was going to be a satire piece. 
I mean, there *has* to be a worst 11-0 team ever. They're all still really good, but one of them has to be sucking my penis.
Let's hope that we see a "the 2015-16 Carolina Panthers are the worst team to ever win a super bowl" at the end of the season.
You know what you call the guy who graduates at the bottom of his med school class?
Yeah, Panthers.  You need to play teams that aren't on your schedule obviously.
Like how Eli Manning is the worst 2x Superbowl MVP. 
oh no!!!!
On the upside they are the best 11-0 team currently playing in the NFL.
Even 538 dances around the turnovers. The Panthers are not only tops in the league at turning the ball over...they are also tops in the league in turnover differential. This stat is missing from this breakdown.
Fuck the stats, keep pounding :)
"one of the worst"

U wut m8
"Panthers fans whine too much about not getting respect"
ESPN is terrified of a world where the NFC east is mediocre (at best) football, the Packers are faltering, the Pats lost and seem mortal and all of their other large market / large fan base teams are under performing this year.

They hate the idea of covering a team like the Panthers all the way to the Super Bowl and will continue to post shit like this until the panthers win or are eliminated. 
I really hope the Panthers go undefeated from here on out. As the article says, they're a good team, but it does have a clickbaity title, and the detractors are going to use this against them.
I think the thing that stand out the most is the Panthers ability to adapt to the situation. Keeping plays alive, knowing when to go for it, when to play field position, ability to improvise, and that credit goes to the coach 
Still 11-0.  Not even mad.
[every fan in the stadium when the panthers win the super bowl at 19-0](http://i.imgur.com/vIf0lAD.gif)
Basically, they don't have a great passing offense and don't dominate as much as other undefeated teams. Thing is, high flying offenses usually lose to teams with good defenses and running games in the postseason. Carolina has a winning formula and is going places.
Yeah, well, the Browns are the worst team to go 2-9!
The "11-0 team" part is all I care about 
I swear if they run the table and win the super bowl, there will be articles about how they're the worst team ever to go 19-0.
Maybe I didn't read far enough, but I feel like it kept comparing them to high scoring offenses. When did the saying Defense wins Championships go out the window? 
According to the only stat that matters, they are the best team in the league. 
Still better than being the best team to ever start 0-11...
2007 patriots strength of schedule. 

http://imgur.com/wBQinxa
Schrodinger's Cat team, they are at once the worst and best team.
When the Panthers were 5-0 or so, I got into an argument with a Panthers fan and said that Carolina hadn't convinced me that they were truly among the league's elite, particularly because they hadn't played any legitimate teams, because didn't have a high average point differential in their wins, and because they were coming off of an embarrassing 7 win season.  They've since convinced me, regardless of what articles like this say.  They're the last undefeated team standing and they've done it with a bit of style.  Considering how hard my Birds suck, the Panthers have become one of my favorite teams to watch this season, and I hope that they keep it up.
Panther fans, Iowa Hawkeye fans feel your pain.  #NoRespect
For being the second worse 11-0 team in the Super Bowl Era, isn't the '72 Dolphins considered one of the best teams ever? 
...and they're laughing their way straight into the playoffs with home field advantage plus a bye.
Oh good, more stuff for RR to use to keep them level.
Wish we were that bad.
How can they be the worst team ever when their #1 WR is future HOF Super Bowl Champion Ted Ginn Jr.?
Even if it's statistically true, can we please stop with this "Panthers aren't worth their record narrative". You win games and you lose games. They win games, let's respect that. This is raining on parades and they haven't even finished their season yet.
[Panthers fans right now](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/42/a0/97/42a097e0dd03492425ce050f4598cdc0.jpg)
We did it, reddit!
I mean, they're no 2009 Saints
Here's what I took from this article: Yay! The Packers are still above average!
And if they win out, they'll be the worst team ever to go 19-0
I like this article because it kind of highlights how close all of the teams in the league actually are. As fans we forget that every team is made up of the best of the best, ran by the best of the best. It's easy to look at records or play and say this team is such and such better than that team, when in reality the difference in skill and ability is a lot closer than we think. That's why any given Sunday a team can win. 
To be fair the previous worst team to go 11-0 was the '72 Dolphins.
I think the 72 Dolphins were the worst.
I don't quite agree with the part about Cam Newton not being an enormous factor. They point to a strong rushing attack as the biggest strength and say the QBR takes Cam running the ball into account. But do they account for the read option and the respect be gets for that? I would imagine there is a spy on him pretty often, which occupies a defender. I get the feeling plugging in a better pure passer would result in a much worse Carolina team, but the metrics they use say he is middle of the pack. 
Eat a bag o dicks

Didnt see this but if im not mistaken this article says the Bucs could go 5/6 in the NFC south.
Panthers are the worst team in the league right now if you ask me.../s.
Honestly this is such bullshit panthers are 11-0 because they won every game they've had on their schedule so far if and they still get shit on. Good luck Carolina, anytime some one gets jealous look at your record you'll feel better.
While I think statistics like this are valuable, I think they speak with more strength in the NBA/MLB/NHL where much larger game number sample sizes can truly show the capabilities, and shortcomings of teams and have more fidelity.  Either way Carolina is undefeated.  
I feel like they've over come a lot to get to this point... To marginalize because they aren't playing top ten teams every week is just disrespectful.
This guy can get bent.
This probably going to make them play better, you know.
All record means is first round Bye and home field advantage. Playoffs tell the true tale.
A W is a W. The author sounds like a mad packers fan.  
Much like the 0-16 Detroit Lions were the best team to ever start 0-11. 
Soon to be 11-1 ;)
But they are 11-0!!

-Captain ~~Jack Sparrow~~Cam
I'll take it!
&gt; Add in the fact that Carolina wasn‚Äôt expected to be anything special before the season began

Can someone please explain this one to me?

First of all, it sounds like they're saying that one of the reasons the Panthers aren't as good as other 11-0 teams is because they didn't expect them to be good.  Doesn't that say a lot more about the quality of their expectations than the quality of the football team?

Secondly, shouldn't objective ratings drop the subjective elements by this point in the season?  I understand they give teams initial rankings so they can give their readers something to look at early in the season when there's not enough data.

But for their subjective opinion to still factor into things this late in the season makes the whole thing a bit phony, doesn't it?
"K" lol
Every time
Kind of a shit title, but I guess "The Panthers are the least impressive team, statistically, when compared to other teams that have started 11-0" doesn't roll off the tongue.  
I feel like since 538 was brought by ESPN that all they do is just pump out the narrative that ESPN wants to have some type of stats backup for...

Yeah they might not be the best 11-0 team ever, but you still have to be pretty dam decent to go 11-0.


Also when was the last time 538 got something right?
How sad of a life do you have to have to write something so negative about something so positive?
Panthers are 11-0. They're the best team in the NFL by record. I know a lot of people are saying "Oh but they had so many close games". No shit, this is the NFL, any given Sunday. Good teams find ways to win in those situations. I really don't care what anyone says about them, they've certainly got my respect as the top dog in the league right now until proven otherwise. 
Yes, this pleases me. 

ITT: Salty Panthers fans pissed about not being respected _enough_
The panthers......lol
Ah, but we are 11-0.

And if you're not down with that...
I'm all for analysis like this and agree the Panthers aren't as strong as their record, but you play to win the game, and so far they've done that.
Please keep doubting this squad.  They feed off it
The title makes this seem as though it is click bait material and in a sense it is. The fact does remain though that this list is populated with some of the best regular season teams the league has ever seen. As of right now it makes sense that the Panthers would be considered the worst team on a list made up of these great teams. However, the season isn't over and it does appear that the Panthers are on an upswing, especially now that the team is healthy again except for Tilman, who appears injured enough to miss significant time after the signing of Finnegan. I cannot speak about many of the teams on this list for I never had a chance to watch them play or follow football at all when they played, but I know that the Panthers start was weakened by key injuries to a slew of players early on thus they do have a chance to work their way up the ranks. 

Although the Panthers haven't been the most impressive team to go undefeated this far into the season I still feel like they have something special going on that could lead to an unimaginable ending for this team, it's fans and the Carolinas.  Due to the unfortunate injury to Benjamin and lack of depth behind him this team was yet again working with a receiving group populated by names that wouldn't get out of training camp on other rosters. They had to step up in the absence of a talent like Benjamin and they did so in a big way. They went from a group of guys that couldn't catch the ball placed directly on the numbers, to reliable, must cover players (Not double coverage, but coverage none the less, and Ginn is still good for a drop). They have improved a lot over the season and have turned into a solid receiving group, not close to the best in the league but a solid overall group.  

They also overcame significant injuries on defense early on yet management and the team had an answer for that as well. Some of it was the depth on the current roster and some of it was signing a player that other teams overlooked (Delaire) or older players that needed a new home to finish a career (Tilman, Allen) and the team has made it work. 

The idea of the Panthers being the clear cut #1 in the league is odd to me but after many years of following football, the NFL and this team I can say with certainty that I haven't seen a team like this in my lifetime. There is something special about this organization, from the former championship winning football playing owner who shamelessly plugs Bojangles to no end, to the spotlight shy GM who can crunch cumbers and find talent like no other to the ex-player turned head coach/river boat captain as well as a A+ social media team and lovable mascot.  No one name is bigger or more important than the others, no one player is the best at his position among the rest of the league (except for Kuechly) and if one player or multiple players go down they can still play great team football. I know this team is good and I feel they are headed for a big finish but I also know they can be beaten and in all honesty they aren't really the most talented team overall this year, but for right now they are the best team in the NFL and I will take that any day of the week.
They're certainly the least respected team to ever start 11-0.
Yall circlejerking over the title are ridiculous.  Its a good article, try reading it.
Can we start respecting the Panthers? Last thing we need right now is super motivated Cam going out to prove the Panthers are great. 
I don't know why people are getting upset at stuff like this.  I completely agree.  The Panthers are a fantastic team, but I don't even think they're the best team in the league.  They could go 16-0 and I might not think they're the best team.
Whatever lol.  11 wins is still 11 wins. 
Ah, there it is.
I used to think that to.... 
This gives me headache
You know what they call the guy who finishes last in his class at med school....
As a fan of the Iowa Hawkeyes and Andrew Wiggins, fuck what 538 says. You just do you Panthers
oh how horrible
They're winning games. As long as you get the W you can be as "bad" as you want 
The chiefs have to be one of the best to contrive to go 0-5 in a while.
Clicked the link expecting an Onion article.

[MRW](http://i.imgur.com/oxz7Iti.gif) reading this. 
Better than being the best team to start 0-11.
They've won a few too many close games, not only is that unsustainable but it also masks the problems of the team because winning makes everything good
Tl:dr: cam is meh but has been throwing the deep ball well
Who reads 538 anyway?


You can only beat whats in front of you, and these guys have beaten 11 out of 11 teams that they have played... 
They play defense (lower win-by average) and we didn't think they'd be good before the season. These are fantastic reasons to call them bad...
I absolutely despise stats like this.  Impossible to prove, great assumptions are made, the competition of other undefeated teams are impossible to compare.  And it all seems to go back to discounting Cam.  Just shut the fuck up until somebody beats them.  Jesus Fucking Christ.
Haters gonna hate. Stats for everything. Bottom line....only team left undefeated.

If you're 11-0 then you obviously aren't bad
Awesome.  Hopefully some Chiefs fans see this and realize the media isn't just targeting KC all the time, and that they say this shit about everyone.  Not to mention, this isn't even an insult.  Being the worst 11-0 team in a league with no other 11-0 teams still makes you the best team in the league.  Who gives a shit if they might not be better than the 11-0 Patriots in 2007?
I'm an Auburn fan as well as a Carolina fan, and this Panthers team reminds me so much of the 2010 Tigers. Even though you *know* they're not the most talented team in the field overall, you never really feel threatened to lose. It's like there's an underlying assumption of victory. I think it just goes to show grit and consistent play are just as important as raw talent.
Undefeated at this point in the season only means the team is great. It's incredible the lack of respect this team gets and the truth is nfl teams don't respect them as they should either. These guys play with a chip on their shoulders and are fun to watch because of that. They play playoffs football. Great defense , great running team and can pass enough to keep you honest on D. My guy Cam has been outstanding. Imagine if they had Benjamin. We are witnessing the growth of a running qb to a complete qb. 
When did 538 start covering sports?
They're still 11-0, regardless of anything else. 
Umm... I'd rather be the worst 11-0 team than the best 0-11 team.
538 has no hespect. 
pfft, who gives a shit, winning is winning
Good.  We play better when we're underrated. 
God dammit.  I've posted about how I'm sick of the "still the worst _____ team", and now 538 goes ahead and does this.
Soon: "The Panthers Are The Worst Team To Ever Go 19-0 and Win the Superbowl"
11-0 is still 11-0.
A lot of Jimmies will be rustled in this post..
I'd be cool with the Bucs taking this title from them next year. Undefeated&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the media's opinion 
[Ok, a simple "you suck" would have done just fine, but ah. . . ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPIq9cIupek)
I guess its a good thing we don't have to play the '85 Bears this year.

Who cares?  

All that matters is this season, there's no championship of historical champions outside Madden.
I think they are an incredible team who deserve a lot of respect, but I think this article touches a bit on why it's not the second coming of a Brady and Bellicheck undefeated season (for example)

Because it WOULD be a different story had they ONLY played above average or top tier teams, with their wins over the Packers and Broncos being the most significant, even those come with a dent due to the Packers lame-streak and an aged/injured Manning  who has been shown up and possibly down forever within the last three games.

They SHOULD make it to the Superbowl, as I see their defense scoring more points during the playoffs as a whole than their offense will; which is quite the statement towards their defense. And if they do I think all the media bias (if there even is any, I haven't seen any disrespect at all since around week 5) will disappear altogether
Didn't they start the season 6-1?
Haters gonna hate...
And I thought we'd be done with this. If I'm a panther player (or fan), I'd just be more motivated to want to win the SB, undefeated or not. To shut everyone the hell up.
I'd rather be the worst winner than the best loser. 19-0 sounds a lot sweeter than 18-1.
Pretty confident the Chiefs from a couple years ago are the worst team to start 11-0. They had a joke of a schedule and right when they played a team that mattered in the playoffs, they got owned. 
I dont think their the weakest just dont like that Cam Newton seems to be taking the spotlight when their defense is the real reason their 11-0.
Yeah but Cam has the best dance moves for a QB on the worst undefeated team in history.
the sound of 31 teams calling out sour grapes.  
This doesn't tell the whole story. The Panthers are not a flashy team that are going to put up a ton of points (though they do that anyway). They are a slow, methodical team who run more than they pass. They get a lead and refuse to let you get too many possessions to chip away at it. How many minutes have they trailed this season? Feels like it's been about 10:00 since the Seattle game.

Contrast that with the 2007 Patriots who wanted to score as many points as possible. Is that *better*? Maybe. I think it's just different. 
Duh and Cam is a mediocre QB at best but panther fans want to talk about how great he is while ignoring stats. 
I surely thought this was satire by the title, but actually reading the article it seems dead serious... Wow....
I've been really impressed by the Panthers this season. Out of curiosity I took a look at their schedule and all my respect for them was gone. They hands down have the easiest schedule I've seen in years.
I know this sounds dumb but Carolina just doesn't scare me, even after they came in to the Clink and beat us. I would feel pretty good about playing @Car as opposed to @Gb. They're a really good team but they just don't *feel* like a SB team - that's not an insult though, they certainly have the chance to prove me wrong.

Jeeze you panthers fans sure get upset over a little comment. 
Yeah, the Panthers are complete garbage
They're the worst best, or in other words, it's a weak year in the NFL. Who could have guessed?
I saw that they used espns total qbr about halfway through the article and I was pissed I had read that far. You play the schedule you're given and they're 11-0, that's the only thing that matters.
Still 11-0.
What's it going to take for the Panthers to get some respect?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Panthers remind me so much of the AZ Cardinals last year. They have like 5 wins which were basically coin flips if you look at win probability. And they've only had one road game against a tough opponent.
Oh boy now we can hear more bitching about how disrespected the Panthers are by everyone yada yada.
Does this surprise anyone? They aren't even the best team in the NFC, let alone the entire league
[deleted]
This is like being the worst looking supermodel. Sure you may not be the prettiest girl in town but there's a thousand people that wish they were you. 
you are what your record says you are
Oh come the fuck on. I would love the Texans to be the worst 11-0 team...
Respect to the Panthers is due, but can we first look at other teams that started 11-0? Because this could still be an unbiased and factual comment.
Hm something tells me Panthers fans don't mind...
Such a stupid article. Of course it puts more weight on the offense than the defense. So if your not running up the score, yeah your terrible. 
Imagine if they had Benjamin 

HRNNNNNNNGGGGG
We suck.
Doesnt matter  they are still undefeated
I don't feel comfortable betting on the Panthers to go very deep because they have a very strict formula for success.

Formula: Run the ball so well they are legitimately able to run (or threaten to) on 3rd down. Run so well they can limit Cam's throws to ~20/game. Run so well they can give Cam easier reads when he does throw, often big plays down the field off playaction. 

Problem game: They play a team that is able to limit their run game enough to make Cam throw ~35 times. And/Or they play a team that has 3+ receiving threats and can get to ~30pts by picking on 2nd, 3rd corners and those safeties. 

All this said, I still REALLY like this team. Their formula is a good one. I just worry about what happens when circumstances get them off of it.
Panthers get behind a few possessions and/or forced to throw more when opponent isn't biting play action as hard. Cam is very inconsistent throwing the ball (his compl % shows this). He misses high a lot, leading to tips and potential for turnovers. Him throwing more, especially when not off an effective run game is not a winning recipe for them. 

thats like saying someone is the least pleasurable sex god. 

just because someone is the least of the best doesnt make them anything close to bad
By undefeated standards yes they probably don't necessarily fit the bill but they are basically the same formula that the past 3 NFC Champions have been. Mobile quarterback with subpar WRs but a good ground game and a solid defense. Are they one of the best teams ever? No, but they have a chance to win some playoff games.
K
Except the bar is much higher now in 2015 than in 19xx. Everyone now is a freak athlete. More money breeds more monsters. 
/r/nflcirclejerk is leaking
Right below the second 'worst' '72 Dolphins... If I were writing this article I wouldn't feel good about my angle here.

This doesn't surprise me.  I just don't buy the Panthers as a good football team.  I think they get exposed by Seattle in the playoffs. 
I mean yeah they beat the Packers but the NFC south was gifted such an easy schedule this year

NFC east

AFC south

NFC south x2

a lot of teams could go undefeated with that schedule
That's what they get for taking out romo. Could've looked better keeping him in.
christ can you just fucking let em have this one

edit: nevermind they're awful? can i have my upvotes back?
Its going to be Panthers v. Vikings at the super bowl this year.
No one cares about this article..
&gt; ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good question, but I don‚Äôt really think it does because there are probably some guys on both teams who weren‚Äôt born when that streak began,‚Äù Rodgers said, via Carlos Monarrez of the Detroit Free Press. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a part of a lot of the games. There have been some close ones over the years, some battles. It‚Äôs just kind of fell our way the last 20 times or whatever but it‚Äôs always been very competitive.‚Äù
When Michigan was in the middle of losing 7 straight to the Buckeyes, I would get infuriated when anyone brought it up.  

But when it gets to 20 in a row, on the professional level?  That shit's just hilarious.  You almost have to be trying to fail that badly.

I love Aaron Rodgers and I don't care who knows 
People are going to get pissy about this, but this is hilarious and true. Kudos to Rodgers.
[deleted]
He mentions how the games were competitive, the reporters chuckle, he then tells them to chill and keep it professional.    
    
What do you expect? Him to say they didn't deserve any of the wins or something? I swear people just look for reasons to bash players sometimes. 
I think it's hilarious that the reporters laughed at his comment on the conference call.

&gt;There was then a pause for laughter from the questioners, but Rodgers was trying to be nice.

‚ÄúCome on now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúKeep it together. Keep it professional.‚Äù
I think this is hilarious. 

I also want the Lions to roll. 
Rogers is a master in the art of the suttle troll
Is it actually possible for someone to post the whole sentence of the quote? The blatant avoidance of context could not be more obnoxious.
Fuck this clickbait. That's not even what he meant
I love Aaron Rodgers sarcastic arrogant attitude, it's a breathe of fresh air from the stale political correctness we get from most players. 
Why do we allow shitposting of partial quotes to make them seem like the person is saying something they aren't?

I worry for the future of this subreddit if we don't ban shit like this.
Quick, somebody reverse that gif of him throwing the tablet.
That is a great answer. I can tell because I both love and hate Rodgers now
As a Lions fan I can honestly say that he isn't wrong. Detroit's ownership has ensured that the Lions have been and will always be a laughing stock...
inspirational quote of the day for Lion's fans...After losing 16 straight times to Jimmy Connors and then finally winning one, Vitas Gerulaitis proclaimed "Let that be a lesson to you all...No one beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row!"

Lions fans just have to substitute a number in the 20's, 30's or 40's
Rodgers is kind of an arrogant prick, and thats not just cause i like the Vikings

Edit: I read the whole comment, you can stop telling me that
**YOU JUST WAIT TILL MAMA KELLY HEARS ABOUT THIS ONE YOU BIG BULLY**
There's been at least two times the Lions had a solid shot at ending the streak:

* 2005: The Packers were a bad team plagued by injuries at key positions. They won 4 games that year, but it easily could've been 1 or 2. Week 15, the Lions came into Lambeau and long story short, the Lions were bad too, made some bad decisions during the game, and ended up losing in overtime.

* 2011 Week 17. The Flynnsanity game. The Packers have the top seed locked up, they're resting a bunch of starters, including Aaron Rodgers. The Lions score 41 points on the Packers weak defense, but somehow can't stop Matt Flynn from dropping 45 on them.
Aaron Rodgers on Lions: "Just kind of happens that we're way better than them."
Rodgers can come off as an ass sometimes, but I think he genuinely just loves what he does and has more fun with it than most
At this point, this is the only game I care about. Not that me caring is going to magically get this team's head out of its ass, but here's hoping!
Here are all games in the streak, sorted by final point differential of the games:
http://pfref.com/tiny/0ciOK

7 of the 23 were within 8 points.

13 of them were double-digit wins.
&gt;Every opponent of the Lions. 
&gt; [Let that be a lesson to you all. Nobody beats the Detroit Lions 21 times in a row.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c5/63/f4/c563f4510cbf67a070c09d89a6cd31b7.jpg)
The Lions dropped 21 straight against the Redskins when playing outside Detroit.  [It was a streak that lasted from 1935-2013.](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap2000000248844/article/detroit-lions-record-first-ever-win-at-washington-as-redskins-fall-to-03)
This reminds me of the Lion's kicer, Jason Hanson. Played for 21 years but never won at Lambeau. 
This is probably the best thing one could say when basically asked, "How do you explain never losing to the Lions?" There isn't a nice way to answer the question. 
Aarongant bastard!
Sounds about right coming from the butthole mayor of Titletown, USA.
Its also not crazy when you consider the fact the Packers have 2 HOF QBs and multiple... Holy shit, I just realized, Rodgers and Favre only have one ring each.. Thats crazy...

Don't you guys think? I mean, they're two of the best QBs ever.
I'll patiently wait for Kelly Stafford's response.
https://vine.co/v/elZOMPFAbnl
classic yellow journalism 
The braggiest humble brag ever.
cheeky fucker. aaron's a hoot.
Proceeds to lose at home while throwing SIXTY ONE TIMES and only scoring twice.  Love this guy. XD
What a cheeky cunt
I'm getting a little tired of Rogers trying to be so cute all the time.
What a pompous ass.
What's the point differential in those games?
Subtle banter.  Love it.
How Aaron got his groove back.
These humblebrag comments are getting out of control.
Ok, it's a cute home winning streak but the Packers have recently been blown out by the Lions at Ford Field.  None of us give a fuck what the Lions do right now anyway.  Is it really funny to beat a dead horse?
playing the majority of those games after thanksgiving is some bullshit too
Someday they'll schedule a game in Lambaeu in September in a year the Lions aren't godawful.
Stupid sexy Rodgers.
I'd love to mention how Aaron Rodgers' has behaved really professionally lately...but then, there was the whole iPad thing.. 

case always finding a way to get that starting job. Good luck buddy
I said yesterday that the Rams offense just needs a spark and they're golden.

Case Keenum was not what I was thinking of as the definition of a spark.
Foles went from backup, to Pro bowl QB and then back to backup in three seasons.
remember when he had 27 TDs and 2 INTs in 2013? 
This seems like a bad idea. But hey were starting Blaine Gabbert so what do I know.
BEST TEXANS QB OF ALL TIME! I AM OFFICIALLY A RAMS FAN! I AM SO EXCITED RIGHT NOW! 
I really like Case.

EDIT: ALL HAIL THE CASED GOD
**Ian Rapoport ‚Äè@RapSheet**

&gt; Nick Foles is not injured. This is simply Jeff Fisher making a QB change to Case Keenum.
Wow! That is crazy. He wasn't great last year, but he was definitely not gonna get benched for Sanchez. 
https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/666351046562816000

Guess it's 13 now
So by Week #11, Sam Bradford and Nick Foles who were traded for each other will not be starting for either one of their teams.
Til keenum is on the Rams 
If Case can hit 60% of his passes and convert more than 24% of 3rd downs it'll end an upgrade. Not hard to do. 
Sometimes I think Jeff Fisher came to St Louis to give us years of under .500 football in revenge for that super bowl loss.
He has been absolutely awful.
Keenum time!  Although he is a pretty terrible QB (when he was a Texan) he made that 2013 season a little easier to swallow.  He's definitely a guy you can root for, and every once in awhile he'll make an unbelievable just beautiful throw...after an interception of course. 

I've been paying attention to the Rams this year with Donald and Gurley playing well, and this is even more of a reason to watch.  Rams just got a little more fun. 
I don't know if Keenum will be a successful starter, but after I watched his play in Houston I thought he deserved at least a fair shot with some QB-needy team. Hopefully he'll get a fair go with the Rams.
[Case Keenum](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap2000000276132/The-Keenum-Johnson-connection) is gonna light it up.
Can someone explain to me why people act like it's a lose-lose trade?

Bradford got injured, sure, but he'll be back in two weeks, and his play had been improving greatly over the past few weeks.

Whereas Foles is just inconsistent and benched for poor play.
Lol Keenum-Mania is back! 
Wow.  [They must be truly desperate.] (http://i.imgur.com/Bj9aOTJ.jpg)
This won't solve anything. There are deeply rooted problems in this team that can only be fixed by a coaching change at this point.

Fisher has been given more than enough time to cure this team of it's stupid penalty woes and poor offensive performance. I can't thank him enough for getting us out of the slump we were in when he came here but it's time to move on and get someone who wants to take this team somewhere rather than be content playing smash-mouth defense and ignoring the offense.

Keep Snead, move on from the coaches. We cannot waste the prime years of Gurley, Austin, Donald, and Quinn with this awful playcalling and game planning.
At this point, Bradford for Foles looks like a wash.
This Foles for Bradford trade is starting to look like a suicide pact.  
Has Foles been that bad?
Is this really what the NFC West has come down to? Starting QB's discarded by the lesser AFC South teams? 

What's next? The Seahawk's bench Wilson for Ryan Mallet? And at what point should I expect Jake Locker to be leading the Cards?
I have absolutely no doubt this is Fisher's attempt to use Foles as his scapegoat this year. 
Amazes me how Jeff Fisher is still an NFL head coach. This is his 21st season as an HC in the pros, and he has had s grand total of 6 winning seasons in 20 years, probably 21 at the end of this season. Totally overrated, when he does get fired from the Rams (possibly at the end of this season) surely no one else will hire him at HC level ? 
THANK YOU LORD JESUS. 
So who's winning the Eagles-Rams trade so far honestly? 
Welp. Guess I'll get ready for Foles-to-Texans rumors. Of course Keenum displaced him too.
KEENUMITES, THE TIME IS NOW!!
Give Sean Mannion a chance
I did not see this coming
[Called it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3t2ans/the_broncos_will_become_the_11th_nfl_team_to_use/cx2gx67) Even though we should have given no experience Mannion a shot.
Yup. I lived in Philly for several years before recently, so I'm familiar with his game.  I, honestly, saw this coming.  He throws back-foot floaters that would put a Kobe fadeaway to shame.  
And, yet, if you listen to Philly radio... they still want Foles and are calling for Bradford to be put to pasture. I hate my fan base sometimes. 
So... did anyone win that trade?
Well if Bradford won't start NEITHER WILL FOLES -- Jeff Fisher, probably
Am I the only one thinking that they should've kept Austin Davis right about now?

I said it when he was cut before the season.
This won't save your job Fisher
Is a sorry or a you're welcome in order?
[Awesome I can finally wear this again!](http://i.imgur.com/Ab6j6Zt.jpg)
So, who makes out in this trade?  The Rams or the Eagles?  Seems like if they stuck with the QBs they had, they would still be in the same position now. 
r/CaseKeenum must be ablaze!
Here I come
Is it bad that I still like Nick Foles and think that he can do alright in this league?
We're not playing St. Louis this year are we? Cause if Case can beat anyone, it'll be us.
That is crazy talk!  Nick Foles was so good in Philly, how has he gone so far astray, and why aren't any of these fuckers going for Tebow time?!  It would sell tickets, and all the dude does is win.  Ignore his religious shenanigans and let the boy eat!
Baby come back.
You know how Bill Bellichick's Superbowl defensive gameplan is in the hall of fame?

They need to do the same thing for Chip Kelly's playbook from 2013. Him being able to make Foles look that good when he was barely a backup caliber QB is hall of fame worthy.
I mean, Keenum ain't any better, eh? Should've kept Austin Davis, eh? 
Well then.
Yeah, anything ive seen from foles this year has shown me that he just isnt that good

Career journeyman backup if need be but not a starter right now
Damn. I didn't know Foles had been that bad.
Starting was the Case that they gave me
That's a little harsh. I didn't expect Bradford and Foles to get injured/benched in the same week.
I don't think Keenum will be any better.  I'm guessing this blows up in Fisher's face.  But I guess we'lll see.
Lol.
Getting traded and then benched will completely fuck up Foles confidence. Not saying it was the wrong move but I feel like St.Louis should be prepared to restart at QB again.
I was under the impression that Foles was playing okay. Huh, guess I was wrong.
Why are they playing the guy who does the voice of Shaggy?

Ooops. Read his name wrong.
OH YEA BABY
Hah... Foles tore our ass up too :'(
As a university of Houston graduate, this makes me excited
I don't know why the Texans got rid of Keenum so readily.  I think the dude can play.
I know it's just me, but it seems like Connor Cook has been destined to be the Rams QB for like 3 years. Like Johnny Manziel on the Browns, Cook to St. Louis just seems *right.*
YES! NOW I CAN BRING OUT MY TEXANS KEENUM JERSEY AGAIN!
This looks like a desperation move by Fisher to save his job. If he's not 8-8 at the end of the year, I bet he's gone. 
The Rams' next game is against the Ravens. 

Case Keenum's first career win was against the Ravens team last year that went 10-6. 

The Ravens are 2-7 this year.

Cased God is wrapping up another W on Sunday.
Bout damn time. Why did we extend his contract without having him play?Jared Goff hype train?
Foles was bad, but it wasn't like his WRs or play calling were doing him any favors. They were dropping balls all day and for some reason they barely ran the ball. 
Dominate through Redskins picks.
4-12 here we come. It looked so promising. I'm going to go drink myself happy again. 
Can Case Keenum just like go undefeated the rest of the way through the season and into the playoffs so I can forget this season and just witness the meltdown of the media, reddit, and the entire league?
Jesus Christ. Between benchings and injuries:

EJ Manuel
Geno Smith
Johnny Manziel
Michael Vick
Landry Jones
Brock Oswelier
Matt McGloin
Zack Mettenberger
Ryan Mallett
TJ Yates
Matt Hasselbeck
Blaine Gabbert 
Brandon Weeden
Matt Cassel
Mark Sanchez
Dan Orlovsky
Shaun Hill
Luke McCown

And now Case Keenum

Did I miss anyone?
TO BACKUP TEXAN QBS!

YATES AND CASE TO THE SUPERBOWL!
Case was pretty good for us...until teams started blitzing. He had no idea what to do at that point. So hopefully he's learned a few things since then.
CHIP KELLY IS A MASTERMIND
Man. He gets to do music countdowns on the weekend AND play QB!
CASE KEENUM HYPE AGAIN WOOHOO
UH coogs!
Go COOGS!
I got [downvoted to hell] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3ru2sg/brees_threw_as_many_or_more_td_passes_last_week/cwrhg4e) when I told Rams fans that it was only a matter of time before everyone realized that Foles was not an NFL starting QB.   Dude is just not good.

Granted, Bradford hasn't been much better - but I was never a fan of Foles.
Remember when a great run game, OL, screen passes, and QB rating made people think Foles was a good QB? That's was funny.
Welp... I'll eat my words. Turns out we did get out of there ahead.

Bravo Chip, Bravo.
This was one of those rare trades where it is a lose-lose on both sides. 
10-0 and Case Keenum starting... UH fans will be particularly insufferable this week.
Woohoo....
How fucking pathetic. Fisher in full "cover your ass" mode. 
Nobody won the trade!
Texans solution?
Foles benched. Todd Gurley to start at running back, quarterback and Jeff Fisher.
http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2246443/ItCrowdDenholmWindow.gif
Is alex smith next?
Things I never thought I would see as a headline this year for 200, Alex.
Good to see Matt Saracen getting another chance to start. 
If Fisher dosen't win this Ravens game he needs to be fired. He's in total panic mode right now.
The only starting quarterbacks this season with a lower passer rating than Keenum are Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck. Weird to think about. 

Edit: Foles, not Keenum. 
This is the strangest Monday.
Based Keenum please  don't  suck
Well, at least Arizona still has Gronk as their claim to fame.
What the fuck?
hmmm...I guess it could be worse for us Philly fans


Rams should call Green Bay and make an offer for Brett Hundley in the offseason. 
GO COOGS!
How about a fresh RG3 ;) ;) ;) ;) ;) ;)
Thank God.
"Foles was the answer, he has always played better than Bradford"
This weekend was something else for football, madness everywhere
Case Keenum:  a Houston hero among the locals.  He's a competitor but the competition knows to get him off his spot and he will fail miserably if on the run.  For whatever it's worth, we all like him, here.
CASE KEENUM!!! yes now i'm a rams fan 
We are going to here "Keenum to Welker" so much in the coming weeks.
Case Keenum: Because Fuck Your Season.
was he playing bad? I haven't been watching him
Best news ever, GOAT Texans qb imo
PUT MANNION IN!!
I guess he must hand the ball off better. 
He has been improving, regardless of whatever spin you want to put on it. 
Bradford goes down, Foles follows suit.

Only right.
from 7 TDs in a game, most TDs without a pick.....to benched.

How the mighty have fallen
how can they bench Nick Foles, NFL record holder for most touchdown passes in a single game?
Really? I didn't see the game, and knew he did pretty bad from the stats, but that bad? He's looked very good in some games.
Cheering for you Keenum, bro. 
Keenum and Yates.  What year is it??
KEENUM HYPE

Keenum isn't the answer. Fisher really needs to just leave his QB's alone. They aren't always the problem, just easy to blame. Finally gets one that doesn't get injured and puts his team back in the same position......treading water with a backup QB
Next week is the second Ravens game I'm going to in person, the first one was the Browns first year back in the league.

I hope I'm making it count.
is that a real person?
How do you spell 'desperate'?

K - e - e - n- u -m
Fisher is gonna be fired this offseason. Calling it.
No idea why but I love Case Keenum
I have been a huge fan of his since I watched him torch defenses in college. I thought with a few years behind a veteran he could develop into an above average starter. No one has given him that chance but once again Case gets his shot as a starter. Long live Keenum!
Year of the backup QB is in full swing
This is going to be fun. 
It could work  
If Gary Kubiak didn't have his little heart attack during that Colts game, Keenum would be considered a top fi-... Top 30 QB.
Some will say that he made his...... CASE...... for the starting job












I'll see myself out
Just get Geno Smith so he can be reunited with Austin and Bailey already.

Let's Go!
Bears, you broke a quarterback! And it wasn't yours!
ITT: eagles fans saying they got the better end of the trade..rams fans saying they did.
Can teams realize that they shouldn't trade for Eagles QBs?  They're a product of the system and that's it.
But.. but Nick Foles was the upgrade this team needed to make the jump..

.500 Fisher's gotta make sure he stays at .500 somehow, I guess
Foles benched. Bradford hurt. Well that trade went well.
Case Keenum just keeps getting chances. Whenever the Keenums and the Colt McCoys and Chase Daniels continue to play, I hurt a bit inside for Colt Brennan
It's sad Foles isn't working out for them, but at least they had a Case up their sleeves.
I really don't feel like Foles was the problem here.... Any Rams fans care to shed some light?
So, like, the Foles-Bradford trade was like trading poop back and forth huh?
So Philly wins the trade?
Who the fuck is Case Keenum?
Nobody really won this trade then. True, the Rams got a 2nd round pick out of it, but neither team has found their franchise QB.
One time I started keenum over cam newton in fantasy.  Cam made me regret that decision....
Lose/lose trade 
[Looking at the rest of our schedule.](http://i.imgur.com/QzodQGj.gif)
Foles for Bradford is the most underwhelming trade ever
Who would have thought that an exchange of mediocre, disappointing quarterbacks wouldn't work out for either team?
Both the Rams and the Eagles lost that trade apparently.
Man I wish the Rams would have kept Austin Davis. I would love to see what he can do with a decent running back behind him. Granted, I'm biased since I went to Southern Miss. 
If it makes the Rams feel any better... I'm more afraid of Case Keenum than Nick Foles... because I've seen Case Keenum throw shit deep just because he can lol.
One time I started keenum over cam newton in fantasy.  Cam made me regret that decision....
I've always been a big Foles hater, but since he's not on the Eagles anymore, I don't care.
SNOW DAY!
Peyton Manning can't play in the....

Oh, yeah. 
I just moved to Denver from Florda

not used to this at all
What was that absolutely ridiculous game from a year or two ago? Detroit Philly? I'd love to see a repeat.
While it is fun to get excited, just remember last two times 6+ inches of snow was forecasted for a game, the game was delayed a few days (one to MNF last year and other to Tuesday Night in 2010) the Eagles/Lions game had a forecast of 1-2 inches but ended up at way way more. Luckily here, this is UP TO 6 inches. Let's hope nothing gets move and we get a good snow game.
If you go on Weather.com, it says it should only Snow 1-3 inches. Either way, the weather lies all the time. There was suppose to be possible Snow in the Seahawks-Broncos Superbowl and it was a pretty good (winter) day. 
I love snowy football games, so I may see 6 inches of growth during this game too.
http://i.imgur.com/mcV03LQ.jpg
At least the Patriots know how to fuck over AFC West teams in the snow. 
Oh baby, love me some snow games
A cold lobster is easier to crack ... just saying. No pun intended
This is what I will look forward to the rest of the season. Snow games
According to an Informer, there will be 12 inches of snow.
As far as I can tell, Tom Brady's Patriots are 12-0 with snow on the ground, winning by an average of 23 points (29 - 6.58). Hard to find precise stats of snow vs cold wet rain...if anyone can provide a correction, that'd be great
Time for The Blizzard of Oz! 
6 inches of snow is nothing... and the field is heated.
Pats paid mother nature SNOWGATE 2015
Put in manning pls
Pats undefeated in the snow.
I hope it does snow, for the sole reason of getting more michaels and collinsworth gold.
I'm so excited for this game. SNOW BOWL!!!
The weather could make things completely irrelevant. You have to play in a completely different manner than during a normal day. That worries me mightily, however our offense with Brock is supposed to be an all weather offense. 
FUCK YEAH SNOW FOOTBALL!
Anyone who knows Denver weather knows that it is more likely we will get a dusting of snow. 
Advantage Brady.
I can't wait for Don Shula to comment on what the Patriots are like in snow.
i guess we are going to run the ball
[Death, taxes, and Brady winning in the snow!](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ly29fpwnpw1qg6v55o1_500.jpg)
Yes! Brady loves him some snow games!
Manning isn't playing and the Broncos are more built for the cold/snow/playoff games with Kubiak and with a laser armed QB like Brock. 
No wonder denver are keeping manning out.

A full dick of snow. 
You think we're struggling with a running game now? It will be non existent in a snow bowl.
Ah hell yeah!

I'll never forget that snow game in Philly a couple years ago. Seemed like there was nearly a foot of snow on the field. 
Who's Snow? 
Lambeau west?
Snow day! 
and here I am... can't even get a drop of rain.
FUCK YEAH! 
King Brady thrives in the snow.
Denver weather report?  24 hours out? hahhahaa... ok whatever.
now i am 100% positive the patriots will win
I know Brady is a great QB, but the question is can he show it on a cold snowy night in Denver?
FOOTBALL WEATHER!!!!
Has anyone been to Denver? Not only do they not get a lot of snow due to the rain shadow, but the weather changes so quickly there. Our "blizzard" last week was gone by noon because the sun came out and the temp went up to 65. It wouldn't surprise me, but I wouldn't get too excited either.
Yep, I'm watching this game!
FUCK YEAH!
Im hoping this neutralizes the pass rush somewhat.

Last week was scary as hell.
Weather the greatest equalizer. This could swing it even more in Denver's favor. The ball tends to bounce in weird ways when it comes to bad weather games.  
This game should be fun. 


Denver AKA Ygritte
LET IT STORM!
If it snows a bunch, I will find a way to watch that game.  
Gotta flex it.
Weather report still checks out for snow starting around the time the game begins. Can't say how heavy it will be. Won't have an accurate weather report until tomorrow morning though.
I love snow games. So much fun to watch.
What does this mean for Gostkowski? 
El Nino is coming for the Pat's perfect pace.
Won't happen. 
Used to work at Red Lobster and can confirm that the lobsters come in and can't move when they are delivered off the refrigerator truck. Brock Lobster (a.k.a. Brock Strap) shut down incoming! 
Incoming on ESPN.com:

"Does Bill Belichick have a secret weather controlling machine? #Snowgate"
Advantage: Brady
[Patriots have done fairly well in the snow](http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/09000d5d81382f02/Patriots-59-Titans-0)
This isn't going to happen.  Expect a dusting, at best.
Super Sunday Snowday Shootout 
Kind of hilarious how people are super focused on the QBs and not the fact that snow has the biggest impact on pass rushers. I'll take Brady with time vs a Kubiak/Phillips defense over Brock with time vs. a Belichick/Patricia defense. 
I hope it snows like crazy, I love watching bad weather games.

Usually it seems that snow favors offense over defense, both on the line and in the secondary.  I believe a lot of snow will allow receivers to get more open and give both QBs more time to throw the ball.  I think this favors the Patriots overall.

It doesn't get much more challenging than this for Brock, we'll get to see him in prime time, against a top defense and coach, and he'll need to keep pace with Brady's scoring.
What are the thoughts on playing Sanders or Lafell? Not sure who I can rely on more here
Hope Brady brings a gator... Von's gonna bury him in the snow a few times.
6" of snow is what all of your moms call me!

I have a small penis. Sob.
I hope Tom Brady gets a snowball to the face or three 
Come on Broncos, you gotta help us out here!
Great news. :)
i wish Peyton was full strength for this game...just not the same 
Oh God, I'm going to have such a chub watching a snow game. Snow games are the reason I wake up in the morning.
I mean it's colorado in frigging November, snow's not that uncommon. I lived north of Denver up off the I-40 corridor and we usually had standing snow for the year by now.

I've got a coworker up there for the game (she's an avid Broncos fan). Hope they don't get stuck--they're native Texans and she can't drive for shit in the snow
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow. 
Think of those idiots that paid 700+ for the tickets thinking they were going to watching perhaps the last Manning/Brady matchup. LOL...now they have to sit in the freezing snow watching Brock and Brady.
And they'll keep playing, which is awesome. This is why I've always said football is a way manlier sport than baseball. Those fairies not only stop playing if it rains, they *cover the field* like a bunch of pussies.  "Athletes" worried about getting their clothes wet.
If they actually get 6 to 8 inches of snow that day I'll send you a pic of my fully engorged dick.  It never happens. 
Denver isn't the only one who might see up to 6 inches tomorrow...
Denver could see up to 6 inches of my dick during Sunday's Patriots @ Broncos game.
On one hand, I'd love to watch a snowy game because they're awesome, but on the other hand I don't want to have to watch a Patriots game. Can't it just snow somewhere else?
[deleted]
...And ten inches of Gronk
He got leveled so many times I'm not entirely surprised. 
Looks like the Colts are going undefeated for 2-6 weeks
I'm really, really hoping for a 6-10 division winner this year.
NFL 2015: Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Kidneys, Knees and Kidneys.
How the heck did he keep playing through that??
Well fuck.
So that means for the past two days, he has been pissing or shitting blood. Like black blood. Gross/awesome.

Edit: As \m/etal as this is, it is wrong. From /u/Smeeee:
&gt; Your thought about black blood is correct, if bleeding happens in the upper bowels (like the stomach or small intestine). Digested blood becomes black.

&gt;However, bleeding from other organs (kidney, liver, spleen) is often contained within that organ. If it does "spill out," it does so into the area around that organ, either the peritoneum or retroperitoneum, which are both just spaces. If the bleeding stops, it just sits there, but doesn't go into the bowels.
He played his heart out against the Broncos. Ugh....really hope he heals quick. Unfortunately reports are saying 2-6 weeks 
Is all the abuse that he has taken his first 3 years finally catching up to him? His body has really been breaking down this year.
And of course the Falcons play the Colts after our byes. I think the Falcons have played against 5 backup QBs this year now.
Normally I'd say we have a good chance of winning our game now, but we just lost to Blaine Gabbert.....
Ouch.  Best of luck recovering.  Kidney lacerations are not good.
The Chargers and Colts should get together and try to field a team of actual starters for the rest of the season. I'm not sure they can.
Andrew Luck might actually die on the football field if the Colts don't do something.
I gotta give major props to the guy. He was getting hit hard and still held his own in the pocket. Guy is a beast for playing through that and winning
Multiple rib fractures

Throwing shoulder separation

Ankle soreness

And now ripped kidney.

He is fucking broken
This season can go fuck itself.
Fuck.  Bad news.  Get better Andrew.
I'm guessing it was the hit when he got folded over with the double hit. 
This just makes me more scared for Brady when we play the Broncos
&gt; Timetable is 2-6 weeks

Looks like the AFC South might have a new division winner this year
The last game I attended before Sunday's game vs the Broncos, I bought tickets to the Colts Vs Steelers in the summer during Peyton's operational recoveries.  He never came back to play for us again....

Then i go a few years without attending a game and go to the Colts Broncos game 2 days ago...

I need to stop killing our Quarterbacks....  
Damn luck was just starting to show up too. Brutal news but if Hassel can keep them in contention for a few weeks they might be able to make a run.

Bye week came at a perfect time.
[Oh] (http://images.performgroup.com/di/library/sporting_news/12/66/this-is-fine-dog-embed_c1wcflsukty01jr4jtcy11rrx.jpg)
I saw two things about this on the right hand side of espn.com

1) Ryan Clark saying Luck's "future is in doubt" and the Colts might hesitate to sign him long term for big money.  This is the stupidest thing I've read all day and I'm on Reddit.

2) A quote crediting the Colts' medical staff for catching this.  The dude was likely pissing and maybe even shitting blood.  Ok yeah I couldn't diagnose it but let's not pretend they found some obscure condition.

And I've spent years watching Kobe Bryant shoot 7-39 and having Sportscenter highlights show all his makes and his point total.

tldr; I fucking hate espn
Argh! Our kryptonite! Shitty backup QBs!
This was fun. YOU WIN.

http://i.imgur.com/0X9V4xA.png
I'm a little late here, but why do so many people (on this sub at least) hate Luck so much? Are all the new shitposts about him just because the news just broke or what?
There's a significant chance that a Titans vs. Jaguars Thursday night game in November will have a significant impact on the playoffs. What year is this? 2007?
Did Aqib Talib poke him in the tummy?
4-12 Colts playoff appearance confirmed?
God damn... That sounds horrible. 
2015:  The year of QB killers.
The hit. 

https://twitter.com/CameronWolfe/status/664178288139460608
The AFC South winner is going to have six wins. 

We have a tough schedule and at best can probably win four‚Äîat worst we'll probably win two. 

Let's see what Hasselbeck's got. 
He went out and threw the game-winning TD anyway. That's some Brett Favre shit.
Thank God for the bye week.
It's really a shame we have only gotten to see the real Andrew Luck play once this season. Finally looked like himself Sunday. 
Jesus Christ a lacerated kidney. On the brightside the division is a fucking mess and the team is in cabable hands under Hasselbeck. 

Plus you beat the Broncos. Get well soon you beautiful caveman
I didn't get to watch the game as I was driving but listened ESPN indy for it.  Radio guys didn't ever mention a time where he got hurt and was down or anything like that
The 2016 Colts will become the first team to draft 7 straight offensive linemen.

Aw hell, they may draft some gaybos too.
Damn that is brutal, I was so impressed with his performance on Sunday. Hope he heals up quickly.
Shoutout to the Mods for deleting all the redundant bullshit
Dammit, we really should have drafted at least two or three more wide recievers.
This is what happens to you if you don't invest in a solid NFL offensive line around your big time QB. Colts management has only themselves to blame for this fuck up by thinking they could just get aging former star players and treat a team like a rotisserie team. 
YOU'VE GOTTA BE KIDNEYING ME!!
You know from all the injuries that Luck has incurred this year, I don't think anyone can talk about him not playing through the pain.  He's one tough QB. 
Does anyone think this has anything to do with the supposed rib injuries that weren't reported by the team the past couple of weeks? I wonder if a lacerated kidney is a product of a broken rib? Not making accusations, just wouldn't be surprised if the team loaded him up with pain killers and sent him out there for the Broncos game.
Well that's... unfortunate.
Damn, didn't seem like he was in pain during the game.  Huge injury season for a lot of star players.  He and Roethlisberger now have been out twice from injuries.

Hopefully Colts let him rest the FULL time he needs.  I'd rather have a healed player than a better record.  
Oh no, poor Luck! He played great on Sunday. Hope he gets rest and a lot of reading in. 
I got abdominal injuries just from watching him get hit on nearly every play.
Jesus how do you even get lacerations on your kidney?!
Now I feel stupid for saying "Man, I love how he'll stand in the pocket and throw deep even though he's about to get smashed". 
Injuries suck. :/ I'm pretty convinced that a player's likelihood of staying healthy in the NFL comes down to dumb luck. It doesn't matter is you're a pocket passer, a running QB, smash-mouth running back or a even kicker. A guy can take 100 hits a season and walk away smiling but another guy will make one bad turn and see his season go down the drain. It's just cruel. Anyways, I hope Luck gets well soon.
I first read it as abnormal injuries.

I really like cheesecake.
So Luck is held together by duct tape and chewing gum at the moment?  And a truck load of cortisone shots? 
I wouldn't be shocked if something like this has been going on all season. He's been getting buried every game and hasn't looked like himself. Best of Luck and hope he heals up quickly.
Texans this is your chance!
Do they really expect us to believe he wasn't hurt before this game? Colts trying to cover their ass saying he got hurt on Sunday.
This dude is tough as nails, I'll give him that. 
I genuinely like Andrew Luck and wish good things for him. His team's useless management are to blame for his season. 
Gg no re :(
FUUUUUUUCKKKKK MEEEEEEEEE
Tough bastard, still went out and finished the game. Hopefully it's quick recovery
I said it multiple times during that game that he would get hurt scrambling as much as he was 
This is the Jaguars time to shine.
Alright Jacksonville, time to capitalize!
Please keep Hasselbeck away from chicken burritos until Luck can come back.
If the Colts win the division every coach in this division should get fired 
Probably the reason he was cussing on the radio after the game!
I stand by my prediction that the Jaguars will host a playoff game this year.
It's kind of amazing how tough he is. I don't recall seeing a play he got injured on, and with the likely broken ribs earlier in the season. It might be to the detriment of the team when he's only playing about 60% but can't doubt his toughness
HASSELBECK BABY WE'RE HEADIN TO THE SUPERBOWLLLL L
TBH I still think we can win the division... 
I need a Colts version of [this](https://i.imgur.com/J7QTc1S.jpg) ASAP for situations like this.
I'm obviously not an Indianapolis fan but fuck. Wow. 
The price of beating that nasty defense. 
Ok, Red Alert everyone! Keep Hasselbeck away from ALL chicken burritos! He's too important now!
The durability of some athletes is insane. I remember a few years ago during the NHL playoffs Patrice Bergeron played through broken ribs and a punctured lung. It's crazy that the body can take so much damage and keep going.
It's go time for Hasselsaurus Beck
I'm honestly not all *that* concerned.  Bye week is next, the division is awful, we have all 3 division teams left (and if he's back in 4 weeks he'll play all 3), plus the Bucs, Dolphins, and Falcons, who are not particularly good right now.  Steelers are tough, but it's not that hard a schedule.  Compare that to the Texans, who have to play all 3 division teams plus the Jets, Pats, Bills, Bengals, and Saints, or the Titans, who have to play 4 division teams plus the Jets, Pats, Panthers, and Ravens.  Those are pretty brutal non-division schedules.
http://imgur.com/SF8MzIP
This is absurd. Teams have received the scouting report and are releasing their backup QBs on the Falcons.

What's the list up to now? Weeden, Mallet, Mettenberger, Gabbert, Hasselgoat? Are we going to face the wrath of Derek 'GOAT' Anderson with playoff implications?
Fire Grigson. Andrew needs a fucking offensive line.
Textbook Phyrric victory
In an interview Luck responded to this statement with "Worth".
Matt Hasselbeck is a great backup, so I wouldn't be surprised if we win the next 3
Thats not so bad, Tom Brady has played with a torn hymen for years
We want the ball and we're gonna score!
Okay AFC South bros, we have to talk. Pull up a carpet square and grab a juice box.

Look, someone has to win this division. I know we're all doing our best to keep that from happening, but it has to happen. Volunteers? Anyone? Is there anyone at all that wants to win this division?
Titans back in business
Their schedule is so cake that they have a very good shot at only dropping 1 or 2 games in 2-6 week time period.

Next 6 weeks: 

BYE

@ Atlanta

Tampa Bay

@ Pittsburgh 

@ Jacksonville

Houston
Dear god. I hope he's ok.
AFC South is wide open now. Hope Luck has a smooth recovery and the Colts don't try to bring him back to soon.
The Texans are going to end up winning this division at 5-11 or something aren't they 
So this lacerated kidney helps prove that broken ribs rumour might be true right? I'm no doctor but I imagine a broken rib can do that to a kidney. I dunno tho I'm dumb
Ryan "he should be used to it by now" Grigson: http://i.imgur.com/IBYziY3.jpg
Oh thank God /r/nfl/new is clean. 
He's kind of injury prone for a guy his size.
Whoops...
Two years ago at home we lost Reggie to the Broncos.
This year at home we lose Luck to the Broncos.

Let's just stop playing The Broncos at home.  From now on all Colts/Broncos games must be played in Denver.  I'll bring the weed.

Who's with me??
Enough with the Andrew Luck injury, what is the NFL gonna do about Greg Hardy?
This is such a brutal game. Get well soon Andrew.
He got pounded all game long
Was actually really looking forward to getting to see Luck play in person. I hate when injuries happen.
Holy shit, best of luck to Luck on recovering
:(

I hope he will be fine, I've never heard of a player getting this injury

Hasselbeck will lead us to the promise land while he is gone 
And a lacerated kidney? WTF...how does one lacerate a kidney. Poor guy has been getting lit up...that's sad. :-/
Jesus Christ.

Did he leave the game? Or play through it?
Colts will be fine.
Sigh. :'(
Call me the eternal optimist, but...

Assuming a 2 week time table, and with the bye this week, that could mean he doesn't actually miss a game. 
We'll be alright.
Shit. Looks like it's HasselGOAT time.
Grigson trying to build a team designed to get Luck killed. Way to protect the future of your franchise. No way he keeps his job now. 
Just when he was starting to hit stride. This sucks. 
Hoyer the destroyer will lead the Texans to the playoffs!
This must be the chosen thread.

Seriously though holy shit that sucks.
Let's go Hass!
2-6 weeks is a large variance
The Year of the Kidney Lacerations is upon us.  
I HATE EVERYTHING.
Poor guy has taken an absolute beating this year.
[...](http://s4d3.turboimg.net/t1/12815236_1343677116644.gif)
And they still win the division. Kill me
Last game Hasselbeck played he was sick. Like shitting through a screen door without hitting any metal sick. Maybe our chances are better than we think. Especially with a bye and a new OC. 
What the fuck is going on with Luck this year? This is like his 4th different injury.
Feels like every good thing I can take from a week is slapped down by something else. Fuck sake.
This really sucks for Indy and Luck, but they're still probably going to win the division. This year's  AFC South might be the worst division since realignment in 2002. 
We always sacrifice something when we play Denver. :'(
Well the Hassel is back.^^^^^^God ^^^^^^I ^^^^^^need ^^^^^^a ^^^^^^drink
NOOOOOOOOOOO
http://i.imgur.com/ZlUEGgF.png
Fuck, Injuries blow
FUCK

U

C

K

**FUCK**
GOD. FUCKING. DAMMIT. 
The NFL should be freaking out trying to find a way to improve O-line play. Start up a D-league, adjust the CBA so O-linemen get way more time in the preseason to get coached, *some*thing!
damn that sounds brutal. does anyone have links to the hits? I dont remember getting him hit that hard.
GOOD LUCK Hasselbeck!
Man, what a rough year they've had.


And they might still win the AFC South even with everything that has happened.
Damn. What a tough dude.
The Colts should just get rid of Pagano and see if Byron Scott can pull double duty for awhile.
Holy shit this blew up!
Fucking hell, no rest for the Colts. So weird to think that they will probably still be the top team in their division - Hasselbeck is ancient but actually looked alright when he had to step up earlier this season.

This however could be the Texans big break to try and overtake them, the division race got quite a bit more interesting.
Damn, hearing that's very similar what put Keenan Allen on the IR.  Honestly wouldn't be surprised if this is being downplayed and he's ultimately out for the season.
Rib-Gate
This news is literally breaking /r/nfl
FUCK
Jesus. Tis the season of Kidney/Achilles/ACL injuries. Where are the kidney strength coaches at?!
This should be seen as a big middle finger to Ryan Grigson.  You can't make decisions that the coach should make, make a terrible O-Line and expect for Luck to not get nailed.

This dude needs to go.
http://ksi.uconn.edu/emergency-conditions/internal-trauma/kidney-injury/

&gt;Depending if the kidney was repaired, excised (removed), or left to conservative treatment, return to play may vary case-by-case, but full recovery may take up to three weeks, providing there are no complications.

and

&gt;Conservatively managed athletes with renal contusions should be observed until hematuria clears and should be excluded from contact sports for 6 weeks.  However, RTP is individualistic and depends on severity/intensity of the injury and the individual athlete. 
So we get to lose to a senior citizen huh?
Well this is a kick to the dick.
The architect and coach of that offensive line should be executed and hung in public 
ow
WHY GOD WHY.

Can we please get this man an Offensive Line?
Luck played out of his mind on Sunday. The amount of hits the Broncos put on him, especially when he scrambled, were insane. I was surprised he wasn't injured during. I love the way he played but man has to learn to dodge a punch. 
our chance is now
Wow, he really might be the toughest QB in the NFL. 
Well, now that it's gone, did anybody get a screencap of "new" during that andrew luck invasion.  I found it hilarious, and had some friends that missed the joke.
texans to the playoffs?
God. This is the nightmare season from hell.
Not surprised.  They were putting big hits on him all day. 
Good thing it's a bye week. 
I said during the game that he was going to hurt himself playing like that. The man played like he had a death wish, and he was hurt already. He's completely insane, got to respect that.
So.. At this point it's safe to say Luck is a Zombie right?  Dude shouldn't even be able to walk on the field at this point, like literally. 
Broken ribs + disgusting broncos pass rush = perforated internal organ

Shouldn't have been playing :/
Watching that game, I kept saying he was getting hit too hard too many times. 
I feel bad for him he has been getting his ass kicked all year
Ive only heard of like 2 'organ damage' incidents in the NFL over the last 5 years. Now this year we have Keenan Allen and Luck both with kidney damage in 2 weeks. WTF. 
How exactly does one lacerate a kidney in football?
What a tough son of a bitch
RG4?
Luck is in the intensive care
So uhhh, we're taking a fucking lineman next year, right?
H
I'm sure he'll be healthy again by the time we rematch to decide the winner of the AFC South in week 17  &gt;.&lt;
[Here is a video of the hit] (https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4/pnra.mp4)
[and the more brutal looking angle] (https://cdn.streamable.com/video/mp4/saev.mp4) 
Has to be one of the weirdest seasons ever for injuries. Ben is injured yet again. Leveon is down. Keenan Allen had kidney issues and I guess Luck has them to. Whatever happened to normal things like concussions and ligaments 
How far do you think he can throw a colostomy bag?
Fortunately he has a spare kidney.
My sister is a surgeon and says that the hits he took combined with some maybe not-totally-intact ribs could absolutely have caused these injuries. 

Dumb dumb dumb. 
Internal injuries freak me out. A quarterback at a high school near me died from an internal injury. I've heard several stories of people suffering some kind of trauma, they feel fine, and die a few hours later from internal bleeding.
I'm buying the Texans. I'm not sure how the Colts are going to respond or the Titans will do without Whiz, but I think the Texans get better after the bye. I know the Texans last game was against a divisional opponent (i.e. someone bad), but they looked a lot better. I think something happened after that Dolphins game. Also, Mallett just seems like a terrible, terrible teammate. I think the Texans are so much better off without him (regardless of if he's starting or benched).

Here's how I see the rest of the schedule:

Bengals - L

Jets - W

Saints - W

Bills - L

Pats - L

Colts - W

Titans - W

Jags - W

That's 8-8. I'm absolutely crazy and this probably won't happen. But it might. The Texans are better team than what has been shown IMO.




Still have the best QB in the AFC South.  Not worried.
I have so much respect and admiration for Luck, but he has got to take better care of himself on the field.
So that W, literally, was worth a kidney.
&gt; abdominal injuries

What, like BROKEN RIBS???
Good news for Indy.  They've had more wins with Hasselbeck than with Luck.
Those are injuries you only hear about in like extreme sports crashes or car wrecks.  Ouch.
JJ Watt + 2017 first round pick for Andrew Luck. 

Please. 

Grigson you're getting fired anyway you might as well. I'll Venmo you $100 too
With the way Denver was playing, something like this isn't nearly as shocking as it would typically be. Rest well, chances are strong the Division will still be within in grasp by that point.
It's going to suck when the afc south teams with 6 wins knocks out a 10 win wild card team. What a joke
I'm honestly okay with players celebrating, it's the beating of the women I'm concerned with.
Some say he should have had an excessive celebration penalty, some say he isn't old enough to get it.
He has a point.
Just watched the video. That was so funny. He goes full "stomp the yard" with a dance attack when that Titans player said something. 
Makes sense.Hasn't it always been this way?
True, but I'm surprised he didn't get an excessive celebration pregnant.  Is it just me or was that celebration long as a music video? 
[Cam should've hit him with this one](http://i.imgur.com/8uL6ZuL.gif)
I couldn't help but think of [Hingle McCringleberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJb2iLvOKE)

Especially when he kept dancing as the ref pushed him away.
Seriously, if you don't do your job, don't get mad when someone lets you know you didn't do your job
i'd say that's about the same length as the ray lewis dance
did anybody watch the video that was on the site though? what was the guy in the middle on about, saying that nobody is scared to play the Panthers. Saying [that any team could go into Carolina and beat them on their home turf in a playoff game.](http://media2.giphy.com/media/Fml0fgAxVx1eM/giphy.gif)

Lol it wasnt even that bad. The league is more fun when this stuff is allowed.
ODB's hamster style dances probably take up a similar length of time
Some stupid banner shit last week, some stupid excessive celebration shit this week.

What will they complain about next week I wonder.
He's 9-0, he can do whatever the hell he wants
Cam Newton seems like one of the most genuinely positive guys out there. He seems like he'd be a bro to anyone.
jesus christ who cares? Don't wanna hurt anybody's feelings on the other team I know 
Anyone got a video of it?

EDIT: Nevermind. I went and picked up my labtop and clicked the link. LMAO Cam has swag.
God I love this quote.
"if you don't like us dancing don't let us get into the endzone" 30 for 30-THE U
Cam is doing nothing different than a million players.  He celebrates when he scores.  The Titans players were clearly frustrated they were losing and that their season is not going well, and the one player started saying something to Cam.  We don't know what he said.  He could've been saying some shit.  Cam taunted him a little.  That's ALL that happened.  

Brady ran for a third down conversion on the first drive of the game and got up and screamed and pointed first down and was fired up in the same way Cam gets.  I don't hear shit about that.  We either want the NFL to stand for "No Fun League" or we want players with personalities to be themselves.  You guys who are getting all upset about this need to lighten up a little bit I think! 
He's not wrong. Cam has swag.
I'm fairly new to actually caring about the NFL, but why is celebrating looked so down on? I always hear the phrase "act like you've been there before," and I don't understand why. It seems like such a negligible thing to be so worried about how excited the players get when they score. 
" ¬Ø\  _ („ÉÑ) _  /¬Ø" -Cam Newton
Nobody has more fun playing football in the NFL than Cam Newton. Let him have some fun.
The double standards people apply to Cam Newton and no other quarterback in the league constantly astounds me. I don't want to say it's because of his race, but I'm not totally convinced that it isn't, which is a shame.  
  
And he has a point, he did a pretty standard TD dance and 2 Titans players got in his face, so he continued. I very likely would have done the same thing.
He's right, don't cry because you couldn't stop him. Don't whine and bitch because people are having fun at your expense to try and deflect from the fact that you're not good enough to stop them.
He's right, but that celebration was absurd. 
The man has a point. Here's to hoping that we don't see to much celebrating from him next week.
Yet Avery Wilson was celebrating his sack against Cam earlier in the game. 
This feels childish to me.  If you score you deserve to celebrate some and this goes both ways but shouldn't the bigger man just not further antagonize the situation? 
People seriously care this much about celebration? Sure he's rubbing it in their face, but he's not hurting them verbally or physically. Toughen up.
To paraphrase LT if you score, do whatever the fuck you want. We had 11 guys chasing your ass. 
Absolutely right. I love Cam. He's fantastic to watch. 
I mean... He's right.
I think he should celebrate bigger and HARDER  I loved when Johnson did it with the Bengals 
Why the fuck don't we allow elaborate celebrations anymore anyway? I miss the hell out of them
I'm sorry, what's the problem with this?  
Yeah, he's not wrong. Honestly if he keeps playing like this he might be playing in February with that defense.
To be fair: [They did try](https://www.profootballfocus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/2015-11-16_00-59-00.png)...I mean there's 4 guys there trying to stop him. Cam just happens to be a monster.
This makes me love Cam even more, I wish Steve Smith wouldn't have left because man the personality this team would have with Cam/Smith would make for A LOT of entertaining things.
I may be biased since I live in NC and I like the Panthers, but honestly, if Cam scored on my team I wouldn't even care if he celebrated. It's part of the game and it's not like he's a huge ass off the field like some other players.
Don't we want celebrations to come back. I miss that shit. 
He's right. I don't see what the big deal is, football is just a game, it's entertainment. Some people take football way too seriously.
SAVAGE
Who wouldn't want to see him flash that million-dollar smile?
I wish I could move like that 
As a Titans fan, he's right about that. We let him score too much.
I said it a few years ago about Sherman and I'll say it again: I don't care about "class" in the NFL. This is football, not ballroom dancing.
Cam Fucking Newton.
Cold blooded. I like it.
It's funny to me that this is a topic of such huge concern.

Yet look at the Seahawks last night.  Who was it that made a tackle to stop a run and the dude is celebrating and acting like he did something great.  Good you made a tackle...your fucking job.  stfu you are LOSING.

That is what people should be bitching about.  Because shit like that is fucking amateur hour.  Not Cam, or anyone else, celebrating a fucking TD.
Whatever happened to that ripping down the fans banner and taking it?
Cam celebrating last year - "You guys are winning your division w/ a losing record".  This year - "Act like you've been here before".  
If almost any other player did that, for the same amount of time he did, unsportsmanlike every time. 
I love my QB. 
That's been my philosophy for a long time. It goes hand in hand with my support for running the score up. A famous coach (I forget who, I think it was Lou Holtz) said "It's not my job to stop me". If you don't like celebrating or running the score up, stop em. 
Hey guys. This is the Titans player that was upset by Cam's celebration.  
  
http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/11/15/9739612/titans-lb-celebrates-play-with-his-best-drake-impression-hotline-bling
Why do so many players/coaches have an issue with him? Cam celly's just like every other player. You want to send a message then beat him
Reminds me of that pansy ass Keith brooking who cried when favre kicked the Cowboys asses in 09
I hate Cam's face but I completely agree.  Deal with it.
Take it from a baseball fan - your sport loses a lot of fun when players feel they can't celebrate for their victories.  Fuck that noise and let him dance.
i hate when people bring up "class". celebrating, talking smack is not a "class" issue. that's just a bullshit buzzword thrown out by senile football fans that hate seeing dudes have fun play the game....key word: GAME.

talk shit if you can back it up (Sherman), celebrate your touchdowns (Cam). it makes the sport more enjoyable to watch.

the NFL has some odd boner for limiting the competitiveness displayed by its athletes and i really can't figure out why. taunting should just fundamentally not be a penalty in a sport played by grown ass adults. 
Preach. How can the Titans bitch and whine? Their dude did the hotline bling dance on a sack
I dance with cam every time he scores. I like to think we are having a moment together.
Burn
if players dont dance like this, how will our white sons learn the urban dance moves?
Scoring sure, but Cam celebrates every time there is a first down. 
Dammit Cam. I try so hard to hate the Panthers. In a season of terrible losses, our loss to them may have been the most gut-wrenching. But I just love Cam Newton and how much fun he obviously has playing football.
This is why I fucking love Cam
I can't believe that celebration is looked down on in this sport, lol. These butthurt Titans should be glad they aren't a soccer franchise
I have 0 issues w/ Cam or any player celebrating most of the time, but it did kinda bother me last year when Cam's team would be down 2+ possessions in a game and he'd still be celebrating. 

I get it, it's a game that they love, but at certain times I feel like a QB, being a team's focal point, has to rally the troops and keep an even keel demeanor.
The problem is his celebrations are not funny like Chad Johnson or even Steve Smith, Cam just comes off like a jackass. 
Cam went to the U?
He said through his brilliant smile. 
That's right.  If you don't like it.  Fucking stop it.  Or stfu.

Thanks.
Cam's right
I do think the guy acts kind of childish on the field, and celebrates a bit to much. Honestly, act like you've been there before. Maybe I'm the minority but it gets kind of annoying.
Man there are a bunch of people who seem awfully concerned with the feelings of men who are gigantic millionaires. "Rubbing it in their face?" Are you kidding me?
Can somebody make a gif of cam doing that dance after the ref comes over?
When the qb runs at your d and dunks it on them on the goal line you have no right to complain about the td dance 
hundred percent agree.


these people are fucking professionals. cant stand people who cry about their hurt feelings at this level.
Lmao his reaction to that Titans defender is perfect. Stop making it hard for me to hate you you magnificent bastard. 
Dab Newton hoe.
Heh.
I don't know if I wanna' go putting chips on the shoulders of a young team that could develop into a divisional monster in 2-3 years... but you bucket, Cam.
On one hand, I agree with Cam. (Just typing that makes me fucking sick.)

On the other hand, is it really necessary for him to hold up the game for 5 minutes while he does his stupid dance, high fives all his teammates, goes to find the ball to give to a kid in the stands and then high fives the kicking unit as he runs off the field?
Read the first part of the title and thought there was some blockbuster trade.  
Anyone have a video of the celebration?
Where can I see the video?
Runnin to get the 6 with my woes
He can dance if he wants to, he can leave his friends behind..
So, lowkey the Titans are one of the saltiest franchises in the NFL. Apparently.

Like, calm down guys. You don't say shit when anyone else does it, and that Titans player should have just thrown down *his* best dance moves if he was gonna start talking shit. It's the only acceptable response. Best sequence gets 6, best individual move gets the extra point.
Is this thread a good representation  of NFL reddit? If so, I don't really wanna associate with you people anymore
Im sorry but if he keeps this up players are going to try and hurt him hope it doesn't come to that but it will if he doesn't stop baseball isn't the only sport with a code.
Never been a fan of excessive celebration penalties, but its kind of disappointing to see such poor sportsmanship from such a huge athlete like Cam.
What a fuckin gangster.
Damn he's cool
Get owned Titans!! No even a Panther  fan, but damn that game tho
LOOK AT MY DAB
but why you mad bro? probably because you used to call Ken Whisenhunt coach lmao 
Lol fuk
I didn't have a problem with him dancing. I had a problem with what his dancing was. So weird looking. I am not hip to these new dances.
Dab on dem folks.
I just want to know how he's being talked about as a MVP candidate?  He hasn't been nearly as good as Dalton and Carson
Probably the douchiest response ever
 Well, I'm coming late to a thread with an unpopular opinion, but I'm going to say it anyways; Cam's celebrations are "over the top". It's okay to celebrate a touchdown, but it seems like he does it all the time. I just think he scores so much, he should act like he's been there before. 

 It's a competitive game, and some of these guys are just trying to feed their families - no need to go showboating in their face.  It's okay to be a little humble too - it doesn't make you a robot to respect the people around you.

 But in the end, no one should be "offended" by Cam Newton's dancing. Even if he's being malicious - it's just a little dance in the endzone. As a player, you should get back to the sideline and let your team worry about the next play. As a fan of the Panthers, you're probably happy that you just scored. As a fan of the opposing team, you're probably happy that your QB isn't a grown man trying to compare himself to Superman.
Douchiest qb in the league. Dumbest td celebration in the league. But he's one of the best.
Cam better watch out. As last night's fight shows, people love a bragger almost as much as people love watching a bragger get knocked the fuck out.
I guarantee 99% of you wouldn't be saying what you are if it was your team, get fucked.

Cam Newton is an asshole. Fuck him and I take back everything good I said about him.
Hilarious, and he has a point, but celebrating a score against the Titans is like celebrating after hitting a home run in your child's little league game.
Cam is a bully right?
When the Panthers lose in the playoffs I'm going to approach every Panther fan I see and do that dance right in their face while wearing my Avery Williamson jersey. Would it be excessive then?
He's sort of right... but he also should get a taunting penalty almost every time he scores.
I totally understand, but I do think Cam has been a bit excessive this year so far. Kind of obnoxious but gotta love the guy
When someone like Cam does it you all eat it up

When someone like Steve Smith and Johnny Manziel do it they're huge douchebags


same retarded comment he always has.
Act like you've been there before and you'll be there again. If you want to make some kids day by giving them a ball then go for it, dancing after every big play is excessive. 
He should have absolutely been given a taunting flag. I'm all for celebrations and I agree with the general idea of "if you don't like it, stop it", but he went over the top. Cam is getting better as a QB but is still an immature player.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxi73RQlLB8

Cam's song.
If you don't stop me I am allowed to do anything!
Sorry Cam, but you just jinxed yourself.  No Superbowl for you this year.  You just got on the wrong side of karma and the Football Gods.  RIP

EDIT - I want to apologize to Panthers fans for this joke that offended so many of them.  I admit that I do not know how the Football Gods actually feel.  I was being silly and immature, and I'm sorry.

I would like to say that I'm glad to see some Panthers fans alive and well.  I'm sure the 9-0 record has nothing to do with the surprising amount of Panthers fans that have appeared.  I'm sure living in South Carolina my whole life and rarely seeing any Panthers fans is just a funny coincidence.  Great job, Panthers fans!  Congrats on your great season!  It's great to see the stadium packed like it never has been before!
Or we could go back to the old days, where the next play one D lineman will hold you up while the next dives at your knees. Don't gloat at someone who has the ability to end your career. Nothing brings on the desire to cheap shot more.
Yeah you're right Cam.  However, it's still kind of annoying.
Go sit on a hammer, Cam.
Let's see if the NFL fines Cam ... after they put this celebration on the official @NFL twitter with language praising Cam. They want it both ways: this is good when the league says so, and bad a few days later because the league said so.
Kaepernick uses cams celebration after scoring, everyone mad.

Cam Newton celebrates, everyone happy.
Damn that dance is annoying to watch. 
Full speed -&gt; Facemask

Slo mo -&gt; no call

Unfortunately; officials don't throw flags after looking at a play in slow motion
I always feel bad for defenders. Nobody ever is shooting for the facemask. All of the sudden the quarterback is at a lower position and you are reaching....and boom facemask. 
Jesus Christ, you'd think the Vikings lost this game judging by the comments I've read
Refs aren't robots with slow motion camera eyes. They saw it in real time and none had a clear view because of the laterals going on.

Once it happened i yelled it was a facemask. I was wrong, but it 100% appeared so in real time. It was the wrong call, but i completely understand why it was called
I just don't get how the Defense played that last play so fucking poorly. How was there not one person in front of the cluster of Packers to try to knock it down?
I'm fine with the face mask call. Real time, I understand. But if you're going to call that, you have to call the blatant hold on the last play. 
Having a night to think about this play, who cares? The lions need to learn to finish a game and not even leave it in the refs hands. This is why Caldwell has to go.
Do they need a replay to see this? https://i.imgur.com/HRwdqxq.jpg
Pretty much how I saw it, the refs will call that every time, whether it's Rodgers or Manziel
It looked like a flag in real time. Everyone here thought so till you saw the slow-mo replay from the perfect angle. We would have all thrown our flag in that situation.
[Doesn't say it's the right call, just that it's a judgment call.  ](https://twitter.com/MikeGarafolo/status/672643315704004608)
Exactly. In real time, I'm sure there wasn't a shadow of doubt in the ref's mind. It absolutely looked like a face mask. 
I don't know why a penalty that would give a team an untimed down to decide victory isn't reviewable.
just an idea, but why not make it so any penalties in the two minute warning are also reviewed?
I'm less mad about the penalty and more mad about the fact that Megatron wasn't on the field for that last play
I don't think any sane person can be upset that they called it on the field. The fact that such a massive play (and other penalties) aren't reviewable is what everyone should be upset about
#Fine lets say its bs, Lions still could have won by knocking it down or stopping Rodgers. 
Bottom line nowadays: You have to keep your hand off your opponent's facemask. It really isn't that hard to understand. If you touch your opponent's facemask, don't be surprised when you get a facemask penalty. Fundamental tackling principles would never put a defender's hand on the opposition's facemask. Period.
Complain about the refs, but the lions had chances to win before and after the penalty.  [Six short defenders in the end-zone and all behind packers receivers?](https://i.imgur.com/A44q6uR.jpg)
Man this might be very very late to the party, but I hope someone reads. The NFL and college used to have a rule for separate face mask penalties. Under the old rule this would have been a 5 yard facemask. Its a shame they got rid of it for safety reasons? who knows, but if they had kept that rule in place the ball would have been placed at the GB 28. Is a 72 yard pass possible by Rodgers, I think doubtful. Also the 5 yarder was not an automatic first, so It would have been 4th down(not that it matters).
No one's talking about how it's a shit tackle in the first place, so the flag is deserved either way. Devin Taylor got cocky and threw Rodgers to the ground. Sure, anyone who's a DL and has to play Green Bay two times a year might want to do the same, but holy shit, he didn't have to throw Rodgers to the ground. All he had to do was contain him and prevent him from pretty much gaining a single yard, not grab and throw him like a doll.

Officials made the right call. Fuck slow mo, fuck rationalizing fans, or rather the ones who justify the loss as "well, if the refs didn't [x]" and pretend they didn't just get ass-reamed by their own team.
Clearly a makeup call for that Cardinals NFC WC game in 2009.

/s
I watched the game at a bar and the sound was muted. Shocked to find the call was questioned. 
I like how we (Lions fans) aren't even allowed to sit and sulk in our own suckage. The NFL always comes and goes "Yeah you guys pretty much fucking blew it, buuuuuutttttt we kind of fucking blew it too so you guys should have never have even had the chance to blow it"... Fuck this. Im salty
I don't think there was any grab, but I do think it's impossible to make the right call
At full speed. Which brings up the real issue - why can't a game altering penalty be reviewed?
and it's the QB

will get called every time 
I don't think anyone blames the ref for throwing the flag. At full-speed I would bet everyone watching on TV and in the stadium thought it was a clear penalty.

The bigger issue is that penalties should be review-able in the last 2 minutes...
"The officials and umpires are part of the game to be played around. They may be good, they may be bad, but you've got to adapt. They're part of the game." - synopsis, all of my coaches, ever. 
Dean Blandino has never referee'd a game in his life, its a joke that  he is head of Officiating. 
Ok, but was it a facemask or not?
The ref from behind could never have seen if it was a facemask or not.  The ref looking right at it did not throw a flag.  They shouldn't guess.
Tbh, I understand completely the reasoning for penalties being reviewed, but what would that do to the pace of the game if penalties were reviewable?
At full-speed, of course. At slo-mo, it's close. Even if the call were to get upheld, I think it's really hard to justify why close, pivotal calls like that can't be reviewed *using the technology we already have implemented*. It's not like goal line cameras that would take more equipment and logistics to set up.
Maybe Bill Belichick is right, every call should be able to be challenged and reviewed. Didn't have a dog in this fight but the Lions got hosed. I hate bad officiating in any game.
I haven't seen Blandino disagree with any major calls this year.  He would've agreed either way with this.  He is Goodell's puppet monkey.
The Lions were winning 20 to 0. Then they failed to score a touchdown in the second half. Same thing happened vs Dallas in playoffs last year. Started out ahead 17-7, then failed to score a touchdown in the second half, coming up with a grand total of 3 points in the 3rd and ZIP in the 4th.

Yet it's all bout that one call that didn't go their way rather than their team laid an egg after half time, and there was a controversial call during the course of letting the other team with more fight scratch and claw their way back. It's like they're so used to their team being bad that the badness just becomes background noise to the indignity of fate or fortune intervening not on their behalf. 
Second time this year the Lions got fucked by a bad call at the end of the game.
yeah well, don't blow a 17 point lead in the first and it doesn't matter.
http://gfycat.com/SmoggyHarshFlee

Arm across stomach, defender is already around the linemen, at full speed they will call this every time. Wait just kidding.
"It will get called most of the time" is not the same as "it was the correct call" - it was still an incorrect call.
NFL Head to Quarterbacks: If you want 5 to 15 yards, just turn your head any time a defender reaches above your chest level.
I can get what they are saying but it's still a wrong call. Doesn't the CFL let you challenge penalties? Why not allow a coach one as well? I mean at full speed I can get what they see, but looking at the replay it wasn't a grab/twist/pull of the face mask. 
Thank god for some logic, my facebook feed is filled with idiots complaining about the call but unless you want the two minutes of football to have every play under review, this missed call is fine.

Just came at a bad time since the refs are getting murdered this year with horrible decisions. This missed facemask should not fall under that category because I guarantee any ref in that position with the way that played out is throwing a flag there everytime.

And please don't say it should be reviewable, then we're going to review holding calls, PI, block in the backs, etc and the pace of a NFL game will be as fucking horrible as ever.


"The speed of the game is logarithmically faster?" That's one of the most r/iamverysmart phrases ever uttered.
Make it reviewable. 
I feel like there should be a review referee booth crew. The guys on the field throw flags when they think they see a penalty, but nothings really called yet. The instant the guys up in booth go straight into the replays from where he threw the flag and start looking for a penalty. If they see one, they phone it down to the head ref the instant the play is over, and he'll either say, "Facemask #98 defense" or just quickly say "There is no foul on the play." 

I feel like we have the technology to make that happen in real time.
We're at a tipping point, technology-wise. Everyone has HDTV and slow-motion replay via a button on the couch. Every viewer at home essentially has better access to what's happening on the field than the referees do.

This should not be acceptable. Referees are being called out this year, for sure, but it seems more likely that they've just always been terrible. The difference now is that the people at home can prove it.

Bad calls should not determine the outcome of a game.
but then how could the NFL bless the packers with wins ? 
was one of the worst phantom facemasks i can recall, for sure in recent memory anyways... that it was game winning call to is just maddening
Yeah it was a blown call, but that's not what lost the lions the game. Allowing Rodgers to throw a 61 yard bomb with 0 seconds left and all of your DB's playing behind the WR's is what lost you the game
There was no ". . .quick grab with the finger . . ."
As Head of Officiating, he should teach the officials to call the rule then... http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/12/04/facemask-rule-as-written-wasnt-violated-by-lions/
I agree it was the wrong call, but without looking at the replay, I don't see how it would be possible to NOT make that call.

Going at full speed and the tips touching the face mask going at that angle, my head would automatically turn to try and not hurt my neck, so I dont blame Rodgers for it either.

It sucks, but I would be more upset that my team gave up a 20-0 lead at home at half time than the call.
imagine if this was for a superbowl. 
it 100% looked like a facmask even though it wasn't. that will be called every single time, its just unfortunate it happened when it did. after all the game changing penalties that have been happening this year, I hope they change something. they NEED to change something. the better team did not win tonight because of a bad call and that should never happen
The answer is obviously that we need to inject our referees with some kind of serum that gives them the superpower of slowing down their perspective of time.  I can't believe with all their billions of dollars, the NFL hasn't done this yet.
If your team can't stop a 61-yard Hail Mary with no time left, you can't really blame anything on the officials. I'm sorry but if you give up that play, you deserve to lose every time.
You're all so fucking mad
Well this was totally expected.
Just make all 15-yard and spot foul penalties  reviewable!
How about the lions just defend the Hail Mary better? No one would have remembered anything about the penalty had the next play not resulted in a packers TD. Lions had plenty of opportunities to not blow a 20 point lead. Blame the refs if you want, they certainly have blown a lot of important calls this year, but your team should never let it have to come down to a call like that at the end of the game. 
The refs have so much influence on the score of the game. And it make it less enjoyable to watch. The penalties should be reviewable. 
I get this, but it's still the wrong call.
I mean really, it makes sense. In real time, that is obviously going to be called 9/10 times, but that doesn't make me feel better about it.
It was still the wrong call. 
If they hadn't thrown the flag I guarantee this sub would be full of people bitching about the game ending on a bad no call.
Why is there no challenging flags? Or at least a review or something...
We got bailed out there. These 2 Lions games this year have both had crazy ass endings. In real time I can understand the call. I've seen far worse calls before. Still if you lose on a 65 yard hail mary, you can't be that salty. Both teams suck this year anyway. 
THANK YOU! Reviewable penalties or non-calls inside two minutes. Lions would've had two more wins this season. Not on officials to have fast motion vision.

This is on the rulebook, not the refs.
Real time or not, the ref who threw the flag was behind the play and didn't even have a view of Rodgers face mask to begin with. So fuck them and anyone defending this call because it was "real time"
At the end of the Seattle game, Lions fans were told that "They shouldn't want to win on the back of a penalty and they shouldn't have put themselves in a position where they needed it. Plus it was a ticky tacky call when the game was already over."

At the end of this game, Lions fans are now being told that "The refs are always going to call penalties at the end of games like this and they shouldn't put themselves in position to lose due to a penalty."

Which is it?
Every time eh? 

http://imgur.com/9EWvo6n.jpg
[Alternate angle of the facemask](http://i.imgur.com/fA9xyby.png)
Remember the playoff game against Arizona? We get how it feels.


Here is what the Rule book says:

#ARTICLE 14

  
**TWISTING, PULLING, OR TURNING THE FACEMASK.**
No player shall grasp and control, twist, turn, push, or 
pull the facemask of an opponent in any direction. 

*Note: If a player grasps an opponent‚Äôs 
facemask, he must immediately release it. If he does not immediately release it 
and controls his opponent, it is a foul.*
 
Penalty: For twisting, turning, pushing, pulling, or controlling the mask: Loss of 15 yards. The player may be 
disqualified if the action is flagrant. If the foul is by the defense, it is also an automatic first down. 
They blew a 20-0 lead and lost on a Hail Mary. Stop it with this missed call. 
But that's not the fucking rule. The rule literally has a this sentence in it: ‚ÄúIf a player grasps an opponent‚Äôs facemask, he must immediately release it. If he does not immediately release it and controls his opponent, it is a foul.‚Äù
Okay, even if it wasn't a 15 yarder, He still made contact with the facemask. He was getting called for that anyway. It's still an untimed down and the lions decided not to defend the hail mary.
It becomes a who saw it. I know my flair is showing, but how many times have we all seen a flag get thrown that was baseless and how many times did we not see it get thrown? I thought the refs were on strike Monday night.

Everyone is going to look at this as it was a stolen win, but evidence points to how the official called it. When we all slow it down with our DVRs we can all see what it was or wasn't it, but I think even their replay wouldn't provide indisputable evidence to overturn it.
I said this right after it happened in the post game thread. You see the helmet turning before Rodgers goes down, any ref who sees that will immediately throw the flag. And I don't think the helmet turned via "pushing" but rather "pulling" which makes it a face mask. In slo-mo it's probably the ticky-tackiest call ever, by definition, sure it is but if you called every instance of that a facemask it would be called every play. Just happened to get his pinky finger caught in the facemask as he was making the tackle one way while Rodgers was turning the other way.
So, per the head of officiating...does that make [this](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/chunghold.gif?w=650) a facemask, OPI, or a defensive hold?
I really wish challenging penalties (or lack thereof) was a thing but I can see how this call was made and I'm completely upset. After all, the Lions got away with pass interference just 2 plays before.
I like how everyone is acting like that penalty is what lost them the game when the Packers still had to go and complete a 61 yard hail mary.  They earned that win...
But...but... I didn't want the Packers to win! When will the NFL start to consider my feelings in late-game decisions?
"almost every time" Stop trying to cover your ass Blandino. show some consistency in your calls or at least make them challengable.
Quick grab with the finger. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
I don't see why the refs can't have a tablet on them so they can quickly review plays from the cameras angles that we see for game changing calls. 
I'd like to see all you big mouthed motherfuckers that think you could make the right call in that scenario go out and actually go through referee training then.
I get that it looked like it, and AAron did a good job of making it look worse. I just dont have to like it.
The fact that they're feeling they need to explain themselves show that they know the fans don't trust them. And that tells a lot.
I agree the call gets made 10x/10 but that doesn't mean that they're making the call correctly, and that's what we need to have a system in place to change.  
  
That wasn't Facemasking, but the Ref had to use a judgment call and threw the flag.  
  
I think 1) Refs need to be reminded that if they aren't 100% sure about a call that they cannot call a penalty (a la tennis where if you're not sure it's out you can't call it out even if you think it is), and 2) you gotta have some sort of 3rd party review of penalties like that.  
  
Sorry Lions you won that game and had bad judgment take it away from you. 
 I like how he doesn't address the fact that it wasn't a facemask, just trying to justify it by saying that they'll always call it because it's close.
I'm still more pissed at the holding AND the block in the back on the final play.
This is the same person who justified the "no catch" for Dez Bryant, and the "picking up the flag" for Detroit against Dallas, and EVERY OTHER BAD CALL made by officials. Of course he is going to side with the officials in the game because if he doesn't than the refs would be held accountable and we can't have that.
I mean, I am biased and i know that, I don't think the hit deserved the flag but in real time it did look like this head got pulled (even though when you slow it down you can see its his shoulder getting hit)

I do think this is a good spot for reviewable (sp?) defensive penalties. I like getting the win but no reason that a team should get a win basically stolen froim them like it was today.
In answer to all situations, don't put yourself in it.
&gt;Hand up to the mask, quick grab with finger and head gets turned. At full speed official is going to make that ~~call~~ mistake ~~almost~~ every time.

Fixed.
And thats why making a rule that hinges on the reaction of the "victim" is asking for trouble.  

It doesn't look like Rodgers was trying to sell anything there, but obviously a head turn doesn't require that someone yanked on his facemask.  
  
For me, the worst part of any sport is when athletes try to sell a foul - basketball, soccer and even football (punters are the worst IMO), and it disgusts me every time.  That is one of those things that I hate to see even my own teams doing.  
  
But, if refs are going to rely on the actions of the victim to make the call, this is what you get.
EXCEPT THE FUCKING REF STANDING IN FRONT OF IT THAT COULD ACTUALLY SEE IT *DIDN'T* THROW A FLAG, SO OBVIOUSLY NOT DEAN "FUCK YOU" BLANDINO
Guy always sides with the officials. It was a bad call.
It was a better acting job by Rodgers than an actual facemask... Lions got ripped.
Fuck the wrong call.  I don't care.  I'm celebrating that badass Hail Mary!
&gt;"almost every time"

nice
Blandino is an idiot and was also exposed for have never even having ref experience before. And of course he'll rationalize some bullshit in order to defend this.


The call was wrong. Grazing the facemask with your thumb or any incidental contact is NOT a penalty. There has to be a tug or pull. Read more [here](http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/11/when-is-grabbing-the-facemask-not-a-facemask-penalty/). 



Also, the ref who saw the play head-on/from the front, didn't throw his flag. The ref who was behind the play and had Rodgers' back facing him threw the flag. He literally just guessed/assumed it was a facemask.



No football fan should be ok with this garbage week after week after week after week. 
This is tearing me apart because I don't think it should be a face mask call. I think that rarely do players purposely grab face masks and throw a ball carrier down and I wish they would use video review on these things to get them right. However there's a part of me that's starting to think that football has become too complex and no one understands any rules anymore. And the face mask was touched and the helmet moved but that was by no fault of the lions defender. Rogers dropped his head after he was bringing his arm to grab Rogers
This is a penalty regardless. A face mask? No. In real time, that looked to be the case, but in slow mo, it wasn't. However, it is at the very least, illegal hands to the face. Still a penalty, still get one more shot, albeit from 10 yards farther out. But really, people can be as pissed as they want at the refs, in real time, it looked like the right call, so deal with it. 
That doesn't make it right, though.
Once again we're going to blame the refs because a team can't hold a large lead?  And in this case can't stop a hail mary pass.  
&gt;At full speed the official is going to screw up that call almost every time

Yeah, we know.  Stop making excuses and train your officials better.
I can see why Lions fans might think it's a BS call... but it really isn't that bad. Can't blame the refs for that one.
The lesson here is of you're about to get tackled around the chest or shoulder, jerk your head towards the opponents hand to get a redo!
Remember that one time that refs missed a few other calls earlier in the game?????
I don't see a quick grab. 
Maybe a rule change next season or something.
It honestly wasn't the worst call/non-call this game.  It's just the one with the biggest impact, but I agree with that take - in real time it's pretty easy to think it was a facemask.  A review system for the final 2 minutes would be nice.

Or just not fucking up all the previous calls in the game.  That would be even nicer.
If the coach has a challenge he should be able to review a flag thrown against his team.
https://twitter.com/PrideOfDetroit/status/672652078607503360
If only we had access to slow motion video that we could use to clarify game changing play calls. Wouldn't that be a crazy future world, eh?
I understand it would be called, but why didn't the refs confirm it with all the replay available? 
NFL defending their shit calls? Surprised. 
[The referees are worse than Tom Haverford as a referee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV1lro1Z694)
https://youtu.be/kmBgptnhP9E
That was a dumb fucking penalty anyways.  Rodgers already threw the ball and Devin Taylor decides he needs to rush the tackle instead of just wrapping Rodgers the fuck up
It sucks when you sack the QB, only to have the refs give the other team another chance on a marginal call
Except the refs in the Bills game, last week, twice. 
i'm tired of being at the center of controversial officiating calls.
If you dont see a hand on the mask it's not a facemask and you shouldnt make the call, dipshit. 
Refs are now making the one mistake you can't make in officiating, they assume calls, you should only call what you see not what you think happened 
This is the second bad call in as many weeks made by a ref with a poor angle on the play. Why do you guys huddle and talk about it if you don't go with the ref that has the superior viewing angle?

Unless the ref in the back has X-ray vision I can't justify that flag being thrown by him. Maybe the one in front of the play, but the guy behind shouldn't be calling a penalty he couldn't possibly see. 
I think the entire thing would be solved if refs had cameras.

It would truly change how people judge the refs I think when you're given just a split second to make the call.
"quick grab with finger" LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOOLOL
That doesn't mean the call was correct.   That means NFL needs to review these.  Especially if it puts time on the clock
It wasn't a facemask though
None of this would happen if the Lions could properly defend a hail mary.  We wouldn't even be talking about any of this.
This is why penalties should be reviewable. Is the minute and a half it would take to overturn this call that big of deal? Maybe one day we will not allow an incorrect call cost a team a win.
If you don't know for sure don't throw the flag. Way too big of a penalty.
Packers get the call they need in the clutch.  Again.

Lather. Rinse. Repeat.
What about the mauling of Teddy's facemask that was a no call 2 weeks ago and the open palm push to Rodgers' chest that was roughing the passer? I just am tired of seeing the favorable calls always fall to the packers.
He didn't grab it lmao, his thumb grazed over it as he grabbed him by the shoulder, plus his head is already turned to his shoulder as he's tackled. Why couldn't they review this?

http://gfycat.com/FamousHugeBrownbutterfly
This rule just flat out sucks. What is the defensive player do when his finger is in the facemask and he takes it out right away? Why is this a 15 yard penalty? 
Official cannot see the play, makes the call anyways.
Correction: an official will make that call every single time for Rodgers.*
Bad call. End of story. They got a free play when the game should have been over.
How about reviewing game outcome changing calls in the last two minutes? The lions have participated in at least two games where they probably would have ended with a win and another game (Chicago) that they would have lost. (Was Tate's "catch" in the last two minutes? Can't remember)
the fact that he said "almost every time" is just reaffirming to me that we need calls to be reviewable
NFL = Corrupt Organization

As a long time Detroit fan, I have no mercy for you NFL.  You know what happens when you start [phantom calling Detroit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSHGG0sGUOc).  Welcome to the [new era of the NFL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XNqYf03Qk0).  #FuckRefs #FuckMarkets #WeWillWin  #YouWillCry 
Seems like these type of calls are going to continue to happen so long as you allow QBs to use single-strap chin straps. Had Rodgers been wearing a helmet that was more secure to his head, there may have been less movement of his helmet, and the ref may have been less inclined to make the call. A loose helmet seems like an easy way to draw a facemask call if you can sell it right 
The NFL needs to make penalties at the end of a game that would have a direct impact on the outcome of the game reviewable. If I was Martha Ford I would make a huge deal about it because how many times are the Lions going to let the refs fuck them.
I think people (read:Lion Fans) are so upset because within one calender year they / we have been screwed by shit calls on three ocassions. 
If they make penalties review-able, isn't it just going to make games take forever?  And how do you call PI when the defender and offensive player are pushing each other?

It isn't going to get more consistent, it is going to get less consistent!
What about the missed holding and block in the back call?
Rodgers is absolutely brilliant at using penalties. I've said it before and this is a good example because he won them the game on it (or, more fairly, he stopped them from losing the game, which put him in position to make a great throw).

He lowers and turns his head so that a thumb *brushes* his facemask (in no universe did it grab or turn his head) as he's being sacked. He then goes to the ground, dishevels his helmet (no, the "facemask" grab didn't take his chinstrap off or disorient his helmet at all), and comes up crying foul, making sure to make himself looked raped.

Seriously, anyone claiming that his helmet was twisted or his face turned is an idiot. Rodgers pulled his head in protectively and turned to the defender. You can see the defenders thumb loosely moving because it was putting no pressure at all.

Flag is thrown. The flag was thrown after Rodgers protested, not as a result of the play. I mean...if it wasn't a facemask, he wouldn't protest right?

Refs should never fall for acting. Flags should *never* come as a result of protesting. In this case it was a ref who couldn't even see the supposed penalty but called on Rodgers' claims.

And this quote is hilarious. He isn't saying it's a penalty. 
https://i.imgur.com/vJlHE1n.jpg
tl;dr: Dean Blandino is still a fucking moron.

ETA:

http://www.nfl.com/static/content/public/image/rulebook/pdfs/15_Rule12_Player_Conduct.pdf
Aaron Rodgers just called it a legitimate facemask... that's all I need.
How many mistakes did the players make today?

How many times have players made mistakes that cost teams games?
Dear Lionsbros:  I am sorry that this is 3 times in 2 years you have been screwed by such bullshit.  The NFL has some explaining to do to your organization
ANother game decided by the officials- Will not be renewing my sunday ticket next year. 
All of this proves that packers = bitches
RESIGN
Everyone in here bitching about not being able to challenge flags will be in here again bitching about how they couldn't challenge a game winning TD at 2:01 to go because there are only so many challenges and they got used on bullshit subjective penalties like DPI. 

Also that games now last 4-4.5 hours with all these penalties under review. Do you really want another 5-7 viewings of the Fan Duel victories? 
The NFL is a fucking joke. 
There was no grab...
Slow-mo replay brings more detriment than good, as ironic as it may sound. Live, watching the game, you know for a damn fact that appeared to be a face mask live and everyone was expecting a flag. Live, during the game if you were a ref, you'd throw a flag, I'd throw a flag, all of us would. One referee mentioned the con of instant replay on how you can make it seem like anything is a catch/not a catch or a flag/not a flag. Instant replay is causing even more madness than it is sanity. 
'If it's Rodgers going down looking for a flag, at full speed an official is going to make that call almost every time'

'If it's Drew Brees and he fights the defender, that's roughing almost every time'

Good system we got here. Whether it's a penalty is not the issue, it's the consensus of the referees. Nice.
I mean his thumb hooked the facemask for half a second. I'm not sure how much it needs to be to be a penalty but whatever. Real time that gets called 99/100 times.
Aaron Rodgers is like one of those diving Soccer players... lol
At full speed the ref is going to make that every time if its against Brady or Rodgers. 

FTFY
Total horseshit from the NFL as usual.  Dean Blandino needs to be fired.  
http://gfycat.com/FamousHugeBrownbutterfly

"At full speed official is going to make that call almost every time."

And yet it's not reviewable for a slow mo *double check*.  See, you can even sponsor it.  So nice of him to go out of his way to say "anyone would make that call" though because he **can't** say it was the right call.

Fuck you, Deano.
"Packers won so it's all good!" - da league
But I saw it in slow motion and i should have been the one to make that call on the field!
This isn't nearly as bad as the batted ball in the Seattle-Detroit game. But that doesn't mean we should just accept what happened. Rather, the blame doesn't fall on the officials. It falls on the NFL. I've been repeating myself for the past few days, but I'll say it again. It's a multibillion dollar organization. They can afford a combination of a) ironing out the rule book to make things more clear for fans and officials (not a huge issue this time) and b) fixing the refereeing situation through brute force, whether it's by having 40 people in a room upstairs viewing each play in real time and/or some other means.
... Except for everyone not named Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and Payton Manning. 
a few years ago they changed the rule of face mask from inadvertent face mask which was a slight grab but release and a 15 which was a blatant face mask this would have been a 5 yard inadvertent face mask since those dont exist anymore even a slight grab would call for a 15yard face mask penalty i think its the right call   
The call wasn't perfect, but the lions should have also been able to stop a hail mary
It really wasnt that bad of a call. Just an odd moment to make it. None of this is an issue if the lions dont lions the shit out of the last play. Id be more upset if it was part of a string of 1 sided calls. As far as i can tell it was not.
That's an argument that old men on the feild being in charge is a none working system 
The play would have been upheld on challenge too. The rule does not specify length of duration. Even incidental, minor contact is considered a 15-yard penalty. 

This is not a new debate. There were complaints before when there was a 5-yard incidental facemask and a separate 15-yard facemask penalty that led to the league changing the rule.

Under the old rule, this would have been a 5-yard penalty, but because the new rule does not specify length of facemask contact this was technically the correct call.

It sucks but there is little that replay would have done to ameliorate this situation.
it was ALSO a 'contact to the qb's head', which is the same 15 yd penalty. take your pick. easy call
Refs are calling that almost 100% of the time. The QB's noggin is off limits. Period. 
Can't fault the refs here. It's a face paced game and they watch it in real time. 

Face mask penalties should be re viewable. Allow challenges on some penalties, like face masks, or DPI. Problem solved.  
I fucking hate this "full speed" excuse. On every play, there is a right call and a wrong call. Don't give me any bullshit just make the right fucking call.
Rodgers head was clearly yanked back. His chin strap wound up settling around his nose. How could that happen without the facemask being pulled? It was only one finger that hooked in there, but one finger is enough when a very strong, very fast person wearing very sticky gloves is running in the opposite direction as the ball carrier.

It's worth noting that the same thing happened to Josh Sitton on the Packers earlier in the game. Starks caught a screen pass for 30 yards that was called back because of an accidental facemask while blocking that rather resembled the call on Rodgers. It was clearly the right call, especially since the defender might have tackled Starks had his head not been diverted.

It is also worth noting that on the play before the Rodgers facemask call, the refs arguably blew a pass interference where the defender ranger straight into Jeff Janis deep downfield. Had that been called by the book, the Packers would have been in field goal range down 2 with no need for a hail Mary.

But that's neither here nor there. Not only was the facemask call correct, it was obvious to anyone watching the game in real time. Even in slo mo you can clearly see the head turn as a direct consequence of the fingers catching the face mask. There is no story here.
Everyone saying we need replays for fouls near the end of the game...This foul would have been upheld on review.  The player touched the facemask (although briefly), which would be the only reviewable part of such a replay.  

After that, it's a judgment call on if there's enough grasping and turning off the head to warrant a flag, and judgment calls are not and never will be reviewable.

I'm all for making calls like offsides and illegal formation fouls reviewable, but here we have a case where contact was made with the facemask, so the foul would have had to be upheld.     
Even in slow mo it still looks like a penalty.  Rodgers head is jerked to the side when the defenders thumb hooked into it. 
[Picture of me just hanging right now](http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200905/r367595_1704008.jpg)
So the next time a bad call goes against the Packers, we'll hear the same rationalization from them, right?

"Its a tough call to make. Looked like a penalty in real time"

Not incessant whining? I wont hold my breath.
All I know is I don't want to hear another fucking word about the fail mary
So if they dont go to LA like they don't want to and San Diego wont keep them....do they just fold?
This truly is the worst season I have experienced as a football fan.

I'm trying to find a positive for Chargers fans but I can't this blows.
[Yeah, neither will anyone else.](https://mobile.twitter.com/BenHigginsSD/status/672197418474151936)
The "Chargers are moving to LA" posts are the front-page "scientists find cure for cancer" posts of /r/NFL
They are having the meeting on the 12 of January. A couple years I got a playoff lose to the Broncos for my birthday, next year I get to lose my team on my birthday. Classic Chargers. 
Don't give up, Charger fans. When my Sacramento Kings were going through the same thing a few seasons ago nobody gave us a shot at keeping the team in Sactown. Now the Kings are getting a new arena built.  Hopefully the same happens with you guys.
Prediction: Chargers and Rams move to Inglewood, Raiders go to Santa Clara, LA Chargers become biggest joke in the league, can't get a fanbase in LA, and move back to SD within a decade. 
Its funny how the NFL has used LA to leverage local governments into stadium proposals over the years, and now that there is a possibility of an LA team, someone is gonna be left holding their dick. 3 teams, 2 slots
Go Broncos.  
I hope it goes and the owners lose millions. I hope it's a complete disaster somehow.
It's.... it's just not fair. This whole process, it's just felt like it was the NFL and Chargers ownership who were basically just going to make up their minds on the issue regardless of circumstances. Like I get this is a business, and being an NFL owner means owning a business, but fuck. No compassion? None for the fans? The Spanos family shouldn't even own an NFL team, their networth is next to nothing minus the Chargers valuation, yet they're able to strongarm the league and give the finger to a city of fans who have loved this team for over 50 years. It just seems so cruel and without base, especially that statement by Gooddell. He knows the SD plan relies on a vote, which btw an independent NYC consulting firm today released a letter it sent to the NFL saying it would estimate a successful vote on the matter. Yet this is just that nail in the coffin that they didn't give a shit what the city of San Diego was going to pull together, they were going to decide what they wanted in a closed-door meeting of 32 rich owners without even the slightest caring of the fandom of the team or league.

It just breaks my heart.
Fuck Dean Spanos with a hot poker iron
I don't understand. In time for what? What happens now?
What a joke, there's a great football fanbase in SD whether it be the Chargers or the Aztecs.
Anyone know if it is possible to change your Reddit username? 
This season for the Chargers is like the '95 Browns.
This is bullshit. Fuck Goodell. Make a team from thin air and let's really get whacky. 
I wish the city would just create its own team and sell stock a la the Packers.
Fuck Dean Spanos.
[Here's something to cheer you up :(](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/19/49/35/194935f572da40f307a7678f9aae6126.jpg)   I'm sorry it's all I have but it always made me feel better seeing it last season on the banner.
what's funny is I'm not mad at the move to LA its an hour and a half away and I can still watch them on local TV. What I'm mad about is Spanos declining every deal SD has offered and Fibiani is an asshole. Fuck spanos, fuck Fibiani. Only reason I'll still root for the chargers is for rivers and gates, when they are gone so am I.
So... What happens with rivers? He said he didn't want to leave right? 
Just a little warning for non-Rams/Chargers/Raiders fans:

The NFL is coming for your team, too, sooner or later. They'll use a second spot in LA or, if that fills up, some other big city, to blackmail your town into paying hundreds of millions for a new stadium filled with luxury boxes. This is their MO and it won't stop in San Diego. 
Does it suck more to be a Browns fan or a Charger fan right now?
Gosh I'm so sorry Chargers fans :( . I can't imagine what you're going through. The owners/NFL are basically just ripping away a piece of your culture-your heritage, almost- for the sake of money. Can't imagine what it would feel like if Lurie did this with the Eagles. Maybe if you make a statement loud enough like Sacramento KingsFans did a while back there's a chance? Idk... I really hope you get your team- or a better one- back. 
Dear Goddell.

Move the Jets and Force Woody to sell the team.  

Love a Jet fan
Dean Spanos, Mexican translation for a whales vagina 
Felipe Rios is getting screwed
I need a fucking hug, drink, or both. Going to be super difficult breakup. What the hell am I supposed to do with my house full of Chargers gear? :( 
Man I'm bummed. I couldn't comprehend my team leaving, changing divisions maybe. But I could never see them leave. :(((
Fuck the NFL.
to KEEP the chargers?  You would think that it should be the other way around, you need time to present a viable plan to MOVE.

Unrelated, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is an ass.
damn.. that sucks. feel for you guys in san diego.
Went to my last Chiefs away game there this year. Good one to end on. Wasn't the writing on the wall for a decade? They never even upgraded that place. The video board is like a 55inch vizio. You guys will get another team. 
This perfectly illustrates the problem of private ownership of these clubs. If they really are civic assets like the NFL says they are (and I agree), then they should be publicly owned. Like the Packers. The model absolutely works, and its a shame that these fat-cat owners will never allow a situation like that to arise again. Meanwhile, assholes like Dean Spanos, Stan Kroenk, and Clay Bennett gleefully hold cities hostage and treat these teams like they are their playthings, while the fanbases have their emotions toyed with and their cities' pockets pilfered.  
Can San Diego sue to keep the team name like Cleveland did back in the day? (If that's even true )
[Worst. Day. Ever.](http://gif.mocksession.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/RIVERS-WORST-DAY-EVER.gif)
Bolt up Brochacho...."sniff". I feel your pain.
Always light your dumpster fire after you move guys. Always.
This is just plain shitty. I feel for you guys so hard.
Fuck, I'm really sorry Chargers. I can't fathom seeing the NFL leaving San Diego. I mean yes Los Angeles Deserves a team, but not at the expense of the Chargers relocating. 


I dont really consider Goodell a viable source. He has a legacy of dishonesty. 
Skol vikings
In other words: We decided on moving San Diego, this is the wording we chose to make it seem like it's the city's fault.
[deleted]
someone needs to do (or reference me towards) a ELI5 post about teams moving to LA and the reasoning behind them
I hate to sound unsympathetic to Charger fans in the San Diego region, but how do Charger fans outside the SoCal area feel about this?
Y'all better not fuck with my divisional rivals
At least I won't have to watch the NFL anymore when we move
This just sucks so much.  It makes me so sad. :(

Hang in there charger brothers!  I'm sure it isn't over yet.

I want to beat the chargers, but to quote the Matrix:   "Not like this.  Not like this."  :(
LA is Raider land

Can't wait for the all the NFL stuff gushing about the new franchise, team, stadium....all at the expense of loyal fans.
Fuck Dean Spanos.
Acee said ten percent...
 
Well too bad Acey aint in charge no more...
As much as I want a team here in L.A., I still feel bad for the city of San Diego. I've been to Charger games and the fans are awesome. Sucks for them...
Man, I wanted the Raiders and Rams to go back.
Fucking LA man...... Oh what's that LA? the Lakers weren't enough for you?  Nor the dodgers? You had the Raiders and the Rams, but you discarded them like the shitty fan base you are. Oh but now you want 3 fucking teams huh?  Yeah like you really deserve it.  

Easily the city I hate most in the United States solely because of the sports.  They will continue to use that shithole to force teams to build billion dollar stadiums off the tax payers dime.  

Fuck every team owner who threatens to move a team because they wont' get their precious stadiums built.  And FUCK ROGER GOODELL and EVERY GODDAMN TEAM OWNER.  I hope they all eat at a chipotle and get Ecoli H157:O7. 

If you can't start a single original sports team from scratch in your market, you don't deserve any. 
Really sorry  to hear it, Chargers fans
Serious question would you rather the Chargers move to LA or should they take the leap and head to London?
Go Panthers?
I don't want my division to change! I grew up with these teams together they should stay that way!

What a tough time to be a Chargers fan
Its heartbreaking to watch a fanbase lose their team.
I don't know much about this situation, but that's gotta suck for Charger fans. I can't imagine what it would feel like to see the Bears leave Chicago
Fuck you Spanos. Fuck you Goodell. 
... fuck you Goodell?
You know, San Diego, the only reason why Maryland's eminent domain seizure of the Colts didn't work was lack of time... And that meeting isn't until January...
Translation: San Diego won't make the extortion payment, so we're going to have to take a thumb. 
In other words, the move to LA was going to happen no matter what.
I feel for charger fans, the league and the Spanos family are basically holding the city hostage until they use tax payer money to buy them a brand new stadium when their old one's fine. It's like a kid throwing a tantrum until they get what they want. It's absolutely ridiculous. 
Welp. As long as i've been alive they've been the San Diego Chargers. When they move it's going to fuck with my head.

I feel so bad for Chargers fans. No one deserves to lose their team. On the bright side your not alone. You can mourn with ex Sonics and Thrashers fans.

EDIT: Fuck my bet ain't over yet

*Matthew Stafford is the GOAT of GOATS. He is so GOAT he has a pet goat. Named Matthew Stafford*
Fuck Spanos!
I know what it is like to lose a team and all of you laughing at SD i hope you remember to laugh when your team moves away
Man I'm so conflicted on this. As an LA resident I want a football team here. But I hate to tear it away from a good fanbase with a perfectly good stadium down in SD.

The Rams make more sense to me if a move has to be done. No offense to St. Louis fans, but the team absolutely needs a new stadium. 

Plus I'd rather have the Rams down here for selfish reasons. Guaranteed 49er game down here every year! 
Does anybody remember the San Diego Rockets or the San Diego Clippers?  After that turd Donald Sterling moved the Clips to La-La land, San Diego will *never* have an NBA franchise again.  If the Chargers move to the big LA, then SD will *never* have a pro football franchise again either...so sad
I generally feel like having LA fans concentrate around one team rather than spread out over many teams as they are now is going to be horrendous for this league. Imagine how smug LA fans are going to be?

Or better yet, imagine the "LA Chargers" are completely terrible which in turn causes the sure to be bandwagoning LA public to complete abandon them rendering them a financial disaster....

Hey you never know, the Chargers could be back home within 3 years.

Also, Goodell tried to do this to the Bills before Pegula shot down his dreams. Fuck that Clown. I'll never forgive him.

And I hope LA never gets a team.
There's something about this whole thing I don't get. They can't get a team to stay in LA. So why do they think this time will be different? I remember the stadium being half full most of the time when the Raiders were there, and towards the end of the Rams time there it was worse. So why the obsession with LA? I don't get it and I don't get the London obsession either, while I'm at it. Like the league isn't making enough money already? 
Wait, why are the Chargers moving tho? City wants em, owner has money why is the only option to move?
Truly sorry Chargers fans.
And here i thought "Nothing can be worse than being a Chargers and Ravens Fan this year". Tuche' Spanos
If the Chargers leave the division I'm throwing a bomb through Goodell's window. (pls no list NSA)
Players are going to miss playing in San Diego the most probably, always a nice day out for football there.  
Don't fucking drag us with you, San Diego.
Damn man. I feel for chargers fans. If my team moved away and I was left with no alternative but to root for the Redskins or Patriots or something, I'd probably quit watching the sport. 

It takes effort sometimes to realize all sportswatching is is living vicariously through the lives and exploits of rich corporations and selfish millionaires who play children's games. But I look past that because I love the sport and watching my team play it. If my team up and left...man I don't know, I think it would break the illusion for me. 
Does this mean by the time my daughter is old enough to wear her Chargers outfit (size 24months) the team won't even be there anymore? Well shit.   
  
Yes I know my flair is Seattle, but her dad is from SD. This just sucks. 
LA is a bunch of transplants with ties to other teams. If this hasn't worked in the past why is it supposed to work now?
Teams should not be allowed to relocate, period.
FUCK LA
I've watched Major League enough times to know where this is going.
Whoa holy shit.
Serious question here....for those who are chargers fans but don't live anywhere close to the team does this even matter?
Dean Spanos dragged his feet too long and is getting his wish is more like it
I know this affects how fans of the Chargers that live in SD, but out-of-state fans, will you still support them? 
What does this mean
I know guy working on the plans for the LA stadium, he said there are people in his firm working on one for SA. 
This has been a shit year in Ninerland, but I think losing a team like this might be worse. I still hate you Jed. 
Even I'm pretty sad to see the Charges move from San Diego, sorry to anyone that is from LA, but your city is pretty terrible.

[How I imagine Charges fans were reading that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CGKKhLr5LM) 
Total Bullshit. I feel horrible for SD.


Goddammit, I'm sorry Chargers fans
Can their plan just be, do what we've done for the last 20+ seasons? Can someone ELI5 please?
It's weird to me how this is being fast tracked.  I almost wonder if the League thought that no one would want to keep the Bills in Buffalo and that they were the inevitable team to leave and once Ralph passed away and T-Pegs came up with the cash they went with plan B. 
:,(

I'm so sorry
Soooo what does this mean? Sorry I'm out of the loop with this situation. Chargers are moving or cease existence?
Well mr rhydon_my_stelix looks like you just fucked me without using any lube. That's how your post feels anyways. 
Wow a whole fan base is just fucked?  
I'd say I was surprised, but Its impossible for me to be surprised that businessmen care more about dollars than they do anything else.
I know everyone says they'll stop being a Chargers fan with them going to LA. I think it'll hurt me especially with all the disrespectful actions the Spanoses have shown San Diego, but who else would I root for? I do know one thing, if they make a name change I AM done with the team.

I fucking love the Chargers man, I'm one of those dumbass fans who got a bolt tattooed and has given them my loyalty for 20 yrs. I think if I were to change teams the only one worth considering is the Browns. I'm a masochist at heart I guess. 
What does this mean for the Rams?
I'll believe it when I see it 
Sorry guys. That blows.
When will the LA team(s) start playing?
That is sad.
ITS HAPPENING
Come to the Packers. No chance for relocation and no real human billionaire owner to screw things up. 
[this whole season got me like](http://i.imgur.com/yTSCoeS.png)
[SHIIIIIIIIIEEET](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70eU840lc38)
Why doesn't the NFL just create one or two new franchises and locate them in LA? I'm sure this issue has been discussed at length, but I don't understand. 
At least they are staying in your own state and moving only two hours away. This would be a lot bigger deal for Rams fans 
Spanos and Kroenke are really trying to out-do one another lately.
 Fuck Spanos in his Fabiani sized asshole. I hope Felipe leaves them when they make it official and leaves these shit bag owners without a quarterback and a losing team in a city that hates losers and no fan base to turn to. Say what you want about the fair weather tendencies of the chargers fan base but as someone born and raised here I can truly say this city loves their team. Spanos could have been a hero in this city. 
If the owners really cared about the Chargers' fanbase and the NFL actually valued what they have in San Diego, then none of this would be happening. 

Like seriously, LA lost not one but TWO of their teams. There has to be a reason for this. I don't know much about the Chargers' fanbase but it seems to me that they have a pretty loyal group of supporters. That being said, I hope Goodell knows that LA and SD are not the same place. A lot of Chargers' fans aren't going to just keeping for the Chargers if they pack up and move to an entirely different city. I think the NFL is betting on the fact that many San Diego fans will stay fans because "all of SoCal is the same place". 
[deleted]
What's the problem, if San Diego loses the Chargers, they'll just hire some moving vans and steal someone else's team in the middle of the night. Isn't that how it works?
What happens in these situations? Chargers move to another city but do all the players remain or do the players become FAs
Could somebody explain what this means for us Ram's fans?
Viable as in the tax payers aren't willing to build them a new stadium.
Viable as in billionaires aren't being subsidized by government.

Fuck you Goodell, fuck you NFL.  

Fans that are loyal to teams should not get extorted because for some fucking reason one of the most wealthy businesses in the world, the NFL, can't find a way to pay for its own stadiums.

This is bullshit in any league, but it is really bullshit in the NFL, which is basically one big license to print money.
So glad our owner is local, wealthy outside of NFL, and committed to the Northwest. 

We went through this shit 20 years ago, almost lost the team.


I'm from England, so I live in a place where sport teams never move city. Maybe move across town for a bigger stadium etc, but you won't get Manchester United moving to and being called London United (well, in some completely stupid situations we got Wimbledon FC changed to MK Dons, but that's extremely rare). Why is it common practice to just move a team?!? Is it purely down to ticket sales? If that's the case, why not create more competitions , and give more things to win? Winning the FA cup is not as good as winning the league, but it's still winning something! Have relegated and promoted teams. Have cup games with teams outside the US.  Gives the fans something to get behind!

Or is it not based on the fans? Am I missing the point of moving teams?
Like they even gave them a fair chance at it. WTF 
Go Raiders!
blah blah blah.  stop talking and call me when something official happens.
Huge Chargers fan living in LA.  Really feel bad for the SD fans but I might be one of the few fans happy for this move.
So like for sure the chargers will no longer be in San Diego? I feel like there has so much speculation i don't know what to believe. I'm sorry SD fans but i think it would be cool for the Chargers to go back to LA. Am i an asshole for thinking that being a Bills fan? 
RIP in peace
For the past two/three years, the Chargers have been the fucking visitors during every home game. At this point, the support for the team is so poor. 

As someone who survived the Maloofs trying to move the Sac Kings a few times, I'm seeing a stark contrast in how the fanbases react to a potential move.
Heres hoping we get an MLS team then
I feel so bad for any team that's about to be taken away from them. As a Cubs fan I know this could have been us at any point in our life. Sorry Chargers. 
Good. I can't wait for them to leave. They Spanos family have never been good owners and they have been setting this move up since at least 2000. I'll be glad once it's final over.
So oakland, the rams and the chargers will be in LA?

So where do we say we want ONLY the powder blues in LA? No navy, powder blue, gold, and white. The way it should be.
Are we still getting the Rams? I was hoping for the Rams. I mean, I'll take both, but... Dem Rams would be the best option since it appears that after my entire memory bank is completely devoid of NFL fandom!
Phillip Rivers to Tennessee confirmed. 
Come to San Antonio!!!!
Have fun in London, Chargers. 
Forgive me, Chargers fans, but isn't LA like two hours from San Diego? I don't see why everyone is acting like it is the end of the world. That's like the Panthers moving to Columbia, SC. Is driving to the game on Sunday such an awful thing? Maybe it's because I've never lived closer than two hours to Charlotte, but that never has stopped me from seeing my team. 
I remember how relatively easy it was to get tickets to a Chargers/Jets playoff game in San Diego. I also remember Mark Sanchez raping the Chargers and the crowd clearing out about midway in the 3rd quarter.

I remember thinking "San Diego does not deserve an NFL team".

Today makes perfect sense to me.
I don't understand how the NFL doesn't see the value that a brand new team would create in LA. The windfall from doing such an action would be close to a billion dollars in 10 to 15 years.

Having exactly four teams in each division is cool. Is it really necessary though? KC could be shifted to the AFC South shit-show and the new LA team would compete with Denver, SD and Oakland.
I don't mean to be inconsiderate to chargers fans but I find it weird that everyone in this thread is getting so upset. They would be moving 2 hours away and would likely stay in the AFC West right? I live in L.A though and would love a team so I guess I'm biased.
It's pretty wild here living in SD as a transplant Bears fan. If the Bears decided to leave and go to another city within the state, an hour away like Rockford, I would still support them wholeheartedly. California's are just spoiled with multiple teams. I know many Chargers fans fed up and wanting this mess to end. Too bad really.
It blows my mind that someone would move their team to LA. How many teams have been successful for long periods of time in LA? Is San Diego not bringing enough money to keep the team in black? I don't understand how a team can work in LA now if it hasn't worked in the past. As far as I understand, the general LA fan has a difficult time staying interested in a team if they don't win.
Moving to San Bernardino?
So where would they go? Anyone know?

Oh and to all Chargers fans.

shhh bby is ok
[HA HA!](http://www.infinitelooper.com/?v=rX7wtNOkuHo&amp;p=n)
Definitely reminds me of 2002 Raiders:

37 y/o Rich Gannon - 4689 yards

40 y/o Jerry Rice - 1211 rec yards

30 y/o Charlie Garner - 962 rushing yards + 941 receiving yards

36 y/o Tim Brown - 930 rec yards

Especially with Gannon/Palmer venturing on "journeyman" status.

Tim Brown and Fitz have also had similar career paths, being on a single team that's struggled a lot and both having reached an SB.
That's actually really cool but you have to wonder how this Cardinals team will look in a year or two. Arians is a good coach though so I think they'll still be competitive. They seem like a team that is sort of in "win now" mode, at least for Palmer and Fitz.
Quarterback Carson Palmer is on pace for 4,772 passing yards, running back Chris Johnson is on pace for 1,352 rushing yards and receiver Larry Fitzgerald is on pace for 1,412 receiving yards.
And the first team to do so, win a Super Bowl, and ride off into the sunset together. 

*just let me have this*
Chris Johnson is easily the most surprising of this trio. I remember making fun of my friend when he picked him up early in the season in fantasy. After his benching in New York and getting shot in the arm this offseason, I don't think anyone thought there was anything left in his tank. 
Something about the Cardinals in /r/nfl??? I'm dreaming
&gt;Patrick Peterson 2015 in coverage: 43.2 completion percentage allowed, 1 TD allowed, 2 INTs, 34.5 passer rating

&gt;Richard Sherman 2015 in coverage: 57.6 completion percentage allowed, 2 TD allowed, 0 INTs, 110.5 passer rating

[:D](http://i.imgur.com/HTz8q4i.gifv)
I might be wrong,  but I think the Jaguars are on pace for the same record,  but with all players being under 24. /u/JaguarGator9 is this correct? 
Sun City.
[deleted]
The 2015 Cardinals are on their way to becoming the first team in NFL history with a QB-RB-WR trio all over the age of 30 amassing 4,000 pass yards, 1,000 rush yards, and 1,000 receiving yards while maintaining a bi-weekly meetup at the Olive Garden and consistently ordering bottomless breadsticks, having only twice ordered Double Decker Chocolate Brownies from the desert menu, while simultaneously maintaining above-average levels of eye contact with the cute brunette wearing glasses at the bar and only having been shut-down ONCE all season after trying to make casual conversation about Dikembe Matumbo's extraordinary height, in the process of successfully failing to get her number,  followed by a short walk to the liquor store where they averaged a fifth of bum wine purchase per week throughout the entire season, never once falling below 0.005 BAC, and walking home and  managing to get their keys in the door with a 78% efficiency rating just to lay in bed awake next to their adulterous wife who has been simultaneously managing 3 different lives with a median of 2 affairs affairs per life
That's amazing. Will they be able to keep it up into the post season? That's gotta wear on the body a lot more than when they were younger.
Not to steal the Cardinals thunder, but Jags are on their way to having a 4k passer, 2 1000 yd WRs, and a 1000 yard rusher all under the age 25. Probably not a first but I'm happy so I'm gonna brag about it
Also Long Snapper Mike Leach is 39.
Watch op jinx it
Cardinals more like Cardin*olds*
Hey I like this thread 
I'm absolutely loving these daily pro-cardinals posts. We are America's team. 
Ah yes, the Kurt Warner philosophy.
Legion of prune
These cherry picked stats are getting ridiculous.
That's an interesting stat.  
CJ1K
Don't take the over the hill gang from us...
Some of the stat records on this sub are so improvised that they fail to woo me.
And yet still lose their first playoff game
Old men thriving in Arizona? You don't say..
Well you just jinxed that
well arian't you fancy
What a time to be alive!
Makes sense why rookie Charles Woodson so good. Having to Guard Rice in practice must of sucked..lol
Go Cardinals
"The Arizona Grey Beards"
The All-NFL Senior Citizen team. 
Makes me think just how small our window for a Super Bowl may be.
They are a good fucking football team.

I hate super specific sports stats, because if you think about it, if we get specific enough we have all broken records in every sport we've ever played, like I'm probably the best offensive lineman that played for my high school in 2013 that was 5' 6" with a dog named Marty, but why the fuck does that matter..
I don't wanna be rude or anything, this is quite a huge accomplishment for any team, but it's also a cherry picked stat.
I hate multi qualifier "records"
Lighten up you pussies
The Spurs of the NFL.
......without winning the Super Bowl.
It wasn't just Johnson though. There was Peterson, Revis, Willis, Joe Thomas and Marshawn Lynch. Now I've made myself sad. 
Over Jamarcus? I thought Jamarcus went first and Calvin fell to the Lions. 
At least the lions aren't getting relocated.
They still have Calvin tho
Shitting on the Lions. I like it.
Raiders probably make up the 3 game deficit by end of the season.  This is insane. 
About the only worse feeling (until recently) was hearing "and the Los Angeles Clippers select" before your name.

I think guys like Calvin just think "well, I guess I'm gonna be rich instead of a champion" because those teams will never, ever let you go. Maybe you get lucky like Larry Fitzgerald and sniff success towards the end of your career when you catch lightning in a bottle and get a veteran QB who is pissed off. 

There's a reason the Lions draft early every year. Calvin isn't enough to solve that.
Lets swap, straight up.
Man, I thought "Shit on the Lions Week" was last week :(
It would have been crazy if Calvin were drafted over JaMarcus.

Thank god Al drafted JaMarcus ahead of Calvin.
At least the Lions have had playoff appearances. 
This has nothing to do with either of those two players.  All it's really telling of is that, as much crap as people give the Raiders for some poor draft picks with players that just haven't panned out well for the team such as JaMarcus,  Heyward-Bey, Rolando McClain, McFadden, etc., over that time period, the Lions have been even more mismanaged.  Mahew and Millen absolutely drove the Lions into the ground beyond belief over the past 15 years.
That's not that impressive considering how the Lions went 0-16 one year 
Despite the negativity, [this is greatest decision Jamarcus ever made] (http://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/jamarcusbling.bmp) 
Sucks to be the Lions.
Since '09 when they drafted Stafford. I think the Lions lead by 1 win. 41 - 40
Man do I love waking up to some shitty lions facts!
So we are posting meaningless facts that imply causation for no reason?  OK

Ever since the Sears Tower was renamed the Willis Tower, the Bears have never won a Super Bowl BUT **every** President has been a former Senator from Illinois.
What exactly does a single draft pick have to do with a team's win/loss record?
I know this is probably just a typo but it's driving me nuts.. they didn't draft Calvin OVER Jamarcus... it's meant to say JaMarcus over Calvin.
And yet, I *think* the Raiders would take Megatron if they could do it over again.
 The Lions could draft Superman, Captain America, and Batman, and they'd still find a way to lose. 
Is it "Shit on the Lions Day" in /r/NFL already?
Because wide receivers are overrated. 
The Lions continued inexplicable failure is one of the greatest sports stories of our time. 
This is a dumb statistic. The Lions were very competitive for a couple of years, with really shitty years sprinkled before and after. 

The Raiders have been an absolute dumpster fire up until just this year. And they're just okay this year. 
If you're trying to make an argument out of this, just know it will be illogical.
Stats like this and teams like the Patriots and Packers prove that WR is the most overrated position in the NFL.

It's all about your QB and getting to the other teams QB.

[Here is an old article I present in support of my point.](http://www.coldhardfootballfacts.com/content/gluttony-wide-receiver-feeding-frenzy/13955/)
Well yeah, one's a wide receiver and one's a quarterback. Also, the Lions have been to the playoffs, so I think they clearly won on a team accomplishment basis.
That's not really crazy at all. Did anyone think a single 1st round draft pick explains the arc of these two franchises?

Both teams have had some extremely talented players over the years. But neither one has been run to the standard of most other teams and that's why they both have crappy win totals.
Get it? The Lions are bad
Is JaMarcus still in the NFL? How is that relevant. one player has Hall of Fame locked and other player is out of the league and won't be remembered.
But would that be the case if jamarcus had been the qb all these years?
Imagine how many fewer games the Lions would have won if they drafted JaMarcus and not Calvin
A QB effects a team's performance more than a WR. I think this says more about Stafford than CJ.
Detroit VS Everybody
More proof that the impact of a great WR is wildly overrated.  
Well, I'd still like it if we drafted him over Jamarcus. 
[Maybe we'll fix our wrong again.](http://www.raidersbeat.com/?p=1467)
I...think I'm good with it.
I don't like that statement, it's rather clickbaitish.  The difference in games won between the two teams is not inherently reflective of the individual player.  On the other hand, which one had a larger impact to their respective teams?  My gut says that the Lions have seen a larger increase in games won since Calvin was drafted whereas the Raiders, save this season, have been abyssmal.  Johnson, by far, had a much larger impact on the Lions than Russell had in Oakland.
At least the Lions made it to the playoffs.
Well, most of their decisions have been JaMarcus over JaMarcus though.  One good decision in a sea of terrible decisions for both teams (until recently for the Raiders) will bring both teams about neck and neck, all else being equal.  
Well yeah, WRs don't typically win football games. 
Which is why people value wide receivers in drafts way too much.  Wide receivers do not win you games.  When you look at the last bunch of super bowl years, it's not like that many teams are inundated with top tier wideouts.  Last year was the Pats and Seahawks for instance.
I am sincerely shocked the Lions have more wins than the Raiders since that time.
This is stupid. Team sport. 

Take a good team with a bust of a draft pick and you can do the same comparison to a stud on a bad team.
I honestly can't think of a player who's career has been wasted like Megatrons. He's been on some bad teams and still put up monster numbers and been seen as the #1 receiver going around. On the right team he could of put up numbers that only Rice would of rivalled.

I like the Lions but they've just never managed to get that roll on and keep it. Sucks :(
I've been saying stuff like that forever. Skill positions aren't that valuable but then again... My team's problem right now is skill positions.
It's almost as if one good player can't carry an entire team 
I love Calvin Johnson. Nothing against the Lions but I hope he leaves Detroit before it's done to chase a ring. Dude is an amazing talent and so much fun to watch, I'd love to see him win a Super Bowl. Him and Fitz are both guys I'd love to see on top some day. 
lolions
Don't worry, he'll fix it in practice.
ONE MORE YEAR! ONE MORE YEAR! ONE MORE YEAR! ONE MORE YEAR!
I don't get how he is employed 
So do coaches have a "Dalton Line", and if so would that be a Fisher Line? 
How the fuck does Steve Owen have 17 career ties?
There is a lot of selection bias in this. I mean, Fisher still has a winning record overall. So when people wonder how he is still employed, the reason is that he probably still is one of the best 32 guys out there for the job and those who are worse than him are actually not able to stay employed long enough to accumulate 150 losses. Let a lot more coaches stay in the league for 20 seasons and a lot of them will have 150 losses. I mean, it's just a matter of time for Rex Ryan, for example.
Norv Turner with the second worst winning percentage on this list makes me cringe. Bad memories. 
George Halas was a much more impressive coach than I'd realized.

Edit:  So was John Madden.  .759 W/L% over 10 years!
Is this his [Ken Whisenhunt stat](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3phaq3/ken_whisenhunt_is_429_in_his_last_33_games_as_a/?ref=search_posts)?
Dan Reeves - 190 W 165 L

Tom Landry - 250 W 162 L

Don Shula - 328 W 156 L

Jeff Fisher - 166 W 154 L

On top of that, 2/3 of the people above him are in the HOF (not really sure why Dan Reeves ISN'T in the Hall), all three have won 2 Super Bowls, and each WENT to the Super Bowl 5-6 times.

Worth noting?

Tom Coughlin - 169 W 146 L

2 Super Bowl wins in 2 appearances.

*Pete Carroll is a stunning 89-66 well on his way to best HC record of all time.*
TIL George Halas has a better win % than Don Shula. Nice.
I actually have to give Fisher credit for managing to con his owners into letting him stay way past his welcome. It's really impressive. Don't hate the player...
For people who follow the Premier League, he seems kinda like Tony Pulis. He's not going to win a lot or make a team a contender, but he can make an average team out of a very bad one. 
Damn, Shula's record is impressive.  I'm surprised that he has a higher win % than Belichick.  I knew he was a good coach, but damn thats a good record.
How about Marty Shottenheimer with 200 wins and 126 losses? I know his playoff record is atrocious but man I love that guy.
I'm really loving the Jeff Fisher hate train recently. Great work /r/NFL.
Fisher is a dick tease. He wins just enough games to keep you interested but never goes all the way with you. But you stick with him because you heard stories about him going all the way with that one team a few years ago. 
As much as Fisher is the .500 king, remember how many coaches that makes him better than. And think about all the great college coaches who couldn't make it in the Pros, but Jeff Fisher could. 
Two interesting things really stick out for me:

1) All but three of the guys on that list have winning records. 

2) I had no idea Norm Van Brocklin was ever a head coach. All I ever knew about him was that he still holds the record for passing yards in a game. 
The worst part is there is still several Rams fans who will defend his mediocrity, say that he needs more time because he's not gotten a fair shake here, and then when you bring in how terrible he was for the Titans, they'll say he didn't get a fair shake there either.

It's just not his fault for 21 years of mediocrity.
Jeff Fisher has like four winning seasons in twenty years.
I don't understand how the media loves this guy. Average at best as a head coach.
He milked that Music City miracle and that punt against Seattle for how many millions?  
HES SO FUCKING BAD
So many former Redskins coaches on this list...
By far the most overrated coach in NFL history.  

Every one commends him, says he's a great coach, yet he's been the definition of mediocrity for over two decades now.  
Alright rest of the NFC West, we alone can make this happen (that means you too San Francisco). Let's give Fisher the record he deserves. Although AZ if you wanna go ahead and lose, I'm okay with that too.
Don't worry...I'm sure when San Francisco realizes they won three too many games this year, they'll fire their current head coach and hire Fisher.
He's going to get 11 and then retire.  Just when you have hope of achieving something.... anything.
I don't understand why a lot of people regard Fisher as a good coach. I don't think many people consider him to be a great coach like Belichick, but it seems like a lot of people consider him a good coach of the Andy Reid-level. 

The fact of the matter is that Fisher is mediocre at best. He's been a head coach in the NFL for 21 seasons and won 3 division titles in that time. His teams are good when they have a lot of talent and poor when they don't. That isn't the sign of a great coach, it's he sign of a coach who's along for the ride. Granted, he's been in a tough NFC West while he's been in St. Louis and he had to deal with Peyton Manning for more than a decade in Tennessee, but a great coach would find a way to sang some division titles or at least be consistently competitive under those circumstances. 

On top of that, Fisher is an arrogant asshole. 
I‚Äôd love to hear Titans/Rams fan opinions. I don‚Äôt know what level of input he has for drafting, but the Rams have slayed with the picks they got in the RGIII deal. Beyond that, my face value comment is he‚Äôs a former Super Bowl winner, decent coach that won the AFC with Tenn, but overall is overly focused on divisional games and doesn‚Äôt prep proportionally for games throughout the season.

He basically takes a dumpster fire and gets a decent to good season out of it imo. I think people forget how crappy our teams were when he was head coach. The few times he had talent (eddie george and mcnair era + cj2k) we did really well. But a lot of those titans teams I remember were garbage and we would always have a decent season.
George Halas, Don Shula, Paul Brown, and Bill Belichick have a 3+% lead over anyone else on that list.  

Belichick #1 all time in playoff wins, and he also has the best playoff win percentage (71%) outside of Weeb Ewbank, who coached only 5 playoff games. 
and you have to go all the way #12 before getting to a coach with a worse winning percentage...
But, hey, man, he's making an effort. 
Did anyone else try to click on a column header to sort, then remembered this is on imgur?
I miss Tom Landry.
Has Jeff Fisher just been living off his one Super Bowl run most of his career?
Fisher has been riding McNair's unbelievable run to the superbowl (loss in 2000) for 15 years. For a coach that's never done anything he certainly gets a lot of praise as a good coach.  
Fisher has been riding McNair's unbelievable run to the superbowl (loss in 2000) for 15 years. For a coach that's never done anything he certainly gets a lot of praise as a good coach.  
He needs to be shitcanned.  
The Chicago Bears pledge to help Mr. Fisher reach this milestone.
Imagine this. He didn't want to go to Miami.
Oh no, we suck again! - Rams Fan
After the remaining  5 games Fisher will never be a head coach in the NFL again. 
wow, they should name award after him for coaches that lose but have job security anyway. Marvin Lewis would've won it many years
I've never understood how Fisher keeps getting work. His teams lose so freaking consistently but somehow he escapes being fired...and when he does get fired, someone hires him immediately. Defies logic.
Fuck Jeff Fischer.

And Greg Willams.
The biggest thing to make me lose respect for Fisher are not the dirty allegations or his DC, but how when asked about the Case Keenum issue he tries to deflect all responsibility by saying he didn't see it. BULLSHIT! That statement is either a bold faced lie or admission of incompetence.

There are too many reasons for him to be fired.
The greatest trick Jeff Fisher ever pulled, was convincing the world he's a competent coach.
So a few other people have brought this up but I would like to point out something.

The "Jeff Fisher is a terrible coach circlejerk" is really just wrong...

Fishers record while at  Tennessee was 142-120, this included 6 playoff appearances and a Super Bowl which he lost by like 3 feet..

The Titans record since Fisher has left has been 25-46. So they have been a wreck since he left..

The Rams record before fisher got their ( the last 2 coaches they have had) was 12-48.. Fisher has been 20-27-1 since being hired.. 

Fisher has taken a team from dumpster fire to "almost .500 team"..

Jerk all you want /r/NFL but Fisher is a very good coach who is very good at turning teams around... 


Its almost as if he is a very average coach or something.
look at that W% Bellichick truly the goat
GO FOR IT
This is actually pretty interesting, because to be a head coach with a lot of losses, you typically need a long tenure.  Almost every coach on that list had an overall winning record.  Interesting to see Belichick, Reid, Coughlin and Norv Turner all there.
I am really surprised that Halas isn't higher on the list, he just coached for so long.
That's my coach! Woo.... -_-
This seems to indicate he's overrated
He also only has 12 more wins than losses. If he somehow manages to coach for a team next year and loses 12 straight, he will have a .500 record. That's probably not a very good record for someone that's coached for as long as Fisher has.
You damn well know hes gonna be around for a few more years
Coughlin is similar but he got his team rings. Funny enough, Reeves is pretty similar to Fishers record
When will teams realize Jeff Fisher fucking blows? 
I want him gone. I can barely even watch anymore. It was one thing to suck ass when we were rebuilding, but now we're just squandering good talent with garbage coaching. I swear if BB, Pete Carroll, or hell, even Chip Kelly was coaching, we'd have a realistic shot at playoffs.
God damn it's bizarre to see his name up there among those legendary coaches. One of these things is not like the others...
Made a career out of a SB appearance 
Cheers to breaking records, Rams' style!
Looks like Jeff Fisher is getting fired this year.
These threads always seem to come up just before the person gets fired...
Why did Dan Reeves stick around for so long, a little before my time and his name isn't familiar.
He is a man who has lived his career off of the greatness of Steve McNair, Eddie Geroge, Frank Wycheck and Jevon Kearse. If anything, his deficiencies probably held those Titans teams back.
People need to stop giving this moron jobs. Except, that I'll be sad when the Rams get a decent coach.
Man, I love talking shit on Fisher. It's been super fun this season. Hopefully he doesn't get fired so we can keep it up next year.
The real question is whether BB can ever reach the win totals Shula and Halas have.
I have this terrible feeling he'll be coaching the bills in 2-5 years
Someone has to hit the 200 loss mark.  
I wouldn't say he's a terrible coach, but he's definitely not great/good. He can put out a dumpster fire, he just can get you out of the dumpster. 
Can we get a sidebar counter?
The fisher line 
Holy shit Shula won a lot of games.
How the hell did some of those coaches have double digit ties?
FML
Crazy Belichick has never tied.
Yeah but Weeb Ewbank really must have sucked.
He lost his 8-8 magic with us, now he just totally sucks ass.
It's nice to know that the stats back up my perception of him as a coach.

I've never quite understood how he got away with essentially being an 8-8 coach on average. Three division titles in 20 (soon to be 21) years is not good.
I honestly believe he could turn his coaching career around if he'd just give up on offensive philosophy and just hire a competent OC instead of a yes man. Running up the middle then sideline passes at the line of scrimmage doesn't work in today's game.
What site is this from? Or is this home-grown stats?
Tom Coughlin's record isn't too much better, for perspective. 
Landry and Shula are there for sheer longevity. Shula is the winningest coach in NFL history and Landry is a legend for a reason.
If he can lose 12 in a row, he will be at exactly .500
The most amazing thing to me on this graph is that Belichick would have to average better than 11-5 over the next ten years to close in on Shula's career numbers
Guys, calm down. He just needs to work on his execution.
I can't believe this guy is the all time winningest coach of a professional football team.
Canton here we come? 
How the hell did Norv Turner coach that long and maintain that winning %!
Chuck Noll's numbers seems surprisingly pedestrian.
That George Halas guy was pretty good.
what happened to marty shottenheimer?

Good memories of Chuck Knox!
Wow he is bad.
This is the Age of Parity. Even the HoF caliber coaches like Coughlin and Shanahan are ~15 wins over .500. 

The only exception is Bill Belichick. It makes sense that there would be one outlier.
We all know where he'll [be going to celebrate] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTNwxaV61gs)
Marty Schottenheimer's line ought to raise some eyebrows too.  Not too many coaches have a win-loss percentage like that.   He even beat out ~~Shula~~ Landry.  But in the modern era.
That stash though! 
fuck you Norv Turner 
Is this one of those posts that get a hc fired?
HOLY SHIT this is SO impressive. How the heck does he still have a job hahah I've never seen any coach get more free passes than Jeff "next year" Fisher.. unreal
I'm rooting for him
The top 3 haven't won an average of 17 more playoff games than Fisher, they have an overall average of 17. They have won 12 more playoff games than him on average.
Slightly off topic, but damn, hats off to Belichick. He's in line to have a stadium named after him.
I don't get it. The dude's had many chances in many places. Does he have blackmail materials from an owners meeting or something? Why do they keep hiring him?
I doubt he lasts 12 more losses unless he sticks a whole bunch of wins Inbetween them
I notice Joe Gibbs isn't on this list. 
The Official Coach of the 06010

I'm so glad we got rid of him.  Can you imagine how bad it must be to only win between 6 and 8 games every single year?
Hypothetically speaking. If the Rams fire Fisher. And the Browns fire Pettine. Wouldn't Fisher be a steal for Cleveland?
Look at the bright side. We're 9 games away from beating Tom Landry.
so basically what youre saying, he's really not *that* good of a coach....
Dat Weeb Ewbank and his playoff win %tho
He blew it with Vince Young in Tennessee. (YEAH, I KNOW, VINCE YOUNG acted crazy...or whatever is said about him to make people sleep at night)
I've predicted he'd be fired the last 2 years. I'm not sure anyone in the Rams org is paying attention to anything but how cool it's going to be when they make it to LA.
I've always liked the guy and considered him a good coach. This kind of puts things into perspective though... Ouch
Guess we don't miss him here in Nashville so much after all
Ouch that hurts...
The new version 
I used to like Fisher... then he screwed VY. He deserves it.

Before anyone replies about VY's struggles I admit he was partially to blame but Fisher treated him like shit.
Right - because this is a list full of really bad coaches...
Whew whew!
[deleted]
When Jeff Fisher Le Trolled the Redskins like a sir last year, you guys said things like "That's kind of gangster" and "Troll all you want... when you rob someone like we did the Redskins they deserve to be reminded how stupid they were"

I'm glad you all hate this fucker now
How has this guy managed to stick in the NFL for this long? It makes no sense at all
Shula and Landry's records give some good insight. Both have tons of losses, but both are legends. Shows how much adversity a true legend really has to go through.
It never ceases to amaze me when teams rehire mediocre coaches. Lovie Smith, Ken Whisenhunt, Jim Caldwell, John Fox, Jack Del Rio, etc. If you sucked as a head coach once, you most likely will suck the next time. Unless your name is Belicheck. 
I'm going to use that Belichick stat to passive-aggressively talk shit to all of my Pats-fan friends.

"Did you know Belichick is number 17 on the list for coaches who have lost the most games? What a scrub."
Jeff Fisher is a fake tough loser who is more interested in fighting and field goals than winning football games. Only has that job due to experience moving. 
Damnit. I was hoping it kind of slipped their mind.
Not a single link to what the "Aug. 28 incident" was? I found [this story about an August 6 arrest](http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25262657/49ers-aldon-smith-arrested-charged-with-dui-hit-and-run-vandalism), I guess they got the date wrong?
You know that wasted talent thread?

Andre Johnson is not wasted talent

Calvin Johnson is not wasted talent

Barry Sanders is not wasted talent.

Aldon Smith is wasted talent
[1 calendar year suspension, starting today.](https://twitter.com/MikeGarafolo/status/666740323607941120)
Can't say I didn't see that one coming
http://i.imgur.com/6ww1N66.gif
I was wondering what this was about:

https://twitter.com/BairCSN/status/666736739734581248
So what incident was this?  
We released him on Aug 7th for an incident on Aug 6th...  

Can't say he didn't deserve it. He's kept his nose clean since joining Oakland. He's only 26...hopefully this pushes him to cut the bullshit over the next year and keep this up when he comes back. 
worrying about sheldon a little now....
Only took half a season
Rapoport:

&gt;The Raiders are going to stick with Aldon Smith through his suspension, I'm told. They were expecting this to come down.

Werder:

&gt;Raiders signed Aldon Smith to contract protecting team with weekly roster bonuses, incentives for sacks. Loses $323,529 per game
http://i.imgur.com/i3IfafU.gifv
I'm completely lost here. What got him suspended? 
Now that he doesn't have his day job Aldon can pursue his passion of testing the TSA in new and creative ways.
Why did they wait 9 games in the season?
And Hardy is still playing. Let that sink in for a moment. 
One year as in 16 games or one calendar year?
I thought the NFL forgot about it. Hope he does well when he returns with the raiders 
Aldon Smith? No way. That's surprising. He's always been an upstanding citizen. 
go back to 2014 and tell Raiders fans (I know not all) that they'd be defending Aldon Smith from too harsh a suspension. 
His season is Aldon
http://i.imgur.com/sgOPlOg.gif
I'm sorry, but its a joke that it took over half a season for this to get handed down
Gotta say, I have no sympathy for Aldon Smith after all the chances the 49ers organization gave him. I hope he gets help, but there's no reason he should be as confused or upset as he is reported as being.
Seems to be a lot of sympathy in here for someone who repeatedly drives drunk and actually hits other objects while doing it.  People somehow acting like he's being punished for weed only.  No, he has a nice resume.
How much do you all think the raiders defense will regress if at all?
Still got time to make things right, hope for the best for him, I love watching talented pass rushers
Does this mean he gets to play week 11 of next year? 
Without paying some lawyer millions to compile an investigation report? Madness I say!
49ers:

Hahahahahahahaha
People will look back at Aldon Smith as someone who could've been great.
I'm out of the loop. What did he do?
Its a bit of a joke to wait this long to suspend him. But yet again, what else can you expect from the NFL? 
Wow a full year, definitely making a bit of a statement. 
Odd timing but I guess it's for the best, thanks for the few good games Aldon.
How is this new? Why is anyone acting like this was not fully expected.
and greg hardy gets to still play, what a joke
Shocker
Well that explains the recent tweets I've seen.
Just when everything was going in order....
About time
Dayum
...forgot about that.
Can he appeal?
What did he even do again? And why would they said until 9 weeks into the season? Hasn't he played pretty well for Oakland?
I'm confused. It's a suspension following an incident he was involved in on Aug 28th. The Niners released him on Aug 7th. Did he get in trouble again? 
Good night sweet prince
[deleted]
Can we go back to Week 7 please? Things were much nicer then. 
He violated his parole if they found alcohol in his system. They won't get the DUI to stick. Whether he draws jail time may be up to which judge he draws.
So by that they mean four games since Goodell will somehow change the punishment.
Ahh yes the famous incident of August the 28th.
Look how much shit he got himself into during a 3 year period. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldon_Smith#Legal_issues
[My reaction] (http://i.imgur.com/vIf0lAD.gif)
If Goodell doesn't execute Hardy at midfield then this punishment is a complete joke.

So what happened to he didn't get charged and didn't do anything wrong legally. Can't imagine this doesnt get appealed and reduced.
This is a shame. Think of all the women out there he could have beaten up and continue to play in the NFL. He's really stupid that he didn't know that. 
Karma is a bitch as Aldon likes to say.
[Pobody's Nerfect.](https://bigtonysfantasyleague.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/aldon-smith-mugshot.jpg) - Aldon Smith

Seriously though, aldon needs to sit down for a while. A year may not be enough, 9 games wasn't. He's obviously not getting the message.
Seems harsh for hitting a parked car but I guess Goodell thinks that is worse than hitting a woman.
Fuck!!! Can't say I didn't see this coming but fuck a whole year sucks 
Oh shit I forgot about this.
No longer a rumor I don't think
In before the appeal.
Fuck
To the court room!
Man's a pillock so this isn't surprising, but it's unlike the NFL to take ages with these things is it... 
Assuming he appeals, as everyone appeals regardless, might drop it to what, 10 games if he's successful?
aaaw maaan :(

Thats a bad look for Raytown
I read this as one game and was totally outraged for a minute. He's a talented guy who's a total bonehead. Before this latest DUI I had very good reason to believe he had learned from his mistakes and was on the up and up. Hopefully he comes back still a pro bowler 
So is he suspended the rest of the year, this year and next year.... I can't seem to find out when it starts and ends
I wish him all the best and hope and pray this teaches him something.  I want to see him succeed.  For a while he was so dominant, I'd hate for this to be his story.
What incident?
What's Baldon Riff doing in the Impact Zone!?
&gt;"I am taking this time to work on myself and become the man I need to be, my team and organization needs me to be, and I know I can be," he said. "I had lost my love for the game and it led me to some poor choices, but I am thankful to the Raider organization for believing in me this season and will continue to better myself and grow from my experiences. I look forward to rejoining the team next year."

Aldon's comments.
Surprise, surprise 
Just fuck my shit up
Of course they let him play enough games to fold Ben's foot in half.
Surprised it took this long

I had completely forgotten about it
The Lawrence Phillips of his generation
That guy doesn't learn. In his case a year off will probably just do him more harm as he'll have more opportunities to F up again.
The boy just can't get write sir. Somethin' in his head
I'll take an appeal for $500 trebek
Distressing about sheldon a little now.
let's be clear all Raider fans knew this was coming Aldon knew RM knew Mr. Davis knew the team knew I just think a full calendar year is a tad excessive, does he deserve to get punished? of course but a whole year stings ..... I guess we weren't paying good defense anyway 
Im sure this has been said but my problem  is that hes also noy allowed in team facilities  or practice, which would probably be the best support system for him.  Truly the NFL does not care about the individual, but rather would like to set an example to deter the next guy. Just dont think thats right.
Why couldn't this have been sorted before his hit on Ben :(
:/
He's from the same hometown as me.  All I want is for him to come back home.  I think the Bay is bad news for him.

Go Blue Jays
Is this the one were he tried to board a airplane with a loaded gun or am I thinking of the wrong incident with this whack job?
I said it when this particular incident made news first.  I said it when his last one hit.  And I said it back when his first incident happened.  WHAT THE FUCK ALDON GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!
How you gonna get fired, on yo day off?
This dude needs some serious help.  I feel bad for him.
I am surprised there is no talk of an appeal to push the suspension later.  The Raiders are in the playoff hunt right now and every extra game they get out of him matters.
We kinda got out of situation freely, he forfeited his part of the franchise tag due to Balkee magical agreement. 

I am happy justice is done. He is one the reason why our team fell apart in the offseason. So many unwanted media attention.

Good riddance. 
Good
I hope the NFL doesn't bullshit with his appeal either. If Josh Gordon got a year for the shit he did smith needs minimum a year without a second thought. 15 games seems like it would be nice. 
The timing of this seems like a total F U to the raiders. I really like Aldon. Hopefully he can get his shit together and have a successful career.
Surprised he didn't get Silver'd
lol

this is my shocked face

:|
adios motherfucker :(
no ones gonna convince me that this is enough of a punishment for this person
Good riddance, bitch. 
^#JusticeForSmith
One year?  Dang.. should have just beat up a woman or something
Bout time. 
What a piece of shit. cut him! You should be ashamed of yourselves having him on the roster etc etc
Brady (allegedly) cheats his way to a Super Bowl: 4 games.

Ray Rice punches his fianc√© and knocks her unconscious: 2 games (before shit hit the fan)

Aldon Smith drives drunk: 1 YEAR. HOW DARE HE SULLY THE NAME OF THE LEAGUE.

I'm not saying he doesn't deserve to be punished for being dangerously stupid and irresponsible, but some consistency would be nice.
I was rooting for the guy, but ya done goofed.
He's such a fucking idiot.
how the fuck did it take this long? I kinda wish the niners would've just kept him since he got to play until week 10 wtf
Niceeeeee
What an idiot.

On the other hand, the NFL disciplinary system remains fucked. He could beat his woman with one hand and shoot up steroids with the other and probably be active week 17. 
How does this affect Wes Welker's value?
I guess he doesn't know the only thing you're allowed to do is beat women.
Is Aldon Smith still allowed to practice with the team? A year away from all football activity would be detrimental. 
This makes me feel better for some reason. We would have lost him anyway. 
Its about time...

But only one year?
Good. He deserved it. He has absolutely no reason whatsoever to be driving drunk. Hopefully he will learn and stop putting other people's lives at risk. If he can't change then he should never play another down in the NFL. 
can't they suspend a random 49er player and random Michigan player instead? 
All I have to say is.. **HA. HAHAHAHAHA. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA!!!!!!**

Stupid fuckin Raiders. We tried to tell you this was dumb. Let him be.

Do they have to pay him still?
This is bullshit.
Well it's not like he's been performing that well anyways
I hope Goodell get hit by a drunk driver on his way home
karma is a ________. #
I love when he does popular dances when he kicks a game winner. One year it was the terrio dance this year he did the hotline bling 
That story about Flacco's wife is actually hilarious. He must have felt so embarrassed  
must not be a lot of weird dudes in football
You can buy tickets to hear him sing next week at the cathedral as part of a catholic charity's Christmas concert.
Call me when he fights a paper tower dispenser or kicked out if the hall of fame game for being too drunk. I'll never forget you, Jeff Reed, you crazy fuck.
I love everything about Justin Tucker except for his uniform. 
What's up with ESPN videos not having subtitles?  How am I supposed to watch these at work without broadcasting to my coworkers that I'm dicking off.
Tucker is fun, but Vernon Davis is the weirdest guy in football.

Dude wears suits made out of [Godiva chocolate wrappers](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xzduy0bTr9Q/UP9oxxQxx4I/AAAAAAAAGXs/g7zsJ0FYywU/s1600/vernonblog1.jpg), one of many [fly](http://www1.pictures.zimbio.com/gi/Premiere+Tyler+Perry+Single+Moms+Club+Red+YsW01f_pPCyl.jpg) [ass](http://www.bows-n-ties.com/mens-fashion-tips/uploads/vernon-davisbow-tie.jpg) [suits](http://www.metroactive.com/features/images/12.19.12/Vernon-Davis.jpg), and [carries a chucky doll around and talks to it.](http://www.femalesandfastbreaks.com/uploads/2/9/2/9/29293963/1013911_orig.jpeg)

Sucks he's fallen off so much. he's one of my favorite players ever.

But anyways, Justin tucker is the best kicker in football and is a fucking awesome guy
He's our weirdo.
His George W is a Bill Clinton impression, right down to the thumb gesture.
Honestly, this is what Goodell and the NFL owners need to praise endlessly. Coverage of NFL goofballs, family men, fathers, the FUN side of life. Bounce the Greg Hardy's of the league out and then stop drafting them. Violence on the field, not off. I'll get downvoted because Hardy is a good ball player but I honestly don't give a shit. My greatest hero growing up was Reggie White, and yes, he was one of the best to play the game, but he also showed you could be a great guy and still be a great, violent, football player. 
Kickers are like goalies in hockey.  The weirdest (yet funniest) guys on the team.

Exhibit A:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEIEUr5RBNw
He seems fun to be around.
Only r/NFL can get so up in arms because of a silly video 
Fun fact: Justin Tucker tried to hit on my girlfriend when they were in freshmen music class together at UT (before we were dating). She shut him down quickly. Now he's on my fantasy football team.

I also went to high school with him and my mom complained about his mom once or twice but I never actually met the guy.
And they say kickers are people too...
Hi my name is Justin I'm so rand0m. U can call me teh penguin of d00m
Justin Tucker is the best kicker in football. Also the coolest dude. Jealous Baltimore has him. 
Martellus Bennett is weirder by far.

Tucker seems fairly normal from watching this.  Just extremely talented at a lot of different things.
Cool video. I hate espn's player. Won't work with RES or, you know, *Chrome*.
He's friends with the dudes in All Time Low too.
THAT'S MY KICKER
TIL I am just like Justin Tucker.

I suck at putting away my laundry, too.
Oh, there's also the ad where he did his McConaughey impression. It was alright alright alright.

http://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/article-1/The-Caw-Justin-Tucker-Does-Matthew-McConaughey-Commercial-Spoof/ca73b0b9-9348-49a2-86aa-d550913899a4
Justin Tucker is the only Raven I can never hate.
He's my new favorite guy. 
God Bless Justin Tucker. 
I love my kicker
this guy seems like an awesome dude
go away rick reilly 
He's basically a theatrical actor who also happens to be really good at kicking footballs
Justin Tucker is awesome, but Rick Reilly is such a weiner. I wish that anyone else had produced this segment.
This is fucking amazing..and the story about him accidently clunking a kick off of Flacco's wife's head had me in stitches. 
He's been my guy in fantasy for a few years now. Usually very reliable. I remember having him for that game he had 6 FGs. Major points. He also did the Terrio which was nice.
And of course this legit tweet when the nation was losing their minds about the starbucks cups, "Boycotting Starbucks for at least 9 hrs for not giving me enough whipped cream. They did have cool red cups and holiday music playing tho." Keep trolling tucker.
Seems like a fun guy but weirdest? No. That title belongs to [Ben Jones of the Texans](http://espn.go.com/blog/houston-texans/post/_/id/5220/once-ben-jones-handed-dreadlocks-to-aaron-murray)
I want to be friends with this dude.
He sounds like a walking headache 
Yeah, when did you become a nut bar? 
That was 'Alive' by Pearl Jam 25 seconds in. 
Hook em, Justin! ü§òüèª
That was a pretty good impression of Rust Cohle
from the title i expected more of a Harmon Tedesco type deal
I want to be his friend. 
It's funny how people complain about ESPN but they still hit top page on sports subreddits.
Hate the Ravens but now I can't hate Justin Tucker now.
Met him walking my dog once. around the west side. He is as nice and genuine as this video portrays him. 
If we're including front offices, Mark Davis has got to be up there as well with his '97 Dodge Caravan, 2003 Nokia, and his daily "sit at the bar at P.F. Changs" ritual.
Justin Tucker is the man. This video only makes me love him more. I also happen to be a massive Texas fan and will never forget that he sealed the game in the last Texas vs aTm game. 
Dude likes All Time Low, he's alright with me
He's probably the coolest guy in football. Everyone always obsessed with coming across as a tough guy. It's nice to see guys that don't take their personas seriously and just have fun with the spotlight.




I would love to hear him mic'd for a game singing opera as he hits a game winning FG.
ESPN's video player is dog shit
Played soccer with him in High School before the football coaches discovered him.  The soccer coaches always mis-took his outgoing nature for cockiness and insubordination, especially being a freshman on the Varsity team (he was absolutely filthy at soccer).

Glad the football coaches took notice of his ability to put the soccer ball ANYWHERE, his personality was immediately embraced.
Make sure you stay until the Ray Lewis impression. It's so worth it
In England if you asked someone to "shag your balls" it'd mean something very different and you certainly couldn't ask kids to do it. 
I'm sorry but Rick Reilly is unbearable.
Can we petition for Tucker to do the halftime show? I don't care if he does opera or metal it's better than fucking coldplay.
He is... the most interesting man in the world.
how about that dramatic fade out of his face for a good 4 seconds 
I have a soft spot for any Longhorns (I work at UT.. should probably do the dual flair thing on r/CFB one of these days), but I didn't know much about him off the field until seeing this. Awesome.
He might have just made it to my top 5 list of favorite players. Bonus that he is from Houston
I don't think I've ever seen "most awesome" spelled "weirdest" before. 
This is great
One mans weird dude is another mans insanely annoying bastard. 
Most special teamers are weird.
Longhorn legend 
My favorite player in the league.
Yeah, I think I could hang out with Justin.
What does shagging the football mean in American speak? Across the pond shagging means fucking I thought the video was going to take a very morbid turn when the discussion of kids shagging his balls came up.
New favorite player. 
"Here's the kicker on the Kicker......" Reilly must have been so smug about that one. 

Ive seen weirder especially after a couple hits to the head.
Tucker not coming out to kick the extra point last week, got me into my fantasy playoffs by .4 points. I love this man... or maybe the lack of this man.
I thought of Justin Gilbert which made so much sense at the time. This is good too, though.
I wish I could kick a football like that.
Keep Austin weird 
He seems like a funny dude! also, nice juggling with those mercurials on :)
Everyone knows Justin Tucker is awesome.
He's singing opera for a Catholic Charities benefit here next month. He's a real renaissance man.
I fucking love Justin Tucker. And all kickers for that matter.
1/10 on the Ray Lewis impression.  Didn't say anything about god.
Holy crap I'm so glad I watched this. I've never seen someone who is more like me personality-wise. All the impressions and singing drive my girlfriend insane. Pretty sure me and Tuck would kill each other out of sheer annoyance if put in the same room for too long. 
You mean the coolest dude in football.
Seems like a fun dude to hang out with to me.
Should stick to Opera. Those were some bad impressions (Ray was pretty good actually)
Dude seems way legit
Commenting so I can come back and watch this.
Rick Reilly... there's no way I'm watching this. 
My vote is the long dnapper who does magic, seems really interesting
TIL I have a bit of a man crush on Justin Tucker
"One of the best kickers in NFL history." Has been playing for four years. Cool it there, Ricky.
the dude is awesome
If I had to choose any other kicker besides Ghost it'd be Tuck for sure.
Yikes, this is weird?
Could you imagine him and Pat McAfee having a podcast? Omg.
Lol at him singing the Toreador song though. THOSE AREN'T WORDS.
Thats a guy living the dream right there, good for him. 
I really like this video. Thanks for sharing, OP!

There is/was a Texans player who plays Pokemon who battled with one of my favorite Poketubers, Haydunn. I was so blown away that 1) an NFL player loves Pokemon to that extent, and 2) he'd battle one of my favorite battlers. I really want to see more of these pieces on athletes; really helps us see them as people rather than entertainment pieces.

Quick edit for those interested: [Brendan Williams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2VPoKiqi0s)
How old is he? 
He's on a one year contract. 2.3 million, and he's been automatic this year as always. Dude is gonna cash in next year as he should.
I've never heard of this guy but he's got a new fan.
\m/
I met justin tucker out at a bar one night last year. Him and a few other ravens had a table next to us. Super super cool dude took time out to talk to me and some friends. I told him I was thinking about naming my unborn son tucker(my wife who was with me was 6 months pregnant at the time) His response.. "not after me right?? I'm terrible under pressure!, Tweet me a picture when hes born!" He seemed like a really nice guy.
He needs a vlog
Justin Tucker...Mr. 27-25
He's hands down my favourite kicker in the NFL
Kickers always have the best personalities! 


My favorite Raven. &lt;3
Honestly, he seems like a rather intelligent guy who enjoys who he is. I'm sure OP is envious of Tucker's ability to speak 7 languages, sing greatly, and kick accurately. 
How did Jared Allen lose his title?
This is such a dumb puff piece.

Apparently "weird dude" = every average bro in America.
I mean...I am conflicted. On the one hand, I don't have "sploosh" parts.

On the other hand...sploosh.
Would have loved to watch this but Rick Riley makes my skin crawl....Couldn't get past 10 seconds
To all those saying he's a douche: get over yourself.
I can't be the only person who thinks this guy seems really annoying right?
Eh, Greg Hardy is still the weirdest guy in the NFL to me.
Wait? Is this odd, childish behavior endearing to r/NFL?
Damn, his old lady is sweeeeeeeeeet....Wow:)
Dat wife tho.
Dodge Ram Charger stadium had potential 
I hope the stadium is shaped like the Millenium Falcon. 
Would they play at Disney Stadium, where dreams come true?
Oh, now the park hopper passes at Disneyland will include a football game!

Only $1,500 a ticket for Socal residents, what value!
I need a Raiders logo with Mickey Mouse ears, please.
I can't be the only guy believing putting the Chargers and Raiders in the same stadium is a realllyyyy bad idea..
If this means breaking up the division I will riot. Broncos, Raiders, Chiefs and Chargers are not to be separated   
This is a huge game changer.  One of the criticisms of the Raiders move was that Mark didn't have the background to manage a move to the second largest market in the US and that Kroenke and all his money did.  This directly addresses that while getting a big name under the NFL fold.

If I was Kroenke Ild be sweating right now...and if I was a StL fan I'd be pretty happy.  Remember, even though rumblings out of the NFL office is that there isnt enough public money involved, StL is the only city with a real stadium plan ready to roll in the short term.
Fuck everything about this year of football. 
This is the darkest timeline.
This is 100% Bob Iger as an individual. Disney is not funding the stadium, naming the stadium, or doing anything with the stadium. 
Important to note this announcement is happening on the day our mayor is speaking with the NFL pleading SD's case. This isn't the first time the Chargers have undercut the mayor. Every single time he's had a major announcement or meeting planned, the Chargers released a statement to the press about their progress in LA -- on the SAME DAY. Fucking scumbags. Idk how the NFL can possibly view this as a "good faith effort" to stay in their home market. Anyone with half a brain can see the Chargers are gunning for LA.
Disney, get out of our division! You're ruining it.
I don't wanna do it. You can't make me.
Note to self: never go to Disneyland again.....or watch ESPN
As an East Bay raised current OC resident with a Disney annual pass I'm kind of ok with this. 
THIS IS THE WORST FUCKING SEASON EVER. ALL MY NIGHTMARES ARE COMING TRUE!
If the Rams and Chargers swap divisions, the AFC west will be the only division where all teams have a ring. 
serious question: is this a conflict of interest due to disney owning espn and their relationship with the league?
ESPNFL
2015: Number of NFL teams in LA = 0
2016: Number of NFL teams in LA = 19
Honestly, I don't care anymore. The Spanos' are going to own the team no matter what and continue the cycle of a ceiling of continuous mediocrity. I just wish that Rivers, Gates, Scifres, and any other old timers that I'm forgetting could have landed in better situations. The NFL's stance on so many positions such as Breast Cancer Awareness, Military Appreciation, Domestic Violence, celebrations, the salary cap situation with the Cowboys and Redskins a few years back, and the general blatant money grabs by the owners has made me so disillusioned. I'd rather watch college football at this point, sure the quality of the players aren't as good, but their is much more tradition and teams represent more than a general geographic area but a university's mission of empowering others.  
LA tusken raiders
[I'm not going to let myself get my hopes up.](http://cdn.yourepeat.com/media/gif/000/124/541/2e3cd2fb027c9cc0ae922eee2de58b44.gif)

In Peacock we trust
sigh....
Important to note in that- Iger could purchase the Raiders by 2018.

EDIT: [This is the tweet. He could become a minority owner at that time.](https://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/status/664441110232723456)
The only entity in the US besides Oprah that is more powerful than the NFL... Disney. Yeah this stadium probably gets done.
So, Raiders and Chargers to LA, Rams stay put or go to London.

It's believed the NFL won't want two AFC teams in the same city, let alone two in the same division. Raiders have already said they'd switch if asked.

So, Raiders to the NFC West, you bring Seattle back to the AFC where they started, AFC West.

And after all of this people in Los Angeles will still not really care all that much about football, which is why the Rams and Raiders left in the first place.

What a time to be alive.
ITT: Misinformation and over reactions 
If they win the Super Bowl when asked where they are going next they can say, "I'm going back to my stupid stadium, Disney"
Welcome back, Tusken Raiders!
I hope they buy the naming rights and call it Hakuna Matata Stadium
i dont like espn and 2 teams having shared ownership personally
And the stadium will be crowned... The House of Mouse!
Darth Vader and the Raiders will now be a licensed reality. Brought to you by Disney.
I wish there was some way to make it obvious why a thread that was marked misleading was marked that way. Now I just have to sift through all the comments to find an explanation. 
What is misleading about this? It seems very accurate to other things that I have read.
Can't LA just get an expansion team?  I don't want to see any of these markets get screwed, even if this is good news for Rams fans.
Would that mean LA wouldn't have to put out any taxpayer money for the stadium, just the infrastructure costs? 
NO DISNEY STOP PLEASE
Los Angeles Oakland Raiders of Anaheim confirmed.
Ah, goodie! The more money our fat fucking loser of an owner pumps into this failure of a project, the more inclined he'll be to sell the team when Kroenke is rubbing his balls against the grass of his shitty LA field. 
Which team change a conferences? Or would they seriously try to have them play in the same division?
The "mystery investor". Jason Cole was right for once guys.
Is it possible for all three teams to relocate to LA?
[MRW](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw2sex1mJNI)
JUST
This is the exact opposite of being the happiest place on Earth.
Fuck.
This will be a killer finding dory tie in
Conspiracy confirmed: Disney has planned this since the beginning.
:[
Just when you thought the $1 billion location change fee was going to end the LA move, Disney comes back and totally revives the move again!
When I think capitalist profiteering scum, Disney is one of the first corps that comes to mind. On a lighter note, to where will the NFL threaten relocation for teams that won't build a new stadium if LA is occupied?
They should've gotten Ari Gold to do it
"Hey, do we know anyone in LA who can clean up our team's perception problem while helping us get a stadium?"

"That's not going to happen, Mark. You'd need the CEO of *Disney* to join us if you wanted us to get over our rep."

"Then make it so."

"Mark, I was just being sarcas--"

"I SAID MAKE IT SO."
Worst... Disney... Movie... Ever... :I
The Mighty Ducks are making their way to Football 
If I were an Oakland fan, I'd be pissed.
Darth raider, the official mascot. 
E

S

P

N
So I guess it's going to be the LA Raiders of Anaheim and the Anaheim Chargers of LA. 
LA has had how many teams? 3?  



If Disney pulls this stadium bullshit off they should rename the teams, the LA Force (Chargers) and the LA Darkside (Raiders)
I hope one of these teams can win a superbowl soon so they can they are "going to disneyland"
In before teams change to various disney mascots.

Fuck
if he brings the corn dogs from the corn dog truck in Disneyland...0_0


Lol at the article comments

&gt;Kroenke looks like a bad porn actor
Spending that Star Wars money a little early are we?
ESPN, Star Wars, Marvel, Muppets, ABC, and now the NFL.

Next, THE WORLD!
Disney is not going to own the stadium.

Disney's CEO is the chairman of the bid committee going before the NFL BoD to pitch the Raiders/Chargers project as the best one. 
No love for the Rams?
Spanos looks constipated in that photo
Please no raiders
Don't believe this is happening. 

Oh well, there's always the Padres.
Damn
The happiest place on earth...
Raiders or Chargers to the NFC West, Rams to the AFC West?

As a Hawks fan, I don't want to go back. We've built rivalries here in the NFC West.
Interesting location 
I wonder if they will have "A whole new world" playing when you walk into the stadium? 

I bet they end up doing magic carpet rides for the halftime show. 
Is the Raiders or the Rams that want to move to LA? All three?
Never understood why a stadium share among division rivals is "wrong" if anything it's more fun for the fans because its an extra "home game" they can go to. 
&gt; but Igor is expected to drive the overall vision for the stadium project for the Chargers and Raiders

Classic typo
Son of bitch!
Please no. LA needs the rams. 
Fuck Disney...GoD Damn it, this some Mickey mouse bullshit
[deleted]
How the hell are they going to have two divisional teams in the same stadium?
TIL that Stan Kroenke owns Arsenal in addition to the St. Louis Rams. I knew the Glazers owned Manchester United and the Tampa Bay Buccanneers, but did not know this about Kroenke. I'm sure that's not the biggest takeaway from this but it was for me ... 
Disney's new L.A. Raiders of The Lost Ark Stadium
I feel like ESPN might have a little bit of a presence at this stadium. 
omg yes.   the spanoses having to suck disney dick is spectacular.
Please let this happen, gives us a whole new angle for shit talking.
I think we need to unite with Raiders fans for a one night arson project.
nnnnhello friends jim nantz here inside the LA Disney Epcot 2 Dome Deathstar getting set for the battle of the baja between the Tusken Raiders and the Chargers.
They are going to change everything.  The Autumn wind song.  The uniforms.  Just to be more disney friendly. 
?

I thought Ari Gold was handling this
Just move the Rams there. 
Could it be that these teams physically play in LA but still identify as their respective CA city? 

EDIT: honest question.. 
FUCK this. FUCK Disney. 
it would make so much more sense for it to be the rams and one of those teams
Does this not mean that Disney &gt; ESPN would be a stakeholder in some way of at least 1 NFL team? Is that allowed?
Am I the only one worried about the potential ESPN bias that could ensue from this stadium? 
I have never understood Oakland as a NFL market anyway.  Its not that huge a town and there is another market 10 freaking miles away.  
Is there anyone out there, aside from the NFL owners, that actually wants a team (or two) in LA?
As a San Diegan, I have mixed feelings about the Chargers wanting to leave. Some of us here say fine, be gone but at the same time who would come to San Diego? St. Louis or perhaps Jacksonville? 
So ESPN is going to own a stadium? Ummmm.....
So, in true Disney fashion, the stadium will need to be called "Land" or "World". Given the history of LA football teams, might I suggest "SoManyUnsoldTicketsLand" or "NobodyShowsUpWorld".


Disney if you're reading this, DON'T FUCKING DO IT. People in LA don't give a fuck about either team. Please bring us a team that hasn't been run out of town in the past
Playing in the Chargers arena always was like a home game anyway. 
Holy fuck Disney, you have Marvel, Star Wars and now my team. 

Can you imagine how happy Rivers kids are? 
Does that mean both the Raiders and Chargers are officially moving to LA?
So now the network that is number one in sports coverage decides where teams are located. I love vertical integration!
Goddamn Mark Davis is so goofy looking. If he just had a proper haircut instead of just putting a bowl on his head and cutting around the edges he'd look so much more normal...

Oh yea, and fuck this whole stadium idea. Raiders and Chargers can't share a stadium!
Please not on the Westside, we have enough congestion.
Tomorrow:  Stan Kroenke purchases stadium site in London.
You mean to tell me [this man](http://cbssports.com/images/blogs/Carson_Councilman_Albert_Robles_Chargers_Raiders_Jersey_Picture_Ugh.png) wasn't a good face for Carson?!?!
I dont think disney would like it if bob igar is whoring himself out like this unless it were to work, i think this is the final nail on the coffin for me to believe. 

Even if Disney itself isnt involved, they dont want their name to be associated with the rotine bullshit that is involved with using LA as a threat.

Also Disney isnt a stranger with being involved  with sports teams, like the ducks or the angels.
I was hoping LA wouldn't have two teams and share a stadium, at least with NY both teams have been around forever 
lol at the caption about dean spanos being "well respected by owners". for what? inheriting a team and having it be a shit show?
At least there wont be anymore crazy fans at raiders games, right?
I just imagine the Disney castle being part of the design. And the Raiders would play there. Amazing.
Banking on visiting team fans to stop by Disney before Sunday. Hmmm...
How many LA teams are there going to be? 
Haven't LA Raiders fans proven to be bandwagoners? One of the main reasons why the Raiders left. Through the bad seasons Oakland Raiders fans have proven to still be there buying overpriced tickets. Bad move imo. 
&gt;Disney has announced that the Chargers mascot will henceforth be the loveable little pooch, Bolt, from the hit movie of the same name.
OH MY FUCKING GOD WHAT IF THIS HAPPENS AND THEN DISNEY BUYS THE NFL!
Why does this have "misleading" attached without any other source?
Raiders and Chargers to be renamed the LA Gooftroop and Mousekateers respectivley
[deleted]
Back off you Disney piece of $H!T... Raiders aren't going anywhere 
As an LA resident, this would be horrible. I hate having the city split already between Lakers and Clippers. I don't care who comes, I just want ONE team. 
I don't even care anymore.  This just epitomizes our hate for L.A.,  it's all surface abd facade just like our team and our owner. .. a joke.
So, Disney owns ESPN, broadcasting NFL games, selling advertising and making revenues from NFL's success, while providing "journalism" of NFL. Now, they are going to be a landlord to two NFL teams. This is so weird.
Can someone answer me on why the people of LA would want another established team from another city?

Why aren't they trying to get a new team out there?
No fuck you! go fuck with someone else dammit! Leave San Diego alone!!!
I can see it now. A Mickey Mouse statue outside the stadium wearing a Chargers/Raiders uniform. The Mickey Mouse &amp; Friends Halftime Show. Advertisements for Disney Channel/Disney XD/ESPN/ABC/ABC Family shows throughout the concourses. ESPN networks playing 24/7 on every TV in the stadium.

Let's call it: "Disney Field at Carson Stadium".
No Rams? 
They will never get enough votes to get this going. A stadium 5 years down the line? This is not happening
This is ridiculous. Congress needs to step in and stop them. Teams should not move. Period.
This is a really fucking dumb idea. Sharing a stadium is bad enough. Sharing between long time rivals is retarded. It works (ish) in MetLife because the teams have no real history with each other. It would be like the Jet sharing with the Bills. The salt makes the Dead Sea sweet 
Raiders and chargers? They of course realize only one team can be LA...
Disney owns ESPN. Just piles on more how ESPN is in bed with the NFL. 

Edit: Is the ESPN brigade out? Do people really think that ESPN will cover any move to LA fairly? 
I still think the huge elephant in the room for the Carson stadium is the fact the divisions would need to be realigned. It's funny that no one ever mentions that. 
Let's see where they're at in a few weeks...Cleveland was leading the AFC North around this time last year. The division sent three teams to playoffs, and guess which one missed out...
This is a great year for the Wildcard race - probably won't be decided before the last week of the season.

Despite them being in the AFC South, I never had that much hate for the Jags. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing them make the play-offs for a change. 
Our next 6 games are SD, TEN, IND, ATL, NO and HOU

That's very doable.

EDIT: San Diego is in shambles right now. Tennessee may be the worst team in football (although we always split between them for some reason). If Indianapolis has Hasselbeck, we can beat them (we nearly did the last time, and this time, the game's in Jacksonville). Atlanta has lost four straight and is reeling. New Orleans is below .500, and we always play close against Houston.

If we can go 4-2 in the next 6, I'll take 8-8, regardless of whether or not we make the playoffs. I would've taken 8-8 at the start of the season for sure.
My Bortles are fully-raised and ready for action.
And we get San Diego this week 
We're in the thick of the playoff hunt! And with the remaining schedule, we have as good a chance as I could have hoped for. Let's go Jags!
This Bucs-Jags Super Bowl is coming along nicely.
I would love it if 3/4 cat teams win their division. Please Jagbros make this happen.
They have lost to the Colts already, unless their win is against the Colts they are essentially 1.5 games out of first right?
[According to Football Outsiders they have the easiest remaining schedule in the NFL](http://www.footballoutsiders.com/dvoa-ratings/2015/week-10-dvoa-ratings)
It's still early, but... *fist bumps Floridabros*
Way to go Jagbros! Glad to see the rebuild finally on the up and up
I'll start to get excited if we beat San Diego. 
I want the Jaguars to win the super bowl, but for purely selfish reasons.

If the Jags *squeak* into the playoffs by a game or less, then go onto win the superbowl (or hell just eliminate the Pats) simply because the refs missed the false start at the end of the game a week ago, then the possible media shitstorm could be so good, and maybe could force the nfl to do something about these shitty refs deciding games.
They're in this spot every year, the only thing new is that it's week 12 instead of week 2...
If the AFC South sent even one team to the playffs at .650 or worse record I would not even be mad.

Unless it was the Titans. 
This just shows how much everyone over-reacts every week.
I would love to see the Jags make the wildcard. Partially because I have a soft spot for the Jags, but mainly because I want to see other teams go crazy when the Jags make it over them when they should really have one less win.

Maybe, taken together with all the other ref garbage that's been going on this season and some angry owners, Goddell will decide to make refs a priority (or at least take a look at challenge-able penalties).
I think if they can just get their defense together a little bit, they might be able to make some noise. 
WATTBA
Imagine if they actually had their first round pick!
I've said it before and I'll say it again: they're going to go 10-6, win a great Wild Card game at home and then lose in New England the next week.
#bortlesnation
Go shitty Florida teams!!!
Were coming mother fuckers! 
[Obligatory comment here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMRrNY0pxfM)
That's not quite true since they've lost to the Colts and the Texans already. If the Jags win next week and the Colts and Texans both lose, the Jags still aren't in the lead for the division or the wildcard over either the Colts or Texans. They would need to beat the Colts and/or Texans to even out the H2H tie-breaker and then it goes to divisional record which the Jags are behind both as well. 
AFC Wild Card race will be insane.

Im seeing multiple teams at 9-7 and 8-8 and it will all come down to tie breakers.  I don't see Pitt winning 4 of the last six, or any of the 5-5 teams winning 5 of the last six.
Loving the unpredictability of the season! It has been quite a strange season so far. I don't think anything is confirmed yet. Lots of football left.
This is going to be a wild playoff race
I like to sit down and "scout" the big prospects year in and year out and Blake Bortles was by far the most frustrating QB I think I ever tried to evaluate.  He had some throws where I said, "This guy reminds me of Roethlisberger".  Then he would have some where I just thought, "How in the hell is this guy getting a 1st round grade?!"

Regardless, the dude is a leader on the field and he's gonna take Jacksonville places.  If they can get a bit more consistent on defense and in the running game, they could win the AFC South imo.
#JAGGINOFF
They only won one of their games because of a missed call. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the jags at all, most of my hate is for the colts, but if the jags beat the Colts and Texans for the AFCS then I'm probably gonna cry
As a fan of complete and utter dog shit for nearly a decade I'm glad to see one of our fellow bottom tier residents starting to make it big, make us proud Jacksonville!
They have the ability to finish strong this season and set themselves up for an amazing year next year. I do not think they will go too far this year but after a few moves on the lines, they are poised to be a playoff contender.
As a Ravens ran with a lost season, is as long as the Steelers don't make it I will be satisfied.
Boys get your sniff-gifs ready!
Yeah them and like 7 other afc teams are one game out of the wild card
They'll be back in when they beat my beat-up Chargers this sunday.
Woooo time to root for the bucs and jags
I love this part of the season.
This means nothing really. Such a long way to go. Yeah it sounds great now, but that's like saying you're leading the first 40 meters in a 200m sprint against Usain Bolt. I love my Jags but our wins have been by the the slimmest/strangest of margins and accidents.
I believe! Raise your Bortles!
Can anyone give me a quick run down of how bortles has been playing, I watched him last year due to his rookie play but haven't seen or been paying attention to to many jags games this year.
that could have been us :(
Just when I finished masturbating, you post this.
go jags
They're going to win this week, trust me.
How crazy-awesome crazy would it be if Houston, Jacksonville and Indy all made the playoffs.
Weird.
I'd prefer it be us, but as long as it's not the Colts :)
I mean that's how that kinda works. Win the division, get a playoff spot
The super competitive AFC south!
all I can say is ‡≤†‡≤ø_‡≤†
They're 1.5 games out.
"Not only are the Jags* 1 game away from the 4 seed, they are one game away from the 6 seed!"

That's not that interesting  
What a time to be alive, the Jaguars are now relevant!
I'm all about the Jags circle jerk, but I'm not going to be convinced until they beat a decent opponent. Their best win is over Buffalo, where they nearly blew a 27 point lead lol.
The dream
Wait... the Jaguars are potentially a playoff team? When the fuck did this happen
what a shit year for the NFL this year. 
London must be psyched. 
# DUVAAALLL!1!
hahahaha - chiefs
If only all of our teams could play in the mighty AFC South
That guy looks pretty jacked for a WR.

"Hey, man. We are willing to give you a shot!" - Titans exec

"Oh. Oh, man. Nah. I'm good." - JA
Props to this guy for not just making a twitter post like everyone else.
We'll take him. Titans have 2 WRs and 26 TEs. 
I have a men's rec league basketball team that desperately needs a 6th man.  we have no bench and every other team has at least 3.
Meanwhile the Texans are also standing out there for a chance at football.
Rex Ryan will sign him and then hold a press conference about it.
Is he taller than 5'8"? We could use someone taller than 5'8".

Edit: YOU'RE ALL WRONG. He's 185.42 cm tall.
Well, Joe Anderson's Agent fucking sucks
That takes balls. I'd give him a tryout. At least you got someone who you know really wants it.
I admire the hell out of the guy. I hate that there are hashtags handwritten on the sign.
does food count against the salary cap?
He'd probably be a WR 2 on the Browns. #sigh
This guy is so popular that my chrome extensions thinks the article is talking about a soccer player.
Someone give this man a try out
Baltimore needs a good wide receiver, but in keeping with tradition perhaps we can just take another guy with a lot of potential.
From his wiki page

&gt;&gt;After being activated to the active roster, Anderson stated that he will be active against the Green Bay Packers. Anderson was mainly used on special teams, and against the Packers, Anderson nearly blocked a punt, **and body-slammed Randall Cobb on a kickoff**, though the Bears still lost 21-13.

/r/chibears, which one of you wrote that? 
That's great and all, but he should probably go to a lesser league and try to shine there to get publicity.... Standing there most likely won't do anything.  
I'm going to be the dick here, and say he should at least try the CFL or something
Can he catch a ball? 
I don't know why Joe Anderson isn't on a roster.  He's easily a #4 guy with the potential to be more.  And outstanding at special teams.
Anyone with this much drive would be more than welcomed in New England.
I'm willing to sign him to my fantasy team
Why the Texans? We're really deep in C+/B- tier receivers already.
All things considered, he should be considered.
he is outside the wrong stadium, they have plenty of WRs, he should go to Carolina and compete with any of what we have. 
Maybe he can come to Ireland in play for my team. He would dominate &amp; I would feed him all the sandwiches he wants.
Man I hope someone gives him a chance. That's pretty cool actually. 
I should stop by and see him.
It's not like the Texans would ignore a dude with NFL experience standing outside with a sign. We can presume they aren't interested.
Can we give this guy a shot instead of Hardy?
Takes some serious humility to do something like this. I hope he gets another shot somewhere and does something with it.
If this works, every stadium will be overflowing with these hybrid hobo/athletes waving signs all over 
Who the hell is Joe Anderson? Did I miss when he was in Chicago?

EDIT: apparently I wasn't crazy for not remembering him: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AndeJo00.htm
I love that he's wearing cleats
The best part about this is he's got cleats on. Dude's ready to go.
It'd be better if he was holding a boombox.
#hungryforinstagramfollowers
He is the wrong town. JETS are so shallow at that spot due to injuries they would have atleast let him inside the building for a workout.
[Joe Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNnzyaWX5Jw) 
I admire his guile, hope he gets a shot 
At the very least, since he's in Houston, dude could fill in as a stunt double for James Harden.
Buccaneers need help. Lots. Can't hurt.
He might have the physical prowess, but can he understand a playbook or run the right route (or make the right decision) at the right time?

Those are the prime reasons that you see dudes on the street or getting cut when they have the physical attributes of a pro bowler on the outside.
...think he could play oline?
Could he try out for GM?
Makes me wonder: Did anyone from Vet Combine get on a team?
I know its all about talent, but after seeing the pics of what Hardy did, I wish there were more dudes who actually appreciated being in the NFL like this guy.

Holy shit this guy is ready to start working out! Has his cleats and gloves on and everything! Even has a jug of water!

Hope it works out for him!
Was he a bad player when he played? I don't remember him
As a Bears fan... Who?
I love religious people. "Lord it's in your hands I know you'll get me back to the nfl". Whyd the Lord let you get cut in the first place?
That's awesome!
Somebody sign this fucking guy already! 
I'll take his attitude over Quintin Patton's 10 times outta ten!

Come to Santa Clara Joe!
Oh Joe...
Should've held up a boom box playing "In Your Eyes," that's the best way to get a second chance
Damn. Putting a lot of pressure on the Texans there, eh?
I'd give him a shot after having my trainers teach him about a little something called "leg day."
can someone post a mirror of that in here? IG is blocked at my job :/
Can he play qb?
Does this work?   Can I try this maybe? 
Pretty sure the Ravens have a spot
How I think the Texans should handle this: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dH-mUOdxnKg
Outside the Texans facility? Too bad he isnt willing to throw passes for food.
How are his hands?
Would not be shocked if pete carroll brought him in. 
Can he catch
He should play arena or CFL if he's that interested in football.
Forgive me for asking but whose Joe Anderson?

Edit: I answered my own question and for anybody else wondering, [heres a link to his wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Anderson_(American_football\))
Those are some fresh cleats, [Billy "White Shoes" Johnson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0EVm7fi0iQ) (former Houston player) would be proud.
Can he be a gunner?  Seattle might want to take a look at him if so dude looks like he could blow some people up.
Jesus Christ. This looks pathetic 
Dude you went to college on a scholarship go get a job somewhere with your degree. 
why can't it just be about football, why so religious?
I do hope this guy finds success, but seriously, fuck putting hashtags on a cardboard sign.
[deleted]
He's putting his faith so hard in God, maybe he should take that sign to a church.  They could probably use a super successful alter boy to run routes.
He wrote hastags on a cardboard sign. By hand. This cannot be someone mentally healthy.
The part where he says he'll hit the ref too if he's in the way probably should have been omitted.
A tad strange when compared to successful football players
Dude needs to stop skipping leg day.
He's probably not on a team because of all that annoying ass God talk.  Everything he says is lord this, lord that.  that would be fucking irritating in a locker room.  
Is he using hashtags on a sign? Really?
Two years ago the San Jose Sharks had a rookie that scored 4 goals in a game and celebrated in an exuberant manner. During an interview Joe Thornton told a media member they were making too big of a deal about the celebration and said "if I scored 4 goals in a game I'd have my cock out. I'd have my cock out, stroking it."

If an NFL player said something similar,  how much would they be fined?
Did he seriously do 3 pumps?

Carson "Hingle McCringleberry" Palmer
Good. My kids were asking me about what Palmer did and I had no idea what to do. I showed them DX highlights for the next 36 hours and told them all about how much they wanted everyone to 'suck it'. They were very traumatized.

How dare you Carson Palmer. How dare you. If the NFL had any balls, he would be suspended for the rest of the season, but we all know how weak Roger Goodell is these days. SMH. 
THE PELVIC WOO

It's all fun and games until every woman in Arizona suddenly gives birth in August 2016 .
Man, I'd be fined all the damn time for that if I was in the NFL. 
Is it because he forgot to stop on his right foot?
$69 fine.
&gt;‚ÄúI had my buddies in the sideline, right four or five rows up. I saw them pretty excited and [that] got me excited to see them excited.‚Äù

Man, FUCK Roger Goodell. The man has done nothing but run the league into the ground philosophically. Sure it's extremely popular, but I defy you to name one thing he's done that has been responsible for that.
Jesus who cares
If it weren't for the NFL, the NFL would be a lot more awesome.  
This just in: NFL has a 1 pump rule.
It's just a ~~step~~ jump to the left ....
I thrust in your general direction!
I've been waiting for this...knew it would happen
Didn't von Miller get fined for the pelvic thrust 
What a thug
http://youtu.be/RGJb2iLvOKE
But it was [only 1 thrust](http://img.ifcdn.com/images/a4e886fccdefbdb98c8870f99acb2596b83e80249a2a9226a993c8df31e017c9_1.gif)
L'Carpetron Dookmarriot would never do such a vulgar thing.
Meanwhile, Cam Newton continues to be crucified for his sickening and immature "dancing".  This league just isn't SFW anymore.  Maybe not even SFL.
NFL, lets make football boring.
Meanwhile the dancers and cheerleaders on the sidelines thrust their stuff left and right as the announcer does a plug for the NFL's latest charity initiative for families...
Carson "Hingle McCringleberry" Palmer
Worth it.

Everyone will say to think of the children, but the real victims here are Pup and Sugar Cane. 
Lol
Oh come on! That was one pump!
[We need someone to do the Crash Bandicoot dance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w5kMoYcTSs).
Sheesh, if those who give out the fines consider that a thrust, I pitty their wives.
[Duffman likes what he sees](http://persephonemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/uexc_attach/duffman.gif)
Let the players live! The NFL has become a shell of its former self in this sense.. A player makes a good play, he should be able to celebrate how he wants without getting fined or the media blowing it out of proportion. Cam danced in the endzone last week, and gets a scolding letter from a fan for it. Deangelo Williams wants to honor his mom by wearing pink throughout the season but the league told him he'd be fined if he did. Everything has become too PC in the NFL and Roger Goodell is the reason. Celebrations and expressions are what made the league great. Unfortunately, that league we all grew to love is in the past and its a shame. End Rant 
I bet a white quarterback wouldn't have been fined. 
But it was just one thrust...

http://imgur.com/PySQ11H
pelvic WOOOOO
Let's have half dressed women ON THE SIDELINE, whose sole purpose is to be sexual objects, but a dude throwing some hip around is worth front page news and a multi thousand dollars fine? The fuck?! 
Joe Buck thinks he should be fined for that "disgusting act."
That was less of a celebration and more of a "suck my dick" statement.
Everyone knows you only get two thrusts!
Good! He should be fined! After all, it's the pelvic thrust that really drives you insane.
Worth every god damn penny.
worth it
One pump??! You're supposed to get two before they start throwing flags!
The NFL: 
NO.  FUN.  LEAGUE.
That celebration has become one of my favorite gifs.  So, naturally, it's going to come with a fine.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJb2iLvOKE
I literally don't see the difference between this and Rodgers' title belt..  ahem...  discount double-check
I thought up to two pelvic thrusts was okay?
One of Decoud's shining moments http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/50fc537beab8ea1250000049/thomas-decloud-gif.gif
Can't believe this young role model pumped three times. 
Will cheerleaders be fined for pelvic thrusts, as well?
Oh for fucks sakes, REALLY?
... that really drives ~~you~~ the league insa-a-ain!
Since this is still "Bash Greenbay" week, I will point out how close this resembles the discount double check Rodger's does, and if he doesn't get fined, Palmer shouldn't.
Ridiculous. Ironically, if the League wasn't making a big deal about this, no one would be talking about it in the first place. 

The bottom line though is that gesture was so innocuous I can't believe someone would get fined for it. Absurd.
This is so dumb. Its just a celebration, people need to get off his dick 
#DXGate
Good to see the NFL going after the real scumbags in the league
Did lynch get fined for holding his junk when ran it in?
The rulebook says two pumps...
Why is excessive celebration a penalty? isn't this just a sport and people should be having fun playing it? The NFL takes itself way too serious.  
Will no one think of the children ?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJb2iLvOKE
Even if he isn't, I'll make sure to have my mom write him a strongly worded letter about it.
Seahawks fan here: Fuck that, that is pure bullshit and I have seen celebrations 1000000 times worse that go unnoticed.
No Fun League strikes again.
I'm pretty sure [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJb2iLvOKE) could almost never be more relevant
I don't see what the big deal is. It was only one thrust, you don't get flagged until three.
Stupid fine, fuck 
#3 PUMPS
Key &amp; Peele - McCringleberry's Excessive Celebration
https://youtu.be/RGJb2iLvOKE
For some reason I have a feeling no angry mothers sent a letter to the local media complaining about him doing that like that wonderful Titans fan did to complain about Cam's "arrogant strutting."
It was only one though
Really if that's what you choose to complain about then maybe you shouldn't watch any tv or go any place that has other people.  
It's a football game FFS let them have a little fun.  

And yet there wasn't an uproar about the shot of Peyton bending over to stretch and you could see everything and the camera stayed on him like that for at least 45 seconds.  
Worth it.
I love that people get offended by things like this.  Makes it a lot funnier.
First of all, the fine is totally worth it. Second of all, I'm pretty sure that if there was an option for the NFL fans to pay fines (not that the players need it, I'm just saying if it was an option), I'm pretty sure there are a ton of fans who would chip in to cover the cost.  Fucking WORTH IT.
lol reminds me of this [Key &amp; Peele sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJb2iLvOKE)
[relevant Key and Peele pelvic thrust celebration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGJb2iLvOKE)
Oh fuck the fuck off
Cause it was a fine pelvic thrust ?
Classic case of "life imitates art"
This is really stupid.
The thing I find strange is that this is not that much different than Rodgers belt motion. It's nowhere near Von Miller's but w/e.
Maybe he should fine the network for Airing it too, and the people for watching it.  God forbid anyone shows a little passion and excitement for the game.  We can't all celebrate like Drew Stanton.
Can somebody actually link the celebration, and not the K&amp;P sketch?
[Insert Key &amp; Peele reference here]
For all of you saying "good." Carson Palmer is a reserved guy. This was a game changing win against our biggest rival in their home stadium? Cut the man some slack, he was celebrating which is something he hardly does. Who the hell knows what I would do when the excitement takes over. I know when I played sports against my rivals and won, excitement just takes over. But my god that was a beautiful win for us! 
Carson Palmer/Cam newton memes will becoming. "Why was Carson fined but not Cam?"
Good. We don't need pelvic thrusts in the NFL. Think of the fucking children who saw that and are now doing that at school. 

*Brought to you by Cialis and Viagra. Get your dick hard by a pill when God doesn't come through. 
Wasn't even on the field...
Fined for not making a football move.
Worth it.
It's because he forgot to stop on his right foot. 
Goodel pls. 
It's probably a good thing the game this week vs the Bengals is in Arizona.  Fans might taunt him similarly during the game.
Pelvic thrust! Wooooooooo! Wooooooooo! Stop on your right foot, don't forget it!
For his... on the sideline celebration...?  Cmon man.
Dont like 20% of the players do a pelvic thrust when celebrating ? Von Miller or Lance Moore both come to mind off the top of my head. 
Shoulda just held his dick
What the fuck NFL really? Go fuck yourself 
It's that third pump.
Should of stuck with 2 thrusts.
Jesus Christ.. The league is really stretching now. I'm really ashamed.

No Fun League just keeps on getting worse
I've been traumatized by the ~~Cardinals~~ Carson Palmer, might as well vacate their wins, right?
lol Carson Palmer makes a headline like this in 2015. Get after it Carson, good for you. 
Back in the 50s not many people approved of Elvis's hip movements. So Carson Palmer is Elvis.
Do you think the front office has some sort of tally? Like "time to fine a white dude."
Are you fucking serious?
[Lance Moore did a better job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3U-skq9DBQ)
He should do it for every TD he throws from now on. 
Wow. I guess the players can't celebrate anymore? Fucking hate the NFL
Anyone got sauce?
What year is it? Didn't Elvis Presley get fined for this?
Worth it
The cheerleaders however, will not be fined. 
Oh no. Kids are going to find out what sex is from a vague taunt in a football game!
All of this over just one pump, unbelievable!
the Nerf F L 
Dude, why does the NFL have such a stick up it's butt all the time.
I'm sure nothing will happen in the end. We'll just leave it up to Michael Bennett to answer back in Week 17.

Now if Richard Sherman did that though!? 
Who does he think he is? Hingle McCringleberry? 
That is fucked up, he only did one thrust!
I assume drew Stanton will get fined for his amazing dance moves on the sideline?
hingle mccringleberry?

I THOUGHT THE LIMIT WAS THREE PUMPS
He was on the sideline and did it!? So fucking what! Leave it alone
Saints did it right
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3U-skq9DBQ
If the pelvic thrust becomes illegal, it means that the [Time Warp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkplPbd2f60) will be totally off limits as a celebration. 

Is this the kind of world we want to live in?
I hope not.  That's a pretty minor thing, and since it's on the sidelines it is pretty harmless.
And it's the pelvic thrust that really drives Goodell insay-ay-ay-ane! Let's do the time warp again!
So dumb. Seriously, for whose benefit is this???
Thats just rediculous.
Christ. 
Carson Elvis Presley Palmer
Literally no one fucking cared or even talked about it till you said something.  Get fucked Goodell. 
"That is disgusting. That is a disgusting, classless move by [Caraon Palmer] I'm sorry we had to show that to you on the air folks." Timeless words from the legendary joe buck.
I ain't even mad
It really drives you insa-a-a-ane.
But it's the pelvic thrust. 
That'll drive you inannnnnnnne!
carson why you gotta do us like that
Football is so weird when it comes to out-of-game penalties and such.

In baseball if you get into a verbal argument with an ump it can get you ejected. In the NFL you have to kill a ref's firstborn before they'll eject you from the game.

Yet at the same time, the NFL has these weird "I know it when I see it" kind of rules for excessive celebration after scoring a touchdown? What?
I might grab my dick next time
What is this fucking Elvis in the 1950s?
Nailed it!!!
Why am I not finding the key and peele video in the top comments? 
Makes sense.  Didn't they fine Elvis for this also.  Oh ya, that was like 60 years ago.  Idiots.
IVE GOT TWO WORRRRRRDS FOR YA....You're fined 
Let's just fine them all for not being robots. That's the point, right?
I've scrolled past this headline about 6 times on my front page today and giggled every time. 
I'm torn, but not really. I feel like if players get fined for stupid, non-fine-worthy bullshit; then they should be fined equally for said bullshit. On the other hand, shut up and let the dudes do their thing- they're fired up. I'd be pissed if I did something badass, celebrated a bit out of norm, and lost my end of year bonus for it.
Can we fine Roger Goodell for his vulgar, obscene, and unsportsmanlike existence as a massive pussy? 
http://i.imgur.com/tt4wO.gif
Another victim of Pop-Culture. Only us non-famous people can do this. You are famous, you can't do these simple things. I can do the Drake dance at work, you cannot do it on the field. I can do the McCringlberry  poorly like you at work, and nothing will happen to me. 
Did he do it 3 times? Then fine him.
DEGENERATE IS A SOMETHING FOOLS PALMER JUS GOT TIRED OF DOIN WHATCHA TOLD HIM TO DO, that's a right Goodell man...thats a right lil man BREAK IT DOWN!

THINK OF THE CHILDREN
Should girls be shamed for any mild provocative gesture they give? No. Leave Parlmer alone. Poor gal
I think a 7 game suspension would be more appropriate. :)
If it was Cam Newton, it'd probably be ok
All of these sexual acts are making the NFL really difficult to watch. 
Suspend him too, completely unacceptable behavior.
hahaha god damn it NFL. that was fucking great. 
Well, they fined Marshawn for the crotch grab last time we played the Cards, so it'd only be fair.
Doesn't matter, had sex.
[Good](http://makeagif.com/qz2eP-)
I guess it's only allowed and therefore OK if Cam Newton does it. 
That's raycis. Cam should be like suspended or something for the lewd display he put on. Got some single mom all hot and bothered up in the sands. 
That is a *disgusting* act.
White Lives Matter /S
Good. He told the audience to suck it. Fine him.
Man. Best wishes to him. Hell of a year for him.
At least he'll have the rest of the season plus offseason to heal up. That's rough though I feel really bad for him. 
That honestly sucks. I've broken my collarbone 3 times. Twice on the same shoulder. To break it right after being cleared to play is awful as well. Sorry about the season Cowboy fans. Good luck next year.

Also, was his collarbone 100%? 
"This person had been dead inside for 7 weeks, revived for 2, and his spirit killed again on 11/26 after the Cowboys game."

"Who is boobdood, Alex"
Damn, really sucks to lose an entire year to injury when he's already had all these injury issues, plus he's getting up there in age
That sucks. I was rooting for the Romo comeback tour of destruction. Hopefully he can do it next year. 
Broke his collarbone and my heart
Giants NFC East Champions confirmed? 
Hey Cowboys, I got a quarterback you guys might like. How about a 2nd round pick and a ham sandwich?
That really sucks for him. I hope this doesn't become an injury that plagues the rest of this career.
Legit question, even if Romo were to have sat out this entire season would his collarbone still be as vulnerable to breaking to a hit like the one he suffered today?

 I broke my collarbone once and remember upon doing my own research at the time I found out that not only is it the easiest bone to break but the clavicle also becomes more susceptible to being broken again in the future.

I ask because it seems like his collarbone is a huge liability and I wonder if this will largely impact whether or not it ends his career earlier than expected.
Holy shit. This fuckin' sucks. Right when he came back, he's done.

You know it's bad when you feel bad for cowboys' fans
I love Romo as a person and he's incredibly fun to watch as a player, you hate to see this. Get well soon Tony
...At least it's not an ACL? I don't know what else to say. Sorry Cowboys fans
tebow time!
What a shit year for QBs :(
Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but Dallas really shouldn't have had him out there to win all of the remaining games. He should have healed up and came back next year. 
Daym...sorry Cowboys...that sucks so much.
The NFC East is just fucked man. We should put our differences aside and just start a support group where we all drink heavily.
Forget my flair, I honestly love this guy. He has my best wishes and hope for a speedy recovery.
Dude is a warrior. Here's hoping for a speedy recovery.
I  hate the Cowgirls as much as the next guy, but the NFL is a better place with Romo in it. See ya next year buddy. We can have the division race we were supposed to have this year.
This is the darkest timeline. 
Hope for a speedy recovery for the guy 
I think he'll still win the MVP. 
Anyone who is saying the Cowboys should invest in a new QB is insane.  I'd rather go all in on Tony having another few solid seasons, AT LEAST.  

Mike Glennon maybe?  
Hopefully we lose our last games so we can get a good draft pick
That sucks, the Cowboys are my number 2 team, and I was looking forward to a Romo led miracle surge to take the East.  

Here's hoping to a complete recovery and he comes back with fire next year.
I really want Romo to win one before he's done.

He's so damn likable this sucks :/
Damn man I love Romo. Hope he heals up stronger than ever
Has there ever been a better QB appreciated less than Romo?
Fuck the owner, fuck the coaching staff, fuck the doctors, fuck anyone who told him to come back after 6 weeks with that. 3 months and you can probably play collision sports again.   
  
Anyone who has ever had this injury would tell you it feels fine at 6 weeks, but is super fragile. There's nothing out of the ordinary with that sack, but luck has nothing to do with that reinjury. That will happen to anyone's 6 week old broken collerbone every single time, and if you can't take that hit, you shouldn't be on the field. 
When they gave the timetable on him, I was worried about him reaggrivating his injury. When you take those rolling hits, it's just hard. The way they kept just losing just sped up the return date. Maybe I'm just more pessimistic as I grow older. You look at these guys get plowed and wonder how much the body can take at times. 
Damn. Poor guy. He's a fucking warrior though. I gotta respect his resilience. 
For those asking if his collarbone was fully healed: no way. I broke mine in high school playing rugby. Clean break, no screws or surgery needed, just time. After ~3 weeks you get full motion range. After ~6-8 weeks I was allowed to put weight on it. After about 3 months I was able to treat it as "normal," but my doctor warned me that contact sports and taking hits was risking rebreaking it. He told me it takes 6 full months minimum to regain normal collarbone strength. Romo clearly played knowing these risks.

TL;DR it takes 6 months for a collarbone to fully heal
I kind of hate the Cowboys but man I can't help but feel bad for Tony. He just seems like such a likeable guy and I think his DirecTV ad makes him even more likeable. This is the third time I've seen him break his collarbone. Hopefully he can heal and we see him play AZ soon. Those are always big games. 
What a horrible year for football.

Damn i wonder if he has a healthy season left in him, im already looking towards next year so these next games wont hurt as much.

Fucking upper management. Romo clearly was not ready to return yet they put him in anyways to "win out" and take the division because DAE NFC East suxs. 
Honestly I wonder how much romo can take?  I mean he can heal and recover next year but what would be the chances he could get really f'd up again next go round?
I recommend Romo for the weapon x program
*sighs* For the second time this year "*hello darkness my old friend*"
He's talented, and has a big heart, but how valuable is he to the Cowboys if this KEEPS happening? Clearly, last year, we see that when Tony is healthy, he's got the goods. But factor in the year before, and now this season--this looks to be a trend of Romo struggling to stay healthy.
I've already made peace with this. I'm ready for a bunch of losses to end the season, and a good draft pick.

Now I'll be hoping the Redskins and Giants compete for the division, with the winner getting blown out in the first round of the playoffs - and I'm looking very forward to watching the Eagles continue to implode.

Start Kellen Moore. 
Tough break for the 'Boys.
I'm just going to go ahead and say the Greg Hardy signing brought some bad joo joo in Boys clubhouse. 
Look at the bright side, you guys probably weren't going to hit your usual 8-8 this year anyway. There's always next year to remain completely average and overrated.
Hope he comes back next year and feels comfortable and confident with it. A true shame. 


I'm tired of football.
This is terrible. I'm said I didn't get to see him play all year but saw the Cowboys without him which was awful. He's an awesome quarterback. Hope he has a smooth recovery.
Hey we'll trade you one manziel for some picks cowboys, you just have to provide your own inflatable swans.
I said this in the game thread but I'll repeat it here: Romo should retire, but the dude is too much of a warrior to let this be the end of him. I honestly would expect him to keep playing until he's physically unable to.
Man,  sorry Cowboys' fans,  tough break here.  I know pre-season there was so much promise with the new defensive additions and the offensive line.  It sucks  how things turned out. 
I just heard a loud pop and a flash of light, I think Shay from Irving just blew up!
Unreal 
I broke my collarbone 3 times the same year. I know how it goes.
That was sure fun while it lasted. Yeesh.
Is Stone Cold still available?
That explains all the bad throws, he wasnt healed yet 
Was that injury really healed? Hm. 
Well, now we can possibly get a high draft pick.

I honestly think we need another huge WR like Dez.  Maybe a RB.

If not offense then a shut down corner.  Maybe a great Free Safety.  A defensive lineman.


At some point you have to wonder about tying your franchise's fortunes to a guy who just can't stay healthy.

What I wouldn't give for a talented ironman at this point.
Tony is a gamer, he should have been held back longer but the Cowboys have no class, and are always delusional about their chances.  Of course he wanted to play as soon as he felt better, thats what a gamer does, its up the management to protect him in the long run.
Everything is sadness. What a terrible year in every way.
Damnt Greg Williams stop taking out qbs!
Hopefully this ends the "but if the Cowboys win their last ___ games in a row they have a chance!" nonsense I've been hearing on ESPN Radio
Well, that sucks for him, and especially DAL
Wow that sucks
I really like Romo. Seems like a really nice, genuine and upbeat guy. 


This is just awful. Can't be a fun time for him either physically or mentally. I feel for him. 
At least Dallas will have a high draft pick this year and they really should get a QB for situations like this.
Awful. Watching this game, it seemed like he knew exactly what happened when it happened. He went down with his arm up toward his collarbone and then slammed his arm down in frustration.

So terrible. Hate to see him get back just to re-aggravate. Hope he gets nice and healthy over the offseason.
Honest question... at what point does continually breaking his collarbone end his career?
Do they get a wish on a broken collarbone? Asking for a friend.
[deleted]
Time to trade for Johnny. 
As a Browns fan, this is terrible. Good ole John football will be there in no time
Stupid to have brought him back in the first place. So dumb.
No surprise here.
And back to losing 
RIP in Peace
[deleted]
Stinks for him and for the Cowboys. Must feel like a lost year. 

On a selfish note... It's too bad the Bills didn't attach some sort of games started incentive to the Cassel trade. 
Hate Dallas, but have the upmost respect for Romo. Best wishes to him. 
Hello 8-8 (at best), my old friend.
Once again illustrating why you should never rush back from injuries, especially broken bones.
The "dr Jerry Jones" is probably the funniest thing on this sub to me personally. But in all honesty how much of a say does he have? 
Oh man. Maybe we can get a 2nd or 3rd rounder from Jerry Jones for Johnny Manziel this offseason now.
A GoFundMe to buy out Tony Romo:'s contract in Dallas and maybe save his life. 
I feel like the stars are aligning for Jerry to finally get Manziel in Dallas.
I worry that this is a career ender for him.

Reinjury seems like it's not the best scenario.  I had repeat ankle injuries in my early teens, and it was such an awful recovery.
Wow...didn't see that one coming
They might as well start hyping the team for 2016 now.
what are the odds the Cowboys wind up with RG3? No ***way*** is Washington going to pay him ~$16M to sit on the bench next year, and for that kind of money he has zero trade value, so he will almost certainly be cut this offseason. 
[Officially official] (https://twitter.com/jonmachota/status/670280246273273856)
He really should've gone under the knife on this second break. 

There's a bit of double talk going on. The article reads that Romo knew reinjury was high risk then it has the Cowboys questioning if he returned too early..

Seeing that it was his third break of the same side of the collarbone and none of the breaks were surgically repaired I'd think the answer is yes.

This being such a common QB injury I'm surprised that his very first break wasn't surgically repaired. 
People are really positive and friendly here.

Maybe it's because I got completely shitfaced after that Eagles game, and maybe it's because I'm a bitter, angry, piece of shit, lowlife scumbag,  Philadelphia sports fan, but the Romo injury and Okafor cold-cocking a Boston fan made my Thanksgiving a lot better.
ouch
This a bummer.  I liked watching Romo throw ints.  Now MC will go in there and play better than Romo.  
Tony Romo is way to fragile. 

Edit: lol really? He's always getting hurt. 
Dude is paper mache at this point. That tackle wasn't anything substantial and his fucking collarbone breaks?
Can you be a great QB without making at least a conference championship?  
Not good. 
Man he needs to get a few bones replaced with titanium
The most fucked up part about the Cowboys 2015 failure? 

I predicted this exact scenario somewhere on a reddit thread before the season started. 

Ugh. 
So is it time for the Cowboys to start thinking about drafting another QB? Romo is 35 and has been Mr.Glass his whole career 
So is it time for the Cowboys to start thinking about drafting another QB? Romo is 35 and has been Mr.Glass his whole career 
so no Romobyl this year?
Never liked Romo but very sad for him to see his career likely ended in this way, and before all you cryers show up saying he'll be so great next year.....collar bones have a great tendency to re break and he just rebroke that mofo- that bone will be glass like after 2 back to back breaks. Although Jerry can probably afford an exo skeleton.......
Don't worry Cowboys fans, it was an ESPN story.  It was probably "made more TV friendly", and the sources are "NFL Insiders" (aka PR folks who spout anything if it increases ratings)
If I up vote this, does it show support for romo or does it mean I'm glad he's out?
inb4 it's Jerry's fault
I hope they get a solid replacement, that guy is made of egg shells... Romo sucks
I hate when I go to the wrong porn site.
Interestingly enough, this means that [Pete Carroll has now posted a unique score in every one of the six  seasons he's been in Seattle.](http://www.sbnation.com/2014/9/8/6110147/pete-carroll-seahawks-scoragami-weird-nfl-scores)
[Neat](http://giant.gfycat.com/DopeyMelodicDogwoodtwigborer.gif)
Russell Wilson is 1-0 all time in games ending 39-30.
http://i.imgur.com/4P4AcxW.gifv
There have been about 15,500 NFL games played.

I'm impressed that this is the first time this score has happened, but when you use the tool it's not all that surprising.

40-30 has only happened once. 42-30 has only happened once. 45-30 has never happened.

But, oddly enough, 38-30 has happened 5 times, all after 1980.
This is the 2nd unique score game for the Steelers this year. The first one coming week vs. the 49ers when the score was 43-18
Way to steal the next 373525 hours of my life.


Some notes:
I always knew Bears 73-0 Redskins was the largest margin of victory ever but I could have sworn I'd seen a team put up more than 73 points in a game at some point but just win by less than 73.  Apparently not.

There have been 74 0-0 ties.

There has never been a 2-2 tie.

One team (the Chicago Cardinals) have scored exactly 4 points in a 10-4 loss.

Only 2 of the 5 ever 2-0 games were between two true NFL teams and not a pro vs amateur game.  It was the Packers over the Bears and the Bears over the Packers.

One week Green Bay and Milwaukee tied 0-0 and then the following week both teams tied their respective games 0-0.

The Redskins were on the receiving end of the worst loss ever (73-0) but won the game with the highest point total ever (72-41).
Shockingly, the Colts 25-12 win over Tampa Bay was not the onyl time, but rather the third time that weird ass score took place.
It was pretty crazy how the scoring worked, it was like watching a game of Madden between two fanatics. So many two point attempts, a blocked PAT, a disastrous fake field goal... honestly, we just needed someone to go for it on 4th and 15 from their own 25.
You know I'm glad that the stat "Russell Wilson has never won a game where his defense allowed more than 25 points" can finally go away. 
Yeah, but what's the *weirdest* score a game has ever ended in? I'm hoping it's something with repeating decimals.
The other scores that haven't happened before

http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_scores_miss.cgi
Never underestimate the football analyst's ability to generate unnecessary and largely pointless statistics and facts.
I have a feeling we will be getting these weird scores a lot more often with the change of rules concerning extra points.
Seahawks always seem to score weird scores. 39, 32, 29, 26. It's like we're never winning games 21-7. It's always 22-9.
All those 2 pt conversions, man. Steelers kept doing it so the Seahawks had to keep doing it lol
And there's this unique score: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_scores_find.cgi?pts_win=43&amp;pts_lose=8
With the ability to go for 2 point conversions after a touchdown, you'll be seeing more and more odd scores in the future. 
The weirdest part is only that they had 6 touchdowns but only 39 points. Has that ever happened before?
[10-4 good buddy!](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/192311250crd.htm)
Not quite. If you said American football history, you would be correct, but the CFL has had 39-30 scores before. The BC Lions beat the Ottawa Rough Riders 39-30 on August 31, 1989. It may have happened before or after that as well, that was just the first one I found with a quick Google search.
I am shocked /u/jaguargator9 didn't post this.
That's because nobody is dumb enough to kick a field goal on 4th and goal when you're that close and need a touchdown, with a weak defense.
He won one!
Who wants to assemble a list of scores that the NFL hasn't seen yet?
Go us?
Professional football history*
[Scoragami](http://www.sbnation.com/2014/9/8/6110147/pete-carroll-seahawks-scoragami-weird-nfl-scores)

It's always the fucking Seahawks. 
Who sits down and digs through stats to find these things?  
  
Today was the first time in NFL history where a player was hurt in the 4th quarter while in the endzone during a waning gibbous moon while wearing blue.  
  
.. cool, man...
This happens a couple of times every season or two if I remember correctly. 
Are we going to see an influx of unusual end scores because of the changes to PAT?
Every season has about 5-10 new unique final scores.

http://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2013/10/unique-scores-in-pro-football-games/
Illuminati confirmed. 
I bet there will be a lot more unique scores due to the new PAT rule.
I think we'll continue to see a lot more unique scores in the coming years since we made this XP kick line change. Now the likelihood of 6 points instead of 7 points on a touchdown went from &lt;1% to more like 6%, which means instead of 2-3 games a year where it happens, we're instead looking at more like 15-20 of them. More importantly, the attempts at 2-pt conversion that will happen with more frequency as teams try to catch up from losing XPs will also help change up the frequency of certain scores.
I'm disappointed this wasn't posted by the weird stats guy.
And they are 9 and 9 out of 18 games.

Last two games Seahawks lost in blowouts.
huh, there hasn't been a [7-0](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/game_scores_find.cgi?pts_win=7&amp;pts_lose=0) game since [1983](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198312040nwe.htm) 
With the longer one point conversions unique scores will happen more often I bet.
That's pretty awesome, I remember a few years ago when the Steelers game ended 11-10
Show me 4 to 2 and then I'll be impressed.
This sub needs a r/mildlyinterestingnfl sub because this clutters up the board.
This was the score of a game last week that I played in my flag league.  So no.  Not football history.
I posted this exact same fact (with a different score) when the Steelers beat the 49ers 43-18 in week 2 and my post was removed!
Not sure if this is impressive or just cherry picked... 
All these ridiculous stat threads are so pointless... 
That whole Jacksonville facility looks amazing.  
Oh no, please be a joke about the Lions...
I had in my mind that there was little disparity between locker rooms. My tiny sheltered world just destroyed. 

For those interested, these are the Iowa Hawkeye [visitor locker rooms.] (http://static.nfl.com/static/content/public/pg-photo/2015/06/24/0ap3000000498685/14-iowa-pink-visiting-locker-room_pg_600.jpg) 
Anyone else notice that the focal point of the Jets locker room is garbage cans? 
Holy hell San Diego. That can't be the Chargers full time locker room. This is a fucking professional football team and that's more barren than a 60 year old woman.
[This is what the Vikings are currently using](http://cfbsection.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Minnesota-Gophers-TCF-Bank-Stadium-locker-room.jpg).
49ers, Bucs, Giants, and Jags are the best.  
I saw the Browns picture and thought "Man, I'd hate to play there." Then I saw the Chargers pic and thought "Ok, maybe the Browns locker room isn't so bad."

That Jaguars locker room is amazing, though. Definitely my favorite of the bunch.
https://www.flickr.com/photos/shifta/3556818833
Jaguars win.
I thought Cleveland was bad, then I saw the Chargers. Holy apathy.

What's weird, though, is Pittsburgh is very plain but doesn't look boring. Just blue-collar.
http://i.imgur.com/ebnuRP2.jpg

Potato quality panorama of the real(?) lions locker room.
No wonder the Jags lose a lot.  I'd be focused on getting back to the locker room as soon as possible too.  That place is nice as hell.
TIL Jaguars suit up in a strip club.
That's the Raiders practice field locker rooms. And Jesus is the Colts one at a prison?
Damn Vikings is sexy (And computer generated)

http://i.imgur.com/knEa4lC.jpg
Love the sub on top of the locker in the Lions pic, haha.
Giants have the best

Some of these pictures are terrible, but I thought it may be interesting to some people.

If anyone has better pictures let me know and I'll make a new gallery.
For those curious:

[This](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BqwQ8IDCYAAS85k.jpg) is the locker room the Vikings currently use at TCF Bank Stadium.


The Lions one is a joke, right? 
The Niners &amp; Jags locker rooms look amazing...definitely the best

But if the Vikings locker room looks just like what it was rendered...I'm sorry, but it would just top them both.
Bills, Broncos and Jaguars look the best.  Please tell me the Lions one is fake?
If I was a Free Agent visiting the Jags, I would sign asap just on the locker room alone, that shit is beautiful. 
The Browns one makes me sad

http://i.imgur.com/S7VYduY.jpg
I think the Bills and Jaguars have outdone themselves in terms of their locker rooms. The Lions, if that is the actual picture, are pretty pathetic. The Raiders are mehh. The Bengals' carpet is an eyesore. 
[Here's the Niners visiting locker room.  I love it.](http://media.nbcbayarea.com/images/601*338/VISITOR-LOCKER-ROOM-VO---00000709.jpg)
The Radiers have a real high school feel to their locker room. And I say that as a good thing.
Did the owner just not give a fuck when they built the Chargers facilities? Like all of these that are real seem to share a floor, at least, but San Diego's is wayyy lower. That sucks :(
It still amazes me how so many college programs have just as nice,if not nicer, locker rooms than a lot of these.
A few thougts:


Dallas' looks like a night club


Jaguars or Giants looks the coolest


Forgot about that old (not that old) dolphins logo. He's a goofy fellow.
I want to be signed by the Jags. I can hold for punters probably.

The 49ers one is also great, as in Green Bay's. All class.
that's dirty. oh man i'm in tears 
Did anyone feel bad for the Cleveland Browns and their locker room? 
I really like the Jags and the Jets ones. 
I've been in the Ravens locker room a few times.  It's pretty unspectacular.

However, they only use it for game day so I can see why they don't make major renovations to it.  

The Ravens players spend a majority of their time at the Under Armour Training Facility in Owings Mills which is a state of the art facility.


I assumed ours would be the worst, but Detroit, damn. 
I love the sun windows in the Giants' locker room, giant sun footballs!
1 billion dollar stadiums, 100 million dollar contracts, 10$ folding chairs.


You get a better sense of the Seahawks locker room from the Real Rob Report.

edit: im dumb
Every single one of these is nicer than my house.
The Vikes locker room is sick!
Vikings is dope.  Looks like they are about to have a disco party.  

Some teams definitely need to be updated / remodeled. 
Is that some hidden part of the Buffalo locker room? I've been through a couple times during season ticket holder events, and it looked like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B0UJ_YBCMAA5-gm.jpg)... no lounge chairs or fancy lighting anywhere I could see.
Is that lions locker room for real ? 
You can tell that is a Detroit locker room because of the way it is. 
That Raiders locker room is positively depressing.
I'm not sure that these are very current... I was at the Dolphins locker room a week ago and it looks... um... very different.

Source: http://imgur.com/liv57M6
I assume the Lions one is a joke. There's no way it can be that bad. 
The Lions one is a joke right? right? There's not a real NFL lockerroom that bad?
is the best photo available of the charges locker room really one with an employee vacuuming the logo'd carpet? Surely there's a better pic
Lost my shit when i saw the Lions
San Diego "Best I Could Find" Chargers.
Jaguars stay turning up
The Jaguar's locker room could be a damn nightclub, they might as well install a bar!

The chargers and the browns locker rooms made me sad!
lol the lions room looks like an inner-city public high school locker room.
I was surprised to see two completely different locker rooms for the Jets and Giants.  Does the away team use the locker room that the home team isn't using, or is there a completely separate visitor's locker room too?
I like how the Jets locker room has trash cans all along the middle, in order to remind the players that their team is literal garbage.
The [Oregon Ducks](http://www.goducks.com/PhotoAlbum.dbml?PALBID=970348) have the best facilities BY FAR. Thanks to Nike of course.
Those Giants football skylights are nice...I want one!
That Browns one, oh god. 
There is no way in hell that's the Lions locker room.
You're so cruel.  Don't kick a team when their down
some of these pictures look outdated but still cool 

the jags O.o i want to live there 
Lions, really? The next depressing Locker Room is that of the Raiders. Agreed or Disagree? 
Giants look amazing.
Bills could have at least cleaned theirs up first.

Dallas is a study in lavender.

Lions... well.
I'm pretty sure the Seahawks one pictured is from their practice facility, not from CenturyLink Field.
SO that Lions locker room actually has some [truth](http://flyinglombardi.com/2014/06/01/this-once-was-an-nfl-stadium/) to it
Man, even the Bears locker room is still stuck in 1985. 
C'mon, Lions and Saints
I thought ours would have more teepees and wigwams in it.
I like the Jag's one the best
I think you got a picture of the Raider's training camp locker room.
Okay, so the Lions one is a joke. But the Chargers still looks pretty bad... I've seen high schools with nicer ones. 
Must be hard being a patriots fan and talking shit.
There's no way that Lions one is legit is it? Someones gotta be trolling...

Some of these are kinda depressing. Like all the hard work these athletes put in, they've achieved their dreams of playing at the highest level, and half or more of them probably had nicer locker rooms in college. They're professionals and I'd like to think that stuff like this isn't important to them, but I feel like it'd be a lot easier to love sacrificing yourself for the team if the team is sacrificing to make things for you. 

Who wants to end a day of hard fought gridiron football in that Brown's locker room? Like the most they're willing to do to make you comfortable is a 15" monitor and slap a browns logo on the plastic bins? 

Maybe I'm looking into it too much, or thinking that athletes care about it, but the worst locker rooms are owned by not so great organizations.
fuck this post

The Jags and Cowboys locker rooms look like nightclubs. The Giants is my favorite. It's very sleek.
The Chargers had the worst real one.
LOL Chargers and Lions
Anyone notice the beer sitting in one of the locker in the fake lions locker room pic
I don't understand how all these billion dollar teams give their players fucking folding chairs to sit on
That is not Tampas locker room at the stadium.  That is one buc place which is their practice facility(and very nice).  The locker room at the stadium is a joke, barely better then a local high school locker room. It is truly sad.
Is the chargers locker room a picture of them moving it to LA?
The only thing Cleveland puts their logo on is a trash can. 

....
God, even our locker room sucks. 
Detroit wtf. 
[Where our facility truly shines](https://40.media.tumblr.com/60ca22d7573cf547296df0f4ecb1707a/tumblr_n1fodtGuU11ttn6aro1_1280.jpg). 
Did you know the Cowboys have the largest locker room in the league because it is used for training camp as well as regular season and needs to support twice as many people?
Seahawks, Jaguars, and Bills all have lounge furniture in the middle of the locker room.  Not sure what to make of that when every other one is far more spartan.
How is it the Jets/Giants play in the same stadium, but the Giants locker room is 10x better looking than the Jets.
Nice of them to clean the place before the Chargers move down to Los Angeles. 
Pretty sure that lions one is a visitor locker room.  Probably not even for visiting NFL teams, but when h.s.  players play in the stadium.
Browns and Chargers looks notably dull. 
Anybody know which teams have training camp in their stadium and which have a facility or go elsewhere? Could explain the difference in some. 
It's probably just perspective but the Ram's locker room looks tiny.  Kroenke probably has a closet bigger than that.
I wonder what the visitor's locker room is like.
What team is that has an air intake in each locker, allowing all the smell to be sucked out?  I think it may be the Bucs but I am not sure as it has been a long time since I read about it.
I always wondered how they did the visitor's locker rooms. Like if they look like concrete dungeons with *maybe* a box of kleenex or something or if they are exactly equal to the home team's locker room
Cardinals  win in my book. 
I gotta say the Giants one is the best looking to me. Super nice looking. 
On the Vikings: Why would they essentially bring attention to the fact its a rendering with that crazy carpet? 
I think the Giants locker room looks really cool
I'm always surprised on how much some college locker rooms look 10x better then NFL locker room
God damn ours is pitiful. High school lockers rooms have looked better.
The Giants one  looks *way* cooler than the Jets one.  
How does the visiting locker room work at MetLife? Is there a third room for visitors, or are the Patriots going to use the Jets locker room in two weeks?
Wait. Don't the Jets and Giants play in the same stadium? How come their locker rooms are different? 
Dolphin locker room complete with Eye of Sauron
Goddamnit our locker room sucks 
I like a lot of these but don't like the locker room designs that have corners/parts that are cut off from the main room e.g the Cowboys, Saints, Dolphins rooms. I think it's good to have everyone in the same rectangular area rather than around corners.
What the hell is going on in Detroit!?!?
It would be nice if there was a gallery of the home locker room next to a pic of the visitors locker room for each stadium.

I am betting the fake Lions one is not too far off from some visitor locker rooms.
Love that Star on the wall, How Bout Them Boys
No wonder the lions arent very good
The Bills have a really nice [locker room](http://www.buffalobills.com/photos/photo-gallery/Sneak-peek-Inside-the-Bills-new-locker-room/b4b207c4-127d-495b-a219-783782679e62#start)
I would like to see the visitors locker room from each stadium.
I believe the Cardinals just got an update this off-season. Its along the lines of the Jaguars style. They had it on snap-chat before week one I believe. 
Now, someone make a gallery of all the locker rooms for the away team in those stadiums. I assume it'll look a lot like the Lions. 
Did the Jets locker room remind anybody else of [American Gladiators](http://www.tradingcarddb.com/Images/Cards/Misc%20Sports/81030/81030-6Fr.jpg)?
That isn't the Raiders locker room tho. http://a.fssta.com/content/dam/fsdigital/fscom/nfl/images/2015/10/11/1_f_20151011_1735_procast_TJCarrie_OaklandRaiders_3000_4500_1280x720_542599747543.vresize.1200.675.high.1.jpg

Not the clearest picture but this is the Raiders locker room. 
The Eagles locker room reminds me of a Dicks sporting goods checkout.
I dont know why teams put their logo all over the floor. Most teams wont walk on the logo and now you just cut your space in half.
I feel like there are two extremes. Either fucking awesome or shitty as fuck
Man, I really love the Dolphins logo they have there. We should go back to that one.
I really like the Bills actually.
I love the look of the colts one. That brick is very tasteful
Jaguars and Vikings were my favorites. Also wtf Lions? 
The first pic I went for was the Raiders, wasn't disappointed. 
A relatively shocking number of plain old drop ceilings given the money these teams make, would expect them all to look similar to the Giants.
ours is so damn bad -_-.
Some of these seem to me like they are practice facility locker rooms and not the ones at the actual stadiums.
No wonder the Jags have trouble winning. That looks like a lounge, not a locker room. 
I clicking around laughing at some of them, then I got to ours.
I think this is a mix of stadium locker rooms along with practice facility locker rooms. I know the Seahawks one is their practice facility at the VMAC and not at the stadium.
Anyone else disappointing in their team's locker room? I mean cmon Falcons! Plain floor and stock lights and vent on the ceilings??? 
The Eagles locker room looks like a store in the mall that hasn't updated since the 90's
The Bears locker room doesn't look like it's changed much since the 80's.
I'm not sure I understand the reason to put the logo on literally everything.

"don't worry guys all the chairs and all the trash cans and all the walls have the team logo on it in case you forget what team you play for and have to be reminded"
This made me realize how many team names start with either B or C.
Fucking album preview keeps flipping back to the guy vacuuming the Charger's floor...what the fuck. This is a cruel prank.
Anybody have pics of visiting locker rooms? Would be cool to compare them. 
LOL chargers
I bet the person who suggested the Jets locker room should look like the inside of an airplane is real pleased with himself
Buffalo has one awesome locker room.
UNL's College Locker Room makes some of these look a bit silly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnVDjX5apOM
Some of these are from stadium locker rooms and some are from practice facilities.
is that really what the lions locker room looks like?
Something that needs to be noted here and which hopefully won't be buried, that I learned when I took a tour of Heinz Field:

**Many NFL teams barely use their locker rooms.** Most of them, after all, have their true "clubhouse" elsewhere, at separate facilities where they train.  They literally are only going to be in that locker room on game day or for certain special events (when I went on the tour, it was shortly after the draft, so there was some equipment and stuff that had been set up for media and the new draftees for photo ops).

It was a stark contrast to how we couldn't even visit the Pirates clubhouse on the PNC Park tour, because it was baseball season and baseball players actually keep some of their stuff there. 
The Jaguars locker room is the best by far. I like the Giants too
Even the Browns' damn locker room is plain
Man, the 49ers, Giants and Jags all have amazing looking locker rooms.
jhghj
I saw Liverpool FC play AC Milan in Bank of America Stadium a couple summers ago. Coming from the locker rooms at Anfield to the Panthers' locker room must have been like going from an inflatable backyard kiddie pool to an Olympic-size indoor pool.
I don't see the Lions in any of the photos but the chargers looks brutal
Man that Chargers one sucks...
1- No, that is not the lions locker room.

2- Damn, that jags locker room is the best in football. Buffalo aint bad either. 
Where's the natural light coming from if that's the Giants locker room? Seems like a training facility to me.
Browns locker room looks like a crappy classroom
You can tell which of these teams  had success in the past few years and which haven't. 
Jags' one is fucking swish!

I like everything about that stadium.
I feel like having all those TVs in a locker room would be very distracting/annoying especially after a loss
The Chargers locker room looks like the silent floor of Cal Poly's library
Lions, Browns, Chargers, Raiders, and Titans look pretty generic/boring.  Lions are on a whole other level though.
Good: 49ers, Cowboys, Giants, Jags, Packers, Patriots  
Bad: Chargers and I was going to say Lions but apparently that is fake. 
Oregon and bama and im sure plenty of other schools have much nicer facilities. I cant decide if that is surprising or not.
JAGS JAGS JAGS JAGS JAGS

JAGS WIN THE LOCKER ROOM CONTEST

THEIR LOCKER ROOM HAS A GODDAMN HOT TUB AND LEATHER ROLLING CHAIRS FOR EVERYONE

WHEN I GROW UP, I WANT TO BE A JAGUAR

Jags, Giants, Packers, 49ers, Bills in that order.
A room for a collection of multimillionaires and half of them look like they are rocking TVs from 2003.
I might be a homer here, but New England's is pretty sweet being a big hallway. Reminds me of the giant room in Batman.
The Eagles photo doesn't do it justice. I've seen it in person, it's gorgeous.
I had no idea the Bills suited up at the airport.
Admit it, this post was just one giant troll to Detroit.  Gotta say though as a panthers fan, I approve :)
Matt Schaub in a boot :(
Sorry Browns fans... but it just looks so dull in there.
The fact that the niners locker room wasn't a dumpster fire tells me these pictures are fake.
Must hate the Lions
As a Panther fan and someone who went and had a work meeting at the Panthers locker room and meeting room, I'm glad to see when they updated the logo they kept the cheesy 90's "X's &amp; O's" on the carpet...

But picture doesn't do it justice it's very nice.
How does the Meadowlands work?

* Do the Giants and the Jets share a locker room?
* Are there three locker rooms (one for the giants, and one for the jets, and one for the visitors)?
* Does the home locker room of one team act as the visitor locker room for the other?
lions....
I love the Vikings one. It looks like an empty strip club. 
I'm really surprised by this. Even my old High Schools locker rooms were better than half of these, and I didn't even go to a fancy school
Theres a lot of college locker rooms that look on par if not better than these.
I've been in the cowboy's locker room. Shouldn't there be pictures of famous players on the walls above the lockers?
Do the Jaguars say "you can't fight in here, this is the war room!" because the resemblance is uncanny.

Also @ Bills:  dope af.  Keep rockin'.
I'm a little bit proud of the fact that the [Saint's locker room](https://i.imgur.com/a2B9Iud.jpg) looks like it's in a church basement. It seems fitting.
of course ours is a joke 
I am having a hard time believing that some of those chairs can hold the bigger guys lol. 
I bloody knew that the Jags room would be awesome!
http://i.imgur.com/sxxachD.gif
Either him being injured is the reason Gabbert is starting, or the 49ers are pulling something suspicious. I hope it's the former.

... Unless I missed some crucial info. 
Well grats to whatever team that gets him in the offseason. He isn't amazing, but he deserves a lot better than this season. 
Wow
When did he get injured?
[Surgery on Non-throwing shoulder apparently](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/668143438299197440)
Colin severely fucked himself with the contract he took.

If cut at the end of the year he'll have only earned $24,998,766 of a $114M contract. 
Fuck me, damn it, bye Kaepernick, I hope you tear it up on another team
Whoa. Is there any protocol to prove that the player is injured before putting him on IR? 
RG3 all over again. Poor dude needs to get out of SF
Get this guy outta there.

I still believe he can be a good QB.  

Idk where though
I didn't even know he was injured?
Colin "Kaepernick" is "out" with a "significant" "injury". He will be "placed" on "injured reserve" and miss the "remainder" of the "season".
Damn homie got RG3'd. I really don't know if it's Kaep's play that's the issue so much as the 49ers as a whole though. I guess time will tell.
Okay, dumb question: Didn't his contract have injury guarantees? Could the 49ers actually be fucking themselves over right now if the plan was to cut Kaep loose?

EDIT: On further review, it looks like that term is for "career-ending injury" which probably has a more specific meaning.
Signed a "126 Million" dollar contract a year and a half ago. Jesus.
This is suspicious. However, I'm not sure if anything's going to beat what the Jags did in 2012. Allow me to explain:

- In 2012, Blaine Gabbert started against the Houston Texans. He got injured on a play, and Chad Henne entered the game on the next drive. Gabbert was PROBABLE to return.

- Chad Henne threw a touchdown pass. Gabbert downgraded to QUESTIONABLE.

- Chad Henne threw his second touchdown pass. Gabbert downgraded to DOUBTFUL.

- Chad Henne threw his third touchdown pass. Gabbert downgraded to OUT.

- Even though the Jags lost the game, Henne threw for over 350 yards. The very next day, Gabbert was placed on IR.

How the Jags didn't get punished or looked at for that, I don't know. That was awfully suspicious.

I'm saying this because there is a precedent here (albeit, a shady one) to placing a guy on IR simply because the guy ahead of him played well. My guess is that Kaepernick would not be on IR if Gabbert stunk against Atlanta.
I remember Bill Barnwell [jokingly said](https://twitter.com/billbarnwell/status/661394740169060352) Kaepernick and RG3 will compete for the starting job in Philly next year and honestly at this point I wouldn't rule it out
This should immediately be followed up with the 49ers being penalized for not disclosing an injury right?
As a 49ers fan, I'm upset with this decision.

As a Kaepernick fan, I'm devastated.

Our first game this year, we ran the ball plenty &amp; Kap looked confident. 
Fast forward a few weeks and we're barely making any rushing yards and the O line is non-existent, Kap is forced into throwing it more from in the pocket and has no time but still scrapes by. He's looked like he was being forced to play differently, we should've let him play his way.

Our defence costs us a few games, Kap costs us 1 or 2. Kap gets benched (Gabbert threw 2 ints last week &amp; was nothing special, our D just held on) and now Kap's almost certainly on his way out.

The FO &amp; York are forcing him out because he was Harbaugh's Golden Child. It's a real shame and I'll be following him next year wherever he ends up.
doh geesus
I still think Kaepernick can be a good qb on a team that knows what he is and isn't and plays to his strengths rather than make him try to significantly improve his weaknesses
http://i.imgur.com/9T1kgIr.gif
What the fuck
If york's wormey brain sat and thought "how could I get rid of kap without having to take any responsibility, respond to controversy, or have to defend my choice like a man?" Tell me this isn't the first plan that comes to mind. Mystery injury, sent to IR.
I never thought another NFL owner could top Al Davis as a bigger nutcase, but Jed York is almost there.
Damn, rough couple of years for Kaep
Recently, I've had these "what the fuck happened?" moments like I just woke up from a coma that started right after the 2013 NFC championship game and now the Niners are terrible.  
  
I was looking forward to a vicious and dynamic rivalry with Seattle for the next several years, led by Wilson and Kaepernick.  
  
What the fuck happened?
In other news: Alex Smith has begun drinking heavily after discussions began around enacting the SF QB to KC rule.
well thats it for him as a 49er
Is he injured or "injured"?
"Colin Kaepernick told 49ers on Friday he wants to have surgery on his non-throwing shoulder, per source. Thus, IR. Thus, season over."
Well, the Niners already got on the Hayne Plane now it's time for the Blaine Plane. 
All in on the Blaine Train!
Gabbert and Thompson doesn't sound too good.  Thompson was underwhelming last year in his only year as a starter at South Carolina. Just didn't have the clutch gene.  
[deleted]
Wow. They gave us a right side of an offensive line that couldn't do jack shit if their lives depended on it and ultimately laid the problems of the team at Kap's feet. Fuck Jed York in the ass with a hot poker. Fuck Trent Balke and fuck their yes-man stooge Jim Tomsula. What a brutal fucking betrayal this is.

At least when we traded Montana after he recovered from back surgery we had the league MVP playing quarterback.
The year of the injured starting QB.
Schefter: "49ers being levied by a penalty from the NFL for not disclosing Kaepernick injury in practice reports. York has been stripped of team ownership, is appealing."

(In some alternate universe.)
How many picks you guys want from the Chiefs for him??
So they need another backup quarterback now, right? Who's left to sign?

Wait, Tebow. Him in the Bay area with this organization would be amazing.

Though seriously, who's still available?
Ouch. I can't help but think he is being sidelined intentionally. I'm not a fan of his, but that sucks royally if I'm right. 
The Blaine Train can't be stopped. 
Whaaaaat the fuuuuuck?
I still don't understand what has happened to the 49ers in the past two years. Yea Willis and j Smith retired. I suppose aldon Smith fiasco also had a major thing to  do with it... Suppose I answered my own question. 
Hes having surgery,  so everyone put their pitchforks down
First of all, does this mean Kaep gets all that tens of millions of dollars because he is technically "injured" now? Secondly, I wonder who will pick up to replace him... Who is even available?
That's what you get when you don't let a Ferrari be a Ferrari. You end up putting it in the shop until next Summer. 
I want to see this guy play for the Eagles. 
On a serious note, wouldn't he be perfect in Chip's system in Philly? Arm power, accuracy, and mobility? God that seems frightening. 
Seriously though, has any other team had this big of a fall from grace in the history of sports?
I'll say it: Harbaugh was the best coach in the NFL while he was with the Niners.

What he got out of Kap might not have been possible with any other coach in the NFL. 

What an incredible fall from grace. ^^^*knocks ^^^on ^^^wood
I feel like this might be so they don't have to pay him the bonuses... No way he comes back next year
IR after being benched and a bye week?  I thought QBs didn't take hits in practice.

Best of luck next season, Kap.  (Question is, with which team?)
Damn thats kinda shitty. That would suck if its something serious.  Hope he can wind up in a better situation if he goes elsewhere next season. 
The Texans, the Rams, and possibly the Jets depending on if they want Fitz for a long term solution. The 9ers are going full dumpster fire under York and an institution in this sport is being dismantled little by little. I hope he gets out and goes somewhere that can build him back up
Future Eagles QB Kaepernick placed on IR.
fuckin shit.
Didn't they bench him, not only because he was playing badly, but also because he had clauses in his contract that would guarantee pay if he got injured? 

If I'm remembering that correctly, then this is a hilarious middle finger to the front office
*sigh* 
[Pic of injury](http://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1768656.1397075291!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg)
7torms over :(
Kaepernick to go for a 2nd Bachelors degree and attend the University of Michigan to reunite with Harbaugh.
I've never seen a team poised to win a Super Bowl one season be totally dismantled like this the next season.
Fuck the entire Niners front office. They seriously ruined this team. Yes a lot of players retired or got suspended but they just fucked us.  
Whoa whoa whoa.  I miss one week of football and football news and this happens. . Wtf happened.???? 
I have a feeling the NFLPA is about to get involved in this
lmao everything going on with the 49ers is crazier than anyone could imagine. Rip to kaep as a 9er 
What???  I actually feel bad for 9ers fans.  I can't believe I just typed that.  Sorry boys.
Sad how the team ruined him. Hopefully another coach can fix him up 
"Injured"

*sigh*

what. the. fuck
Now the real American can lead the 49'ers to the Superbowl unimpeded
Had breakfast tacos, refreshed browser, Kap on IR. 
7even 7torm over. ;(
Damn. He's had a rough year.
Seriously? What the hell else can go wrong this season...
[Colin Kaepernick was probable for Sunday with a left shoulder injury. He was a full participant in practice this week.](https://twitter.com/Eric_Branch/status/668141607347032065)
what the fuck?
Niners are sneaky. They did this same thing to Kendal Hunter 
Wonder where he will end up next year
Jesus, I knew they were at odds, but I didn't know they were 'mystery ailment to the IR." bad terms. 
All I can say is....what the fuck? Dude was so much fun to watch. Can a 49er's fan please explain wtf is going on?!
might be the worst season in the 9ers' history
Niner's and Jed York probably gonna say he has a tummy ache and call it a ~~day~~ season.
I mean sucks for Kap but who honestly didn't expect this? Dude had plenty of time. Even before the mass exodus. Wish him the best of luck wherever he ends up
is this Kaep trying to get that injury guarenteed money?
I can see him going to Dallas and getting another shot once Romo is out.
I don't think he's an elite quarterback, but he's definitely better than average with decent coaching and deserves better than this year. Hopefully he lands in a spot that can bring out his potential 
I hate how York did him dirty man, that's fucked up.
Does that mean he's staying for next year? Or will he get kicked out at the end of the season?
Now the question is, what team is he on next year? 
Ok, we are willing to deal out Chase Daniel for a 2nd round pick. 
After the last few years I've really hated the niners but no team deserves this bullshit. Especially a franchise as storied as them.  I hope Kappernick goes somewhere else and fucks shit up.  
Doesn't matter, he'll be on the Eagles next year.
Kap Eagles jersey for me next season. 

Dan Snyder is 50. Jed York is only 35 years old.

#7ormsOver
Well, thanks for being a Niner, Kaep. Hopefully he will find a better home. 
This thread is the worst jumping to conclusions circle jerk I have ever seen. I never knew how much /r/nfl loved Kap until he got benched for Gabbert.
I heard he's getting surgery to install a chip into his shoulder. 
He's injured with a broken heart
Fuck, man. This is obvious York bullshit to kick him out and complete the season tank for a top pick. Kap deserves so much better considering what he's done for this team, and I really hope he's successful wherever he ends up next year. 

Fuck this season, man. Just... fuck 
What the fuck? 
Wow, all hail gabbert.
sigh
I bet he outclassed his competition in practice, and this was the only way to not be forced into starting him.
The 49ers are going to be my number 3 team next year after the Chiefs and whatever team gets Kaepernick.
The problem for him and RGIII isn't that they got screwed or injured.  The NFL got taken by surprise with these guys who were such good runners and decent pocket passers.  But defenses adjusted and running qbs aren't doing the same kind of damage they did before.  You have to be a great pocket passer regardless of how well you run.  Kap and RGIII just don't fit the bill.
this smells really bad. dammit niner organization. 
Go whichever team kap ends up on
Out with a torn ego. 
IR for what? Too many splinters in his ass from sitting on the bench?
I think getting benched for Gabbert injured his feelings.
Injury reported as Bruised Ego
wtf?
What even is
What?
Rick Smith IR for non-injured players?
The Blaine train cometh
I did not expect to hear this at all...
Non-throwing shoulder surgery.
Uh oh if he rehab lasts beyond April 1st his contract becomes guaranteed. 
Rams 2016 week 1 starter, Colin Kaepernick!
Did he fall off the bench or something?
... Your move Carroll?

Ah shit
Holy shit.  Why didn't they just trade him at the deadline?  I know that's easier said than done, but this is crazy.
This reminds me of Playmakers when the owner put the WR on IR even though he wasn't hurt.
The Chiefs will take him for 3 of our next first round draft picks and a conditional 7th round pick!
Broken heart.
Wat
Kind of a dick move, but if they want to move on from him I'd imagine it's a lot easier without him on the sidelines every week.
Was Kap's decision actually.
I guess we can't really laugh at the Niners. We could field a pretty OK team at IR except for special teams and QB. Sizzle, Pitta, Perriman, Taliaferro, Smitty, Zuttah, Campanaro. Matt Elam isn't good, but he's on IR too.
Oh boy. As an Eagles fan, I'm petrified. 
It was not that long ago that Alex Smith was forced out to make way for this guy... 
That early Black Friday special.
i would love to have him. Backup till romo is done.
Completely not opposed to see him in dallas idk 


Players can go on IR for being butt hurt?
*  He'd look good in an Eagles jersey.
*  We need a good backup
*  Our PR team can make silly ass videos about him and the ~~turtle~~ ~~tortoise~~ whatever
*  Mean Green and the turtle team rolls off the tongue

These are all valid and logical reasons.
The total collapse of the 49ers is complete. What a shit show jed has going on there. 
Must be some brutal hurt feelings
Something's fucky....

Either way, sometimes you gotsta cash out and get your $$$...but there's no way he didn't see the demise of the 49ers coming. They were already in the process of driving away anyone in the organization who was worth a damn when he took the contract.
[deleted]
Undisclosed injury? Sounds like rustled jimmies to me. 
how far he has fallen will be a 30 for 30 one day
Just in the Kaepernick of time.
Didn't realize you could get put on IR for being butt hurt.
For what? Hurt feelings?
I went on Thompson's Twitter because I have no idea who he is. Then I saw his wife, clicked on her name, and saw what was supposedly an aborted fetus. :/
Fuck your owner, 49ers. This season was so shit because he wants them to fail.
Must have gotten a serious burn from all of the bench warming he was doing.
That 7ucks.
this just eases the pain of him suiting up and looking like a douche on the sideline.
I'll always remember Kap as the only QB in our team's history to ever lose a SB.  I wish him well somewhere else, but I'm not sad to see him go.  I just hope our rebuild doesn't take another 10 years.  
Huh didnt he play a snap in the Atlanta game?
Can't even hate the 9ers anymore. What a poop season.
Did he hurt his pride?
Kaepernick must have really got his feelings hurt... 
Well his feelings are definitely hurt. 
Who knew hurt feelings could land you on IR. 
I guess "broken heart" is a pretty serious injury 
For what a shattered ego?
Who knew you could land on IR just from hurt feelings
7torm coming indeed
Jeez. Looks bad. Trainers are saying that if he doesn't sit out a few games then his ego might never recover.
Apparently, he sucked so bad it actually hurt...
I guess they scheduled the brain transplant.  Will they delay the coach's until the off season?
I remember before the season started someone here was defending the 49ers offense, telling all of us we are stupid, they'd be fine etc. 

How did that work out for ya?

Then someone right behind him defended the Seahawks offense.. 

oops.
[deleted]
RIP
Um, what did he injure? Besides his pride, feelings, reputation, and future?
How the mighty have fallen.
Injured pride,  perhaps
Bwahahhahahahahahahahhahahaha

"Cause fuck em thats why"
Not to say I told you so...BUT MOTHAFUCKER I KNEW IT.  I knew it since the day Harbaugh started Kaepernick over Smith.  Kaepernick quarterbacks are nice and shiny and new and fun, but they are not worth the risk with the speed that defenses have now.
Rons just covering the fact that our whole team is made up of robots.
TIL Rivera was on the 1985 Bears.  No clue how I managed to avoid not knowing that.
this is what kills me about professional sports. analyst want them to act like they're running for office.. they're literally playing a game. for our entertainment. relax.
I remember when I realized all this shit is just entertainment and really means nothing.  I had an existential crisis as a fan.  "You're rooting for laundry"
At this point I just want to see the Panthers do [this.](http://i.imgur.com/J9h3vqp.gifv)
People tend to forget that the average football player tends to be in their early to mid 20s, most are still "kids". They're going to act their age most of the time, get over it. 
I hate the full-corporate attitude where everyone has to act the same and say the same things and be 100% PC 100% of the time that the NFL seems to have adopted.

I liked the days of watching TO's/Calvin Johnson's shananigans.  Watching head coaches say things in press conferences you never see today (Jim Mora, Ditka and plenty of others).  

Now players get fined for anything, Carson Palmer is a good example of how ridiculous this mentality is.  It feels like players have to conform and not show any emotion whatsoever these days.
Thank you!! FFS, let the guys show a little personality on the field. Part of the reason I like Lynch so much is his celebrations. 

The handshake one always gets me. 
Are you sure about that Ron? I wouldn't be very surprised if Cam turned out to be a Cyborg, sent from the future, to kill ~~Sarah Connor~~  my hopes and dreams.
Even when Cam was dancing all over the Packers, I didn't care.  It's fun to watch someone have fun in this game.  I thought the exchange with Peppers was hilarious, too.
Hopefully this week Cam does something else to annoy the opposing teams fans so I can stop hearing about this.
Crazy how tons of people are up in arms about cams celebration, while when Rodgers celebrates, everyone loves it and he gets a commercial.
BUT THINK OF THE CHILDREN, RON!!
Something something Riverboat Ron Go For It.
But dancing like a robit is entertaining
Take it up with the NFL, they're the ones that hate fun.
I really liked it when the Packers used to bow to each other. So classy and cheesy. 
It's a dance not a dick, don't take it so hard.
[Ron Rivera on celebrating: DAB](https://vine.co/v/izMvJuUAhZE)
["I'm entertainment, I'm not a robot"](http://imgur.com/zIIlMkf)
Even that Fox robot never stopped celebrating.
*Panthers release LB Cleatus.*
I got cancer from the PFT comments.
Truth

They especially need to realize this in baseball too.
Confirmed rivera is a redditer
It seems so in to be hip and make fun of 'get off my lawn' guy.  I admit I'm not a big fan of the grandiose celebration stuff.  I also don't think it needs to be penalized.  It's just not fun to me personally.  The entertainment part only kicks in when the Titans LB gets mad or George Teague tackles TO on the star.  Not incidentally I'd rather have competitors of that ilk on my team than the Shaun Springs "ya I got no problem with him showing me up" guys.
Ron Rivera for president!
Man are people still talking about a guy celebrating a touchdown. Dumb, also I can out dance cam anyway 
I thought this season was Philip K. Dickian.
Ron please come back to San Diego we were wrong 
In the future there will be technology where VR Headsets put us to sleep and the software manipulates our dream states, so our consciousness can then be designed into a certain type of person, for example a football player.  So rather than concussion risk, we can spectate Dream Football games through fucking with our brain chemistry.

Cyborg football also sounds pretty cool.

Who can design the best robots?  No firearms though only a humanoid like body.
Whoever thinks Cam Newton celebrating is any sort of problem has clearly never played football, much less any sport, for that matter.
You don't want the other team celebrating?  Don't let them score 
He's right. I miss the old days. Team celebrations and St Louis doing Bob n weave. 
https://youtu.be/u5o8J7r72WU?t=37s
I don't have a problem with celebrating in the endzone. I love a good spike or a quick little victory dance. The thing I don't like is when it looks like the player's only motivation to score is so he could do a pre-planned celebration (T.O., anyone?). 
Remember when Panthers fans cried when Kaep did the superman thing? I do.
No wonder Cam can't turn off that smile.  He must be a robot
Well, obviously the whole team is robots. CAM is a computerized action machine or something. 
I really don't mind TD celebrations.  

Like some of T.O.'s celebrations, I think his was a bit excessive.

Most celebrations last a few seconds, and they move on.  The issue I have with Cam's celebration that sparked this discussion is that it went on for a LONG time.  Then, he started it up again when a defeneder came near.  Personally, I think it should have drawn a taunting penalty.  That's the issue I had with the celebration.  It crossed the line between fun into directly taunting someone...in a second unnecessary celebration.

White America is so saddened by Cam Newton. Dab on them folk
What about celebrating for the purpose of antagonizing the other team?
And here i thought it was a sport not clowns.
Says perhaps the most robotic coach in the NFL... regardless, Cam is cool, so let him do what he wants dammit. 
Sports Entertainment? So the only way he can win games is if they are scripted? Sounds about right.
Did somebody say QB Controversy? Hoyer vs Weeden, round 2.
Texans are getting the gang back together!
Alfred Blue is about to lead the league in receptions, watch out.
Well, I guess I know who's starting on Sunday.

At least we got our 1st round QB, finally!
Houston: the Browns QB graveyard.
[Umm....](http://media.giphy.com/media/3mKkBUSQRrMME/giphy.gif)
Lol the struggle to find a franchise qb. Makes you appreciate the one you have so much more.
UGH
I wonder how Weeden feels about this. He doesn't have to move far, but he knows that as soon as Hoyer comes back from his concussion, he'll be cut again.
The Texans QB situation has pretty much just boiled down to "Why not?"
http://i.imgur.com/YcAQlkx.gif
I've got tickets to the game on Sunday.  First time I'm getting to see the Jets since I've moved to Texas.  And I may get Smith vs Yates?


Rick Smith misinterprets recent weed decriminalization ordinance in Houston.
You know you're struggling at QB when you have two ex-browns at QB.
Someone honey dicked Rick Smith. 
Is there really nobody better out there?
Probably just the backup for Yates until Hoyer is healthy
He was just wandering aimlessly around the airport in Dallas, and somehow ended up stumbling all the way to Houston.  Get that guy the fuck out of the state already.

FTFY
i dont understand the hate for weeden from dallas fans. how many games has cassell won?
Dear Texans, 

Do whatever you can to not make him start
Maybe if they're lucky we'll let them have Matt Cassel next.

How did you approve Weeden over the SEX CANNON?!?!?!

#EVERYTHING'S DEEPER IN REXAS.
The bottom of the barrel is scraped clean.
I'm so so sorry Texans fans.  Even after 7 straight loses the Cowboys still found a way to shit on you.

Can we... not?
this post's title sounds so fatal, like he's been claimed by the sea
Imagine if Weeden plays in the playoffs and the Cowboys don't.
FIRE RICK SMITH 
Vomit
hahaha
Hoyer's not gonna play this week, is he?
He doesn't even need to get new license plats for his car.
LOL
[Texans fans be like](http://i.imgur.com/ABWMf2h.jpg)
Looks like the Texans have finally found their QB of the future. Oh wait, Weeden's HOW old?!
CUT TJ YATES AND NEVER LET HIM PLAY IN THE LEAGUE AGAIN FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
One mans trash is another man trash. Welcome to the NFL were going green and recycling trash is the name of the game.
Oh, the hell of not having a decent Qb, it's horrible. 
Sigh.
Fucking why?
Dark days.
Good luck Brandon
Texans can fucking have him hahaha we got Romo back!! Our season is still over..
Talk about being on the upswing... Texans beat the undefeated Bengals and signed Weeden this week. 
When was the last time a Quarterback started for two different 1st place teams in the same season?
Lol I bet some Texan fan said "well at least it can't get any worse..."
I say this fully aware of my bias. Gig'em Aggies. 

On a second thought- I think JJ may be aware that picking a QB from Texas, A&amp;M, Oklahoma, OK State, or any other big school in the region would polarize a part of the fan base and could affect the franchise commercially. Hence why he's staying away from guys like RGIII and Johnny Football.
Texans = AFC South champs confirmed?
Do we even need to say anything? 
houston trying at qb? im confused.
Both these kids can play all they need is a chance! 
Why does everyone shit on Weeden so much? They made him throw a bunch of short passes and the receivers were dropping the ball.
HAHAHA... oh wait... we suck to.
Does anyone else think that the Texans picked up Weeden at least partially because his travel expenses would be minimal?
In other news, the Texans have also called dibs on johnny manziel once the Browns are done with him
He really wasnt that bad with the Cowboys for a backup.  They were just impatient and the switch didnt work out any better for them.  Glad Weeden found work
Texans continue the tradition of cowboys sloppy seconds. 
"The circle is now complete."
THE BEGINNING OF AN ERA!
a new era 
http://i.imgur.com/f6due.gifv
Might as well kick the tires. I expect Houston to draft a quarterback this spring, but since they stand a legitimate shot at winning the AFCS they might as well try to get the best quarterback they can muster. 
Oh god please no
He's all yours
One era ends, another begins.
I'm so sorry 
Good luck boys 
I LOVE this!!
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
The Cleveland Texans
He honestly didn't play THAT bad for Dallas, considering their lack of a deep threat when Dez was out. That being said, I don't see him doing any better in Houston.
wow...you know you're desperate when
As a proud 1 week old owner of Blain Gabbert; no judgement.
Must be a shortage on QBs lol
Must be a lot of soggy noodles at the bottom of fridge.
And the circus continues, called this at the beginning of the season.
please god no why

Tebow!
hooray for bad decisions?
If this doesn't work out they intend to either sign Colt McCoy or bring Brady Quin out of retirement.

Wonder how much they'd trade for Johnny Manziel...
On purpose?
It would only make sense that he goes off for the Texans. 
Oh shit they are back together. What a travesty 
Whar Tebow?


YOU CANT WEED OUT THE WEEDEN
Nobody scrambling to pick up Pickles?
Seems like such a waste. I'm sure there are better qbs available.
He's untackleable.... unless you have a large American flag...
I fucking love this division.
This move makes zero sense for the Cowboys. We started looking up some stuff when we were talking about it at work. 

Weekend has a much better passer rating this year than Cassel, his completion percentage is higher, Weeden was playing without Dez Bryant. So Weeden put up better numbers with worse talent around him. In addition, Weeden is younger, he's been on the team longer and so presumably knows the system and the guys better than Cassel does. Additionally because he's both younger and because he played baseball instead of football straight out of college he's got significantly more miles left in his body than Cassel probably does.  In other words what we determined is that by every single pertinent metric except for overall starting record Weeden is the better guy.  


Now here's the thing about their records. Almost all of Weedens starts came when he was with the Browns during some of their shittiest seasons. Cassels came largely from his time with the Chiefs when they were mediocre and the season he filled in extensively for an injured Tom Brady in New England when the pats were *REALLY* fuckin' good. So the one metric that Cassel has a lead on almost doesn't matter because how much of that is related more to the team they're on than the guy playing QB for that team?



But then I found the single most damning piece of evidence that should prove to any logical person that this is a stupid move. Romo comes back this week. Now the situation for the Cowboys is that they basically have to win out. So they're *going* to play Romo. so it doesn't really matter who else you have because you're going to play Romo. So you have to look at the benefits of keeping or letting go of each guy. 



Cassel is on a 1 year $2.2 million deal with about $2m if he hits certain incentives. 


Brandon Weeden was on a $615k deal for this year and he'd be an unrestricted free agent. 



So both guys are gone after this year... Or you pay them to stay. Neither guy has any guaranteed money or bonuses. So you're definetly taking a financial hit keeping Cassel instead of Weeden and Weeden may have been the better QB anyway so it really highlights what's wrong with Cowboys in general. You've got one guy with a mediclocre record fighting to be a backup with another guy who is cheaper and probably better and last but not least of Romo dies get hurt and Cassel comes in and actually plays well ebough to win out then there's a possibility he makes his incentives then you could owe him $2m. And the likelihood of making the playoff even with Romo back is low enough that the contract SHOULD be the most important factor. And that is overwhelmingly favoring Weedon.  


The whole thing just blows my mind. Why keep a guy playing as a backup for more money than another backup who's been on the team longer and is currently putting up the better stat line?
Good luck. Brandon Weeden always finds a way to play.
Christ, when you're collecting Browns' QB cast-offs you know you're in trouble.

What's Brady Quinn up to these days?
Maybe he can be on time.
At least he doesn't have to move far
For what purpose?
I didn't know he was released by the Cowboys.  I mean, Jerry was talking like this guy was as good as any other QB in the league after week 2.
To be fair, the man is one of the purest passers of our generation. 
Relevant? 

http://imgur.com/sWdYIg3 
Weeden Boys!!!
if he gets them a win I'll shit myself.

Tactical signing. They just want him for scouting intel for when the Texans play the Cowboys in the Super Bowl.
God Weeden was terrible. I was glad the Cowboys made a change. The guy was too scared to throw the ball over 10 yards and for good reason. Every time he did was an interception. Good riddance. Have fun Texans. 
Probably to keep the Colts from claiming him.
Keepin' the Weeden in Texas.
Deepest QB depth in the NFL
Texans about to get high on Weed-en
Did they not watch any of our games?
Oh. God. Nononono why why why fuck Rick Smith 
Houston's not going to let Hoyer's injury stop them from losing!
damn, I really thought Philly would sign him
This is actually pretty hilarious.
hahahahahaha.

Well, I mean, we needed to have someone backing up...TJ Yates. But aw, this makes me sad about Hoyer. Hope he gets better soon. We are Browns South.
Weeden wasn't half bad with the Cowboys this year. Definitely didn't have the defensive help that Cassel had. He's not a bad #2 or #3.
The fuck for man? Yates made my Bengals lie down and purr.
Do the Texans have any self respect?
I hope Weeden was awake when he got that call. Wouldn't want be late...
Texans..no..take peyton instead.
As an avid Houston Hater: 

Things are going very, very well for me.
Man, I would love to be a below average NFL quarterback. For some reason people keep paying Weeden even though it's clear he isn't a good football player.
As a new fan of NFL, what's this guy's story? Who all the Texans fans are going "noooo"?

Not good for Hoyer I'm assuming.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

He's your problem now
He would've gotten away with it too, if it weren't for them meddling Browns and the 40 seconds it took them to figure out he was lying.
"Oh c'mon, that video's so old!"

*in video* "Hey man, how fucked up was that Paris attack?"

*nohmygod*
Where was his fall guy?
If true, that is worthy of a 3rd string demotion. Honestly, the issue with the video/partying was not really because he was doing it but because he lied about it. He told the team that he wouldn't do anything stupid and go out and he does it anyways. He is also a few months removed from rehab.

Circumstance is the reason why things have transpired the way they have.

Matt Prater was suspended for drinking due to the fact that he was in a program.


Eh, he's just a kid, let him be a kid. Right? /s

Dude deserves to be benched. He doesn't understand how to be a professional. He doesn't care. He'd rather party.
So did he said the video was old and he lied about it being old?
See, for the "He's just a 22 year old kid partying!" crowd, this is the problem.  Not only is he out partying when the Browns probably told him not to, he's going a step further and lying about it, being immature, etc.  Can't expect that out of your franchise QB.
Browns fans still want Pettine fired?

It seems apparent that Pettine had no option other than to bench Johnny.
Dude told you what he was in college. 
Nobody should be surprised. He doesn't take the responsibility seriously,  and he has a safety net to fall back on. 
Running tally of Browns/Manziel fans excuses for him partying/drinking over the weekend...

* The video is old, the DJ just tweeted it was old.  Fucking media making shit out of nothing

* Maybe going to rehab was just a PR move and drinking isnt that big of a deal

* Maybe he went to rehab for drugs and not alcohol so drinking isnt a big deal

* He should be allowed to do whatever he wants on his bye week, no employer should dictate to their employees what to do on their days off

* He never said he would stop drinking, he just said he'd stop being a distraction to the team.  The only people who are making this a distraction is the media

* Anecdotal... I went to rehab for alcohol, and I still go out occasionally and drink.. maybe he can handle his liquor

* He should be judged on his on-field performance only, not what he does in his own time

&amp;nbsp;

So what are the excuses for lying to your boss and inducing others to lie on your behalf?


The cover up only makes it worse, kid. 
~~Tim Couch~~

~~Brandon Weeden~~

~~Johnny Manziel~~

~~Brady Quinn~~

20th time's a charm, right?
Johnny Manziel's brilliant long con to leave the Browns is almost complete.
Where the Johnny fanboys at now? Maybe Pettine was right to sit the guy
Guy's a fucking idiot who is throwing away a golden chance in life. No one to blame but Johnny. 
But he deserves to be young and have fun!! Other players don't get this kind of judgment. Despite the fact Johnny has alcohol/partying issues and was in rehab. Context doesn't matter!!

Where are the defenders now? He deserved the demotion. He was playing in the most coveted sports position in the fucking NFL and blew it to party. He got a million chances and blew it. He deserved this. Browns did the right thing.
Like I've said from day one. Manziel is the phoniest guy I've ever seen. I didn't believe for once second that he would stay clean. He's the definition of 'arrogant douchebag'. 
Man I wonder if he is doing all this to get out of Cleveland. Because there's no fucking way he's that dumb 
You'll be a cowboy soon enough, Manziel. Then, I can cry myself to sleep. 
Manziel is so damn stupid 
Dennis the Manziel.
He neeeeeeeds to stop hanging with people that film him.
FIRE PETTINE /s
This beyond anything else will prevent him from getting signed by another team. He is displaying actions similar to an addict. He likely needs rehab again and cannot ever casually drink
This guy is a total shit show and I wish he would just go away.  Tired of seeing his drama everywhere.  He is the epitome of a spoiled brat who thinks he can do whatever he wants and get away with it.  
"Come get me at number 22 and you won't regret it. I want to WRECK THIS LEAGUE WITH YOU!"  This isn't the first time he lied to the Browns...  
All aboard the Lynch train

Edit: PAXTON LYNCH!! Jesus 
I bet McCown took the video
If he only threw 5tds in each of his starts this  wouldn't be an issue 
He's lucky he wasn't cut. He probably should have been. 
Oh Johnny
It's a shame he can't get his shit together. A good Johnny Manziel would be great for the league. 
As someone that goes to outpatient stuff for drug addiction, you got to cut this kid the lack of accountability is sickening. 
That explains the demotion. Hopefully this shuts up the people defending him and complaining about it. 
 #ryanleaf
I had given Manziel the benefit of the doubt before this, but now that this info is out... fucking hell Johnny. Why? 
Partying and drinking for a guy that has had issues with these things, and who has been through rehab and all that is really not good at all. It suggests the problems haven't gone anywhere and he isn't in control of the situation.

Lying and getting others to lie? Well thats just unacceptable and shows he is nowhere he needs to be as a person and certainly not as a leader.

Can't say I didn't see this coming. It was sad to watch everyone think him going to rehab was the end of the problems and that it was gonna be smooth sailing from then out... so many of the top rated posts around here over the past months are always citing that he did what he had to do by going to rehab and now he deserves the benefit of the doubt, or whatever. I admire the hope, but that is a reaction of someone who has never had to deal with someone with a substance abuse problem. Rehab isn't the end... its the start of a long fight. Rehab is easy. Being a millionaire football player with a substance abuse problem is the hard part. 

I'm certainly not hating on the guy, I just think these kind of expectations only lead to disappointment as well as putting extra pressure on a guy who has enough to deal with. 
I feel so bad for the Browns...they should never have drafted this kid, but damn, he is just such a train wreck.
Next years Dallas Cowboys #2 qb! Book it!
I don't think Manziel realized he got a professional job, dude obviously thinks he's still in college

Looks like Jerry Jones may get Johnny after all 
Fuck fuck fuck. Here comes another qb pick in the draft. More fail. 
Insert video of that Browns fan going off about having Johnny Football on the bench and not playing him here.

Yeah don't lie to your coaches. They don't like that.
I've been a strong defender of Manziel. But this I can't defend. This is just low. 

Maybe if he was a starter like Jameis was, he wouldn't be in this position. That doesn't matter now. He's in this position and it's not looking good. Can't have someone like that on your team.
"But Johnny did nothing wrong! This is America! He's over 21! He can drink if he wants!" How about wait until some of the details become clear before making snap reactions folks. 
I'm done with this idiot. Please get him the fuck off my team.

Manziel is a rich yuppie in a league where most of the players grew up with nothing but dreams.  Johnny has money and fame already.  

Even after he is out of the NFL he is still going to have money, and I could totally see him getting a reality show.

Fact is, he is not hungry enough to be a great player.
Remember when that fucktard Skip Bayless was screaming about this kid and how he was going to be a star, when it turns out he's nothing but a gigantic, entitled shit.  He doesn't have the mindset to take this job seriously.
He's done in the NFL I think. Waste of potential. 
##Johnny, you are an idiot. 
Welp, RIP his Browns career
Is it possible to just purge the team and start over? I feel like we'd be in better shape if we could do that.
Damn what a clown
Did he go to rehab for alcohol or something else btw?
Johnny Done-With-Football
Bro.
This league makes no damn sense. Lie about a video, bench. Beat the hell out of your wife, you get a 2nd chance. 


Blue color fan base mentally exhausted with 16 years of losing. Affluenza-stricken 1st round draft pick QB who doesn't get responsibility or how old Browns fans want someone like Bernie who bleeds for Cleveland. I just want to win and stop being the butt of everyone's NFL joke.
One would think he would've learned by now that he can't do this shit, especially after having to go to rehab.

Can't trust him. He has been given so many chances and he keeps doing this.
I'm so sick of this moron, he's not taking anyone to a winning season, cut his ass
InebriateGate
I was holding it for a friend!
"Well the Lions got big problems. Lets talk abiut Brett now"
Dallas needs a qb, johnny needs a team....
I'm reminded of Ballers when Ricky Jordan fucked up one too many times and the Packers board just said "Cut him." after his pleading for forgiveness one last time.
I really think he's just trying to tank his way out of Cleveland.  Like he's just begging them to dump him to some team for a protected 2019 7th rounder.  

It might just end up working.
Show me the monnneeyyy
And there a people who want this guy is Dallas...
Let him do what he wants to do hes a grown man , let him make decisions for himself he made a choise went to rehab and decided that he wants to drink it was his week off . Fuck you browns i would drink too if i played for your team
There are people that honestly believe there aren't QB deprived teams that would jump at signing him this offseason.

I mean, just look at how bad Jerry is itching to replace Romo after yesterday.
http://deadspin.com/the-long-con-how-the-manziels-conquered-america-1040593220 I know its been posted many time before, but I seriously encourage you to read about Manziels faily history..
That's actually very sad 
Wow where are the apologists calling for the coaches head now? Almost crazy the difference between the top comments in this thread vs the last one
Ryan Leaf 2.0. I said it when the guy was drafted. 
I believed in him, I honestly thought he had changed. Very disappointing

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OZJKBoDrGlA
As much as I want this kid to succeed, he's shitting away opportunity after opportunity. 
Sad to see this kid throwing away his career for something so dumb.

Some people just peak in college.
cut him. He obviously isn't willing to commit to the team.
I understand he's supposed to be a professional and that he promised he'd stay on track, but fuck I can't blame the 22 year old for doing 22 year old things
Everyone lies to their coach's face and treats their rehab like a joke,  stop being so jealous FUN POLICE
And here I thought his biggest issues were going be translating his college game to the pros. Turns out he's just an immature little snot.
I'm getting sick of the Johnny Football merry-go-round. He consistently chooses partying over being a responsible player for the franchise, and his coach has had enough of it. Maybe some other team will give him a chance in the future, I can see why the Browns have had enough of him.
any link to this video? and the others? I'm a terrible you tube searcher apparently. 
This kid is gonna go and get himself cut and nobody will want to pick him up due to the distraction.

And if he doesn't do it, the media will do it for him.
Where are all the Manzel dick riders now? 
Heh, we dodged a big ass bullet here. Sorry Browns.
I'm out of the loop here, wtf happened? 
Manziel for Griffin what's the worst that can happen
They asked him to lay low and he didn't and then lied about it. Should consider himself lucky to still be on the team.
You almost redeemed yourself!! Damnit, Johnny Cokefiend!
Huh.

Well that settles it, sorry Browns.
It's like he wants to get cut
Release him immediately. 
He's not a very bright kid. 
I'll never know why any team drafted him. It was obvious in his college days that he was immature and unprepared. 
Anyone else feel kinda bad for the kid? Yeah, he's douchey and looks like a date rapist, but he seems like he's self destructive and his story won't end well. 
And I was an asshole for claiming his rehab was a PR stunt.
He fucked up in lying. I don't really care that he likes to  drink, but just be honest with the coaches about it..This is the cellphone era everything is recorded. 
Why do people think that rehab means abstinence only from that point on?

Are sex addicts never allowed to have sex again?

Rehab is about removing codependence from your addicition, abstienence is one way of going about it, but not the only way


Johnny lying about this was bad, but there's no issue with him drinking responsibly. He didn't miss any meetings or practices and he was even back in time to do volunteer work
Lol guys like 23 years old and is doing shit I did when I was 16. Grow the fuck up bro
He doesn't deserve to start after this revelation. Insert him as starter for the final month of games and see what he can do. Showcase him to potential trade partners in hopes that someone trades for him in the offseason.

Johnny's shown that he is not willing to fulfill the responsibilities on and off the field of a professional quarterback. Maybe he turns things around in Texas but right now he looks like a bust and his actions over the past week reinforce my statement.
I thank God every day we didn't end up with this goddamned clown in the draft.

I'm a very nonjudgemental person and I recognize that people make mistakes, especially when they're young, but I knew that Manziel was bad news from jump street. The kid is just a little shit and he's utterly irresponsible. What's worse, he doesn't even own up to his mistakes. I can't stand manipulative people who bullshit like Manziel does. 

I hope to God that nobody tries to defend him anymore, because this kid is a shit. 
What if he and Jerry Jones already have an agreement and hes just doing this to get cut so the Cowboys can pick him up? I really dont think this is that far fetched, better that than completely die in the Browns via looking like a terrible QB because you offense makes you look like it, or risk an injury in the shittiest team (no offense Browns, but it is what it is and Pettine should go)
I've said it in god knows how many threads now, but the NFL is a meritocracy.  If he's capable of becoming a franchise QB and this is the shit he's being benched for when AP and Hardy still get to play, then we don't fucking deserve one.  If we let him go and he becomes some other clubs' franchise QB, then we really, *really* are going to look like fucking braindead assholes no matter what seemed right at the time.

We should not even be concerned at all what the kid does when he's not on the clock unless he's out committing felonies.  And this would be my argument regardless of what team I followed.
The Browns have been lying about being an actual NFL team for a while now. They shouldn't be so mad at Johnny 
Browns if you want to stop being a joke, stick to one guy ffs.   If he's not getting suspended then there's no reason to bench, him.   If he wants act like a dumb man-child then let him and if it starts to affect his play or his availability to play then replace him.     It's a business after all
Well Browns, looks like it's 'next, new QB drafted next year, man up'
Who cares
I really want to believe he's just trying to force Cleveland to let him go, to somewhere else. He's a hot headed QB with obvious talent that he's been displaying this season, and I could see someone with a big ego not wanting to play for such a depressing team.  I get the benching now with the added context, but I'm still pulling for Manziel to find success.

Dude just has shitty people around him. How did that video even get taken? I work for a club and the week before the super bowl a high profile running back came in to party and nobody heard about it. No tweets, no instagram posts. He came in with a mask on too lol. 

Let's say it was Gronk partying on his bye week no one would care but he actually produces on Sundays. Johnny needs to get his shit together.
Jesus fuck I defended him for drinking but completely going against your word to the team is fucked up. Johnny stop being a fuckup so I can like you.
If true its worthy of being cut honestly. He's so unprofessional that he's never gonna be a guy you want to be in a position of leadership, period. He's done. 
Next summer, attend Kap and Johnny's QB Camp!
Not a shock, his dad said before the draft he feared Johnny was an alcoholic. 
Jerry Jones is probably on the phone right now trying to get him.
1 Paxton Lynch, please.  
Say it ain't so, Johnny?
I really want to pull for the kid, but he's a fucking retard 
What a fucking dumpster fire. 
This whole situation is fucking weird, fuck what johnny does off the field man if he sucks then bench him. He is a really dumb kid if he thinks he can keep getting away with this tho. I hope he gets a chance to mature before his career is ended by this shit.
Now, the 3rd string demotion makes even more sense. Guy is gonna go down like Mallet.
Man-child of the highest order.
If there is one constant on this earth that I can always put my money on, it's the Browns sucking.
I think a grown ass man, should be allowed to have a couple drinks on his own time....nfl player or not. However, if Manziel was in rehab for that long...he is fighting some demons.

Young, rich and famous Hes going to party his ass off. 
Browns will still be the Browns.. manziel will probably have an awesome life regardless
So much drama over such a mediocre player. Teblow or Michael Sam anyone?
Yeah, we were SOOOO stupid for taking Bridgewater over him... lol
[deleted]
Definitely shouldn't have lied however even so it's not a huge deal. Fine him? Yes. Don't throw him away tho over this. Not to mention the video isn't even bad. He's had some off field issues but it's not like there bad he just parties and everyone hate him for it. Definitely needs to focus on football but it's not big if he wants to blow off steam and have legal fun, he's not breaking the law by partying. I just think people over react, you can't expect players to be 100 percent focused on football every single day they have lives too. If that's the case then we should all be criticized for not thinking about bagging groceries or installing cable or doing whatever it is every second of every day trying to better ourselves. Not a Browns fan, not even a Manziel fan just think he gets a lot of criticism, some earned but others no way.

Shouldn't have lied though, this shouldn't be as big of a deal that it is.
Someone could rush onto the field, light him on fire, and everyone could just watch him burn alive, and I would simply think, "I'm not even upset."
If cell phone videos were a thing when Marino played or Irvin. Johnny seems to do a lot right and some wrong.  He's young and human.  Frankly, dipshits who video this stuff and put it on the Internet are the problem. 
I hate to be that guy, but I don't see a situation where if a black QB behaved the way Manziel does he would be getting a free pass. 
I really could not care less. Let the kid play.

No one cares. Teammates don't care. Fans don't care. Only people that care are the coaches. Get over it.
[deleted]
Someone snitched.
Please cut him and get the man out of Cleveland and to a team where he can have success.
That's messed up. Even for the browns organization.
Maybe only giving Lamar Miller 8 touches in a game isn't the best thing for job security 
IMA FIRIN MAH LAZOR
[You know what this means...](http://imgur.com/GhZFYQV)

^^^please
As he should be.

How do you only give Miller the ball FIVE times.

ESPN said something like "The Dolphins are winless in the six games Miller has had fewer than 12 carries this season."

Give the ball to your talented RB...
Patriots lose and Bill Lazor is fired in a span of 12 hours?

Christmas came early!
Maybe run it more than 9 times per game you fucking idiot.
It seems the Dolphins really don't like losing to the Jets. 


&gt;Dolphins QB coach Zac Taylor is Miami's new offensive coordinator

https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/671330874495885312
Yo Miami if you need someone else fired you know who to call 
Sources say they are upgrading to the newer model: Major Lazor.
Always happens after the Jets
FREE LAMAR
The dumpster fire burns slightly less this morning. 

No more Bill "Why run when you can throw" Lazor. Hopefully fins get way more balanced now.
[Rest in Peace](http://img11.deviantart.net/793e/i/2011/280/9/7/cyborg_dolphin_with_laser_eyes_by_harpo_exe-d4c48n1.png)
Come back home
YES YES YES YES

Lazor was a solid experiment considering what he did with Foles, but he was CLEARLY not ready to be calling plays for us.

Glad to see action get taken and not waiting till the offseason.
Miami has now and interim HC, DC, OC. Is that an NFL first?
That Texans stomp out was the worst thing to happen to you guys and the best thing to happen to us. Since that game we have went on to win four straight and they have lost four out of their last five games and fire their offensive coordinator.  Funny how life works out. 
I'm pleasantly surprised by the lack of 'FIRE THA LAZOR' comments in this thread
I did not know they had an oc.
Keep your hands off my Cooter!
Thanks jets? ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


That's a cool name though
Can Davante Parker get more playing time now? It's not like we need a 6"4 redzone threat
Baby come back
Come to Butthead
I wish this was about kyle shanahan
Coach Z: Where my Lazors at?
Are they sure that's wise, firing someone with that name? This just SCREAMS supervillain origin story...
Us next please. 
His refusal to get Lamar Miller the ball was mind boggling. Don't know why he wasn't just fired along with Philbin and Coyle
Me next! Me next!
Once again, WHY DIDNT WE DO ALL THIS AT THE END OF LAST SEASON? WHY DID ROSS LET HARBAUGH WALK TO MICHIGAN? WHY DID WE NOT GOT AFTER TODD BOWLES KNOWING HES A SOLID COACH BECAUSE HE FUCKING WORKED FOR US? 

Could have saved a lot of heartache by firing them last season and using the entire off season to build a new system that compliments the skills of our offense and defense and works around the weakness of both. 
Another Jets blowout resulting in a member of the Dolphins coaching staff being fired. 
The Dolphins pass so often, they were bound to fire a Lazor eventually.
He wasn't PC enough.
Some say he was too focused...
Too late. He should've been gone with Philbin and Coyle. Now, we just wasted time, talent and gave campbell no chance to success. 

Only good point is next coach will build all his staff, so no excuses... (yay,  rebuilding year)... 
Dolphins front office all have Lamar Miller on their fantasy teams and are sick of Lazor's not running the ball 
His brother is a super gay Spanish teacher at my high school. Se√±or Lazor.
I dont see what the hell else they have to lose at this point. Let Tannehill audible, scramble, drop his pants and shit right on the field, whatever he wants... play Paker and air this shit out. See what you have.
Can someone explain why the interim HC doesn't do something about Lazor's bad O calling? Isn't he looking to keep his job as an HC? I don't get why he is not overruling these consistently bad pass plays and not calling for Miller more often.
He doesn't need to be in the league.
I mean... ok, but wasn't I just applauding him and complaining about how lazor was being stifled by philbin 2 months ago
Dolphins reach out to Chip Kelly for OC spot.  I'm just waiting for that to pop up on ESPN. 
Dolphins QB coach is the interim OC now.

Trying to pull a Cooter eh there Dolphins
[Miami now in full celebration mode](https://media3.giphy.com/media/yidUzqXC95Scfw9P1u/giphy.gif)
And there was much rejoicing in the Lamar Miller household
Finally. He abandoned the run way too early. I'm excited to see who will become our new coaches after this season :)
As a UVA fan, I can tell you, getting rid of Bill Lazor is always good. 
he was probably out when they hired a new hc anyway.

i'd like to see him come back as the qb coach in philly, foles seemed to have benefited from working with him.
Oline was an unmitigated disaster. This won't fix that.
Now we just have to fire the rest of the coaching staff and the front office.
LSU could use an experienced QB coach! 
what's the point of firing an offensive coordinator, when you're going to be hiring a head coach in a few weeks, who'll likely bring in his own OC?

Unless, they're planning on promoting Dan Campbell to the permanent position.
Fucking goood. Maybe now they'll remember they have a good runningback that can run the ball from time to time.
Thank god. Lamar Miller is being criminally underused. As soon as they went down 7 this weekend they completely abandoned the run. Its not like the pass was working either, Ryan Tannehill can't shoulder the whole team.

Things are looking way better for them now, anyone should be an improvement to Lazor. And DeVante started making some plays this week too, so if Lamar gets the ball and DeVante proves he is a stud the Dolphins should start having some success.
Thank God we did this before he got Landry killed. We've probably already shortened his career 2 or 3 years with the 15 asinine plays over the middle and WR screens he has to play through every game.
fucking fire everyone, this team is such a dumpster fire it is a joke
Omg Bill coach our QBs plsssss
YESYESYESYES
While we're on the subject of firing coordinators named Bill... Looking at you, Davis.
I remember Dolphins fans being hype for him, too.
"Let me introduce you to Blade, Lazor, Blazer..."  
  
-Dolphins GM introducing coaching staff pre-season
  
"We just fired Lazor.  Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.  NOBODY!!!"  
  
-Dolphins GM yesterday
"per source" is the journalistic version of "I heard it from a guy"
Shanahan is available Dolphin bros...take him! (please?)
Does this mean Lamar Miller gets carries now?
We'll still fuck it up in the draft. #jaded

At least he can join the Globo-Gym dodgeball team.
So, uh... do you want Kyle Shananhan?
he didn't have a leg to stand on
Yes. The 2 times we put Ajayi and Miller in the backfield together, they were unstoppable. He never did it again after the Philly game. Glad he's gone. 
12 yards rushing
[Fire Everything!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Io0OQ2zPS4)
Lazor arguably deserved to be fired, but why now?  What does firing your OC with five games left in the season accomplish?  All it does is cultivate an appearance of organizational instability, where coaches are constantly promoted and fired throughout the season.
"IMA FIRIN MAH LAZOR!!!" - Dolphins Front Office 

But you're still gonna pass to Jarvis Landry, right?... Right?
He's been zapped!
ITT: Shoop da Whoop
Next UVA head coach. Calling it now.
Miami Dolphins head coach: "IMMA FIRIN' MA LAZOR!"
Pew pew ... ^pew? :(
Would you mind taking Bevell off our hands? It'd be an upgrade...
FIRE THA LAZOR!!!!!!!!! 
Yay! Another Miami coach firing; it's Miller Time!
Obligatory fira teh Lazor for the billionth time this season.
Fire the "Lazor"!
I guess you could say he was "Firin ma Lazor!"
I guessed the dolphins have. *puts on sunglasses*. Fired their Lazor. 

YEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Dolphins cleaned the staff out this year. 
I would love seeing him come in as an assistant OC for the Vikes. I know it's unlikely, but it would be great to see some new-age thinking infused into Norv's system.
They have a lot of offensive talent, hopefully a new OC can jumpstart that offense. I wonder how this will impact Lamar Miller being signed/not signed in the offseason.  
It's about time. He's horrendous at play calling 
FIRE THE "LAZOR"
Whenever I hear Bill Lazor's name I always think about [this scene from Dodgeball](https://youtu.be/vhRLQAl3JaU?t=8)
Why do ANY of our coordinators have a job right now and Miami is making moves like this? I fucking hate the Eagles.
Playing the JETS is not good for Dolphins coaches job security.
Baby come back. 
Fire ze Lazor!
Tannehill has to go, too. He's got no deep ball, holds on the ball too long, and when he's pressured he only drops further back, meaning that sacks are that much worse. None of those seem to be directly caused by the oc. Don't get me wrong, the OC was bad too, but do any dolphins fans think that tannehill is the future?
Lmfao, what a dumpster fire
i'm happy this happened.  it's painful to even watch this team anymore.  Next step will be to trade Tannehill and start over with a new QB.
And there's proof that maybe, just maybe, firing your coach every other year is a bad idea...
I remember when Marvin Lewis called Johnny Manziel "a midget" during a phone interview and subsequently had to hold a press conference to apologize. Some radio station sent an actual midget to just sit there and fuck with him psychologically the whole time. 

What an awesome radio station. 
Well he's making me eat my words about saying he needs to be fired
Fuck yeah he is. Fuck the haters I'll always love what Marvin had done for this team
Tyler Eifert is the first tight end in AFCN history to be 8-0. Clint Boling is the first left guard in AFCN history to be 8-0... 

Way to go, Clint!
Has there been a team that went 8-0 in the AFC North without having one head coach? 

I can see it now.  The Bengals ride into the playoffs 16-0, take a week off because they get the first round bye.  Houston comes out of nowhere with only 7 wins and Hoyer the Destroyer gets injured on the game winning drive of the wildcard round.  TJ Yates plays his heart out and leads the Texans to victory in overtime against the Bengals.  The 17-0 Patriots beat the Texans in the next round and have a repeat loss to the Giants in the Super Bowl.
Still need the playoff win
Cincy is going 16-0
Hey good for him. I'm glad the Bengals are doing well. They see like a nice group of folks
http://imgur.com/XqOopZv
Congrats other Ohio team. I'll be happy that you take the division over the other two. 
Not bad. I can see them going 9-0 after next week because they play the Texans. 

But you know, any given Sunday. 
Ravens fan here. I've always said Marvin was the real coach behind our first SB. Part of me is stoked to see him kicking so much ass this year. The other part really hates to see him doing well, because we really need a new D coordinator.
My favorite part of this post is the growing snippiness between Pats fans and Bengals fans in the comments... There's definitely an old guard vs. rising insurgent tension growing in here. 
He deserves it. People have been calling for his dismissal since his second season. Good on you Coach Lewis! 
Respect
I'm going to piss myself laughing if they go undefeated and lose in the playoffs after their bye. 
Props to Lewis but such a weird way to say the Bengals are the first team in AFCN history to be 8-0. Even weirder than the QB wins stat you see all the time. 
I always thought he was a solid coach. 
wowzers
I'm so happy for him and that team. It's only midseason but they must be over the moon.
At least it's not the Steelers.  Also, I like Marvin Lewis.
squeeeeeeeeeee
Happy for Cinci and their fans. Bungles no more!
Could not be happening to a better coach. Hope he goes far in the playoffs this year.

I still say he is Tony Dungy at Tampa Bay, holding the team back from a real playoff run. But Who Dey have something to be legit happy about, this is a very good team. 
I think maybe my prediction back when Lewis was hired as HC is finally coming true. I honestly predicted a Super Bowl from him for some reason.      Living in WV I almost always had to watch either Cincinnati or Pittsburgh so I grew a to like them just a little.  I remember my prediction like it was yesterday. I worked at a Pizza Hut and I said things will be different now.  Martin Lewis will be the guy that brings the Bungles back to relevance. Sure enough he went 8-8 his first year.  

He hasn't produced a SB (yet) but they are certainly relevant now. 
Is he also the first AFC coach to go to the playoffs 4 consecutive times and go 1 and done?
Starvin Marvin's hungry for success!

Marvin Lewis and Kirk Ferentz are in like the same position of being fairly average and fans wanting them fired for a while but then turning it around this year just one college and one professional.
Fuck yeah he is. fuck you world
Damn.  I had no idea he was still coaching there.  I just assumed, with the usual coaching carousel they have, that someone else was head coach by now.
Sooo... Doesn't this just mean the Bengals are the first team in history to be 8-0 or did something really weird happen one year.  I mean why mention Marvin Lewis specifically when you just mention pretty much anyone on the team.  Unless somehow some team went 8-0 before without its coach going 8-0?
I would cream myself over a Panthers/Bengals Super Bowl.  Championship Belt, Lombardi, and the Sword of Omens all decided in one game.
This feels like a cherry picked stat. The Steelers or Browns never went 8-0 when it wasn't the "AFC North"?
ITT: Pats fans being butthurt and talking about how Gronk is better. Also people talking about their fantasy team(s). 
Will somehow also be the first AFCN coach to be 8-0 and subsequently get fired after another first round playoff loss. 
Marvin Lewis is now 7-27 in his career in prime time games.

Congratulations, Marvin!
Will he be the first 8-0 coach to be one and done in the playoffs?
Wow, since 2002?
And will be the first coach in AFCN history to go 8-0 then lose in the first round
When you coach the same team for 30 years, it's bound to happen eventually right?
still cant win a playoff game 
He was so bad for so long. Fake it til you make it I guess.
Still will choke in the first round
So he gets a participation trophy?!
The timing on this post just earned you some traffic. 
Quick tell me the powerball numbers too. 
The timing on this post...
Just make penalties review-able like most coaches have wanted for years.  Problem fucking solved.
Just let coaches challenge penalties, now that every score is automatically reviewed most games don't have challenges at all. Several games this year have been decided or helped by bad calls from the officials, like tonights game, I'm pretty sure grazing the face mask is allowed as long as u don't grab it, the lions defender grabbed the shoulder pad of rodgers but the official wrongly thought it was the facemask and that won GB the game.
I see why the refs called it this time. Contact on the facemask and his head jerked. But inside the two minute warning, penalties need to be reviewable. This happened to Detroit twice this year.

At full speed, it really did look like a facemask, easily.
What are the drawbacks to making penalties reviewable? I'd imagine that might increase the amount of time it takes to get through one game, but is there anything else?

I doubt making penalties reviewable will solve all problems, but I'll be damned if it doesn't solve a lot of them.
...touchdown Seahawks?
I'm awaiting the NFL to apologize to the Lions in the most half assed way possible
Ha!  And add another one to the pile.
Obviously they need to allow penalties to be reviewed and challenged.
Dean Blandino gonna say that they miss as many calls on average as they did this game. And ignore the fact that again a shitty ref cost the team a game. And not just the facemask. Blatant holds on that final play.
Refs fuck up, marquee team beats perennial losing team. Same story every week in goodells nfl
Perfect timing
Here's that "facemask" on the second to final play https://vine.co/v/iWPWrbdTWO1

I get it but damn, sometimes penalties will need a review. Needs to be implemented for times like this, or the Seattle V Lions games
They got us last week. 

The fact that they are not full time employees insane!
We need to make sure our criticism is directed at the right address, which is the league itself and not the officials. The rules are ridiculous and allow too much nuance and room for wildly different interpretations, and being a ref should be a full time position that entails constant training and recertification. 

The refs haven't changed much, but the environment and rules they work under have. We shouldn't be calling for the heads of individuals, we such be insisting the league make the systematic changes which are truly at the root of this issue. 
&gt; ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just indicative of how much interest there is in the NFL, **and ultimately that‚Äôs a good thing**"

Right there it is. In other words, shitty play calling brings free publicity, he doesn't care, and it actually works out even better for them in the end. 

Fuck Dean Blandino. He could not be more full of shit.
Well this is a timely post. 
I swear the officials play favorites... And the Lions are DEFINITELY not one of them.
These refs need to be taken out back and put down.
At least we have hockey.
"We're doing a good job of investigating our officiating crews and we have determined that they are doing an excellent job."- Rodger Goodell
yeah for all the penalties that the Bills have rightfully earned this season, there have been so many that they haven't coughNickellRobeycough
Good, they cost us two turnovers last week against the Colts. These refs stink. They shouldn't be turning over the roster like they did this year
Maybe not let the TE get infront of all 6 DBs
If there is one thing that needs to be agreed on, its that personal foul, pass interference, and penalties in the last two minutes (at least) need to be reviewable.  Fuck how long the game takes.  Its already long as all hell.  A few more minutes to stop a decent amount of the bullshit would be preferable to most I think.  I'm tired of this shit.
[My solution to seamless NFL penalty reviews that wouldn't slow down the game time:]
(https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3v7l6t/goodell_says_clarifying_simplifying_rulebook_is/cxljh18?context=3).

Of course it'd need to be tweaked and such, but seems to have a decent reception. 
Guys, guys, it's ok, Goodell is going to launch an investigation, what could possibly go wrong with that? He's been so good in the past with that.
Why cant we just have refs in booths or even off-site watching the game via the multiple camera angles available at any given game, and making calls as needed. Their calls could be relayed to 3 or 4 on-site refs who can deal with announcing penalties and communicating with coaches/players. It just seems so archaic to try to referee a game based on a handful of guys ability to watch 24 players all playing simultaneously.
Sorry everyone that got fucked over this year and previous years by shitty officiating, we'll try harder next time!


-NFL
Is it wrong that my key issue with this piece is the use of the adjective - "logarithmically" in this paragraph?

&gt;‚ÄúAs soon as you come up from Division I, the rule book is far more intricate,‚Äù Carey said. ‚ÄúThe speed of the game is almost **logarithmically** faster. It is that dramatically different. You‚Äôre used to seeing it on TV. Live at full speed, it is frightening how fast everybody is and how big the collisions are. It takes two or three year to get used to it, and another two or three to be good at it. It‚Äôs hard to cover that inexperience.‚Äù

Do these people even maths?!
Thank you so much for the gold /u/KoRnyWayz !
Isn't this the 5th or 6th fucking week with at least one major screw up(s) or terrible call/no call in a game? Jesus. 
I honestly can't understand how the refs, a group that focuses on nothing but making calls, can constantly keep fucking up. It's unfathomable to me.
I actually had to double check to see if this post was here before or after the game.
I only watched the second half, but I thought the refs from Lions/Packers were pretty solid overall. People are freaking out about the face mask but honestly it was not that egregious. Plus it's not like the penalty put the Packers in some kind of amazing position.
Goodell and the piss poor officiating are the reason I stopped watching NFL this year.  Didn't order the Sunday ticket for the first time in ... hmmm, maybe more than  decade?  Can't even remember it's been so long.  

Goodell can suck my dick.  I won't come back seriously to NFL until he is gone and this corrupt ass league gets fixed.
djkhaledanother1.gif
Officiating in all pro leagues will continue to be questioned until there is some sort of transparent grading and subsequent consequences/demotions for poor performance.    
There is a flag down on the play. Let's see what it is.
"Unsportsmanlike conduct, referees. Penalty is a loss of $1000, and a turnover on downs." 
In related news I have aids,,,
The best that they can find are out there.
Have the refs been worse this year, or have the mistakes just been in more high profile spots?
"People getting angry about our incompetent refs is a good sign because it means they care about the league" is one of the more tone deaf attempts at spinning organizational failure I've ever read.
"I think our officials do an extraordinary job"

-Roger Goodell, Ruler of Integrity
How about all penalties are reviewed by the league office / refs themselves via camera in the final two minutes of games. It's a step in the right direction, and I'm sure fans won't mind waiting an additional 30 seconds when the importance of each penalty is so huge with regards to the outcome of a game. 

Of course, this is sub-ideal for games which are blow-outs. But I think that's alright? It's just 2 minutes out of 60.
Speaking of which...
lol, cluster fuck.
Did someone forget to tell the replacement refs from the lockout that we don't need them anymore?
And add one "facemask" to that tally!
Don't understand how this article could have been written without referencing the worst referee of them all: Jeff Triplette. 
Remember when all scoring plays and turn-overs became automatically reviewed? People complained that it slowed the game down, sapped momentum / fan excitement, etc. More replay reviews = more of this.

So maybe, this time, the NFL wants to you DEMAND it, instead of grin and bear it.

Step 1) Deploy some AWFUL officiating. Let the outcome of games be flipped by bad calls.

Step 2) Do nothing more than apologize to the fans for the errors. "Welp? Sorry mates."

Step 3) Watch teams, the fans, and the media band together to demand moar replays.

Step 4) Implement more liberal instant replay review rules, creating more commercial breaks.

Step 5) Profit.
Whatever your team loyalty I think we can all agree that Roger Goodell is a fuccboi. 
The meat of this article is that the Refs need more experience to actually be "good", and most refs aren't that far along yet.

If only we could give them tools to be better at their job... if only.
Ah yes, the officials don't know what down it is because technology is sooo much better. They're going to cling to this Det - GB game because at full speed it did look like a face mask but ignore the mountains of joke calls
Why are there "crews", rather than a constant mixing and matching of officials?
You can add another one to the list.
what did i miss? why is everyone talking about a bs flag? 
Who else is watching the Favre special on NFL network?
Refs or not... Hail Mary has been completed 10 times in 15 years.

Giving one up costs you a game and nothing prior to that last play can be blamed.  Shit has to go so wrong on D to allow a 65 yard pass to even be thrown let alone be caught.

Wife is a lions fan btw. I feel the pain
....and


refs win again
I find it odd on the facemask on Rodgers, that it was called by the official behind Rodgers, yet there was no way he could have known his thumb touched his facemask and would have really only seen the shoulder grab which is perfectly legal.

So unless he thought because Rodger's head turned (right into the hand) that it was a facemask, than that is BS and Rodger's completely sold that by turning his head into the hand and moved his chin strap up to sell it even more.
for real fuck the refs. they are the reason teams like the dolphins and lions can't be good! They love teams like patriots and jets
And after tonight it will be on even further review
MAKE PENALTIES CHALLENGEABLE AND WHEN THEY ARE REVIEWED MAKE THE REVIEW BE DONE BY A THIRD PARTY.
I really do hope for the worst for these shitty refs
*Sigh*

**The Packers have a young and high ceiling receiving core**
This has never been more relevant. 
I wish I could climb through the TV and bitch slap Blandino every time I hear him talk. 
Call me a conspirator but I think refs are subtly influencing games to show that they have power for more money from the NFL.
We want replacement replacement refs! Not those idiots from before, but some new guys. I'm sure it will be better the second time around.
Don't understand why there aren't full reviews allowed on controversial ref callings.  When something that is game changing such as a call like tonight, why shouldn't this be a red flag challenge?  If all TDs are reviewed why not allow a red flag to challenge ref calls?  Seems fair to allow that special flag be used, a penalty of not being allowed to throw again it again / loss of time-out can be applied, only allow one challenge rule ect...why not hold scumbag refs accountable?  

Would the game of ended the same tonight if this was acceptable? America will never know
Maybe if they worried more about having experienced refs besides throwing in newbies and worrying about the first female ref (not saying she might not be a good ref), they wouldn't have such poor officiating. I heard somewhere that an extremely high percentage of these refs are 2-3 year refs. What happened to all the experienced ones
IT'S THE NARRATIVE BOYS. DON'T TALK ABOUT IT THE NFL MIGHT PUT A HIT ON YOU.
When are we going to switch to remote review of all plays or more advanced detection technology?
After review, the referees on the field stand.
I like how Washington Post finally drew attention to the fact that nobody gave a fuck about this problem when it was happening to the small market teams perpetually getting these shitbag refs on a regular basis, even if they drew attention to it in a sneaky, sideways fashion.
Seriously, how did the refs miss that pass interference at the end of the GB DET game? 
They made so many errors against the Bucs in the game versus the Colts. I was absolutely floored that the league didn't officially apologize.

The Conte thing was annoying but he probably still would have been penalized, so I can forgive that... but that was just the icing on the cake.
Is the NFL trying to do what Soccer does, i.e have terrible refs so they can drum up publicity.
Personally, I think the league's hands are tied here. We all know that better training will lead to fewer mistakes. The problem is, a PT job like officiating means that there is drastically less time for training.

And who is to blame for that? The ref's union, not the league. The league expressed it's desire to bring in FT officials, but the ref's union fought it tooth and nail, and won. The league also wanted to hire more refs, which the union fought as well.

The league doesn't want to get itself into a big fight with the union. We saw what happened last time. (Touchdown Seahawks!)

But by giving in to the ref's, the league is now forced to deal with officials who can act with impunity. And the real losers are the fans.
But Goodell just said the officials were doing a great job!
The officiating has been so bad this year I've pretty much lost all interest in the rest of this season. 
Letting coaches challenge penalties/non-calls is a new thing in the CFL. In fact, just last week in the championship game a challenged non-call on obvious PI put the Eskimos (the winning team) at the 10 yard line where they scored the game winning touchdown. Take what you want out of that. Not arguing that it's good or bad.
These are the same refs who went on strike for not making enough money for doing a shitty job
It sounds like Mike Carey just heard someone say "logarithmically" in passing, thought it sounded cool and smart, and wanted to throw it into his interview. Based on what he sounds like during games, that doesn't sound too implausible. 
Two moves could save the NFL, first, full time well paid officials, younger ex athletes, next, order all games played on grass, watch the concussions and ACL's decline. The owners could afford it, the league could help those few that cant.
"Facemask"
Goodell says they have the technology? Well why not fucking use it to make the correct calls when a flag is thrown? I understand it may cause the game time to increase but even if it was just under 2:00 of halftime and the end of the 4th quarter, it would be a massive improvement on calls that could decide a win or loss.
[First Down!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDBQr9rOVTo)


In 2015 we should really have fewer fill refs and more in a booth. Just need refs to spot the ball and to break up fights. 
At this point we're about a season away from not even having to play the games.  The league will just publish a list each week of who won and who lost, if the games had actually been played.  Aside from the domestic violence issue, the horrid officiating is really driving me away from the product. I'll always watch every Pats game, but I've only watched maybe a half dozen games outside of that this year, which is probably 1/5 of what I would be at by this point 6 years ago.  Ironically out of those half dozen or so, 3 of them have been decided by awful officiating errors. 
lol 
When can we start replacing them with robots? More officials on a booth and less on the field imo. 
http://gfycat.com/NiftyOrdinaryBrownbear It's a weak call, and maybe it looks different in real time, but in this slomo it definetely looks like the thumb goes into the face mask and pulls it.
Is everyone seriously forgetting the blatant whip-kick on Rodgers that was a no call? Okay then. Just making sure the anti-Packers bias is in full swing before we go off here.
#DezCaughtIt
If their play is under further review by anyone like the current refs, I'm sure the wrong decision will be made.
Hey - NFL- Not going to renew my subs next year. Have fun with this bullshit. 
Maybe Roger can hire Ted Wells to write a report stating that the officials are perfect? Probably only cost a few million dollars. 
I think it would be fascinating to make average fans be refs for a day. I think their tunes would change.

The rule book is simply too complicated. Whittle it down and I think you'll see a vast improvement. I for one don't want more replay and challenges because at times the game is already super slow. 

Realistically, this isn't as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. It was a 50/50 call that went the a packers way. The ref who was on the right side of Rodgers could have overruled the ref who threw the flag. But he didn't. So I don't see that argument.

And honestly, as a Packer fan, I love seeing people complain about penalties on Hail Marys. Everyone told us that the refs do not call penalties and we should just swallow the OPI on the Fail Mary. I know it's beating a dead horse but c'mon...this is the way the NFL has played for years...get over it.
There's one part of the officiating that the NFL hasn't done to implement what the NBA did, watch and fine any player who attempts a flop.
maybe....just maybe, taylor should not have put his hand in rogers face...what did he THINK was gonna happen??
Yet another victim of the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Redskins offense 
Just in time for him to become a Mall Santa.
http://i.imgur.com/0oQCyx0.gifv
How many minutes will he be out of work this time?
May his all-out blitz rest in peace.
Ladies and gentlemen Rob Ryan has left the building. And he took the buffet table with him. Also he gave up 45 points during his exit interview. 
Kenny powers.
http://deadspin.com/look-at-this-glorious-old-photo-of-rob-ryan-1444569817
This'll be a post filled with gifs and pics, coz, y'know, that's the kind of guy RR was. 

But for Saints fans however this works out, it is great. People have seen the insanity wolf plays Rob Ryan uses. It worked well his first year - running 3 safeties with Rafael Bush was awesome! 

But then there were the crazy ones. Like having 4 linemen and 5 LBs on a 3rd and short against the Seahawks, and not covering the tight end. Tight ends have regularly lit up this unit. Running backs have rejuvenated their careers. And the big-name free agents and draft picks have been made to look like busts.

Dennis Allen has come through the Saints' system and it's nice to think he'll be given a chance. May as well. If it doesn't work - we're on the market next year.

If it doesn't work, we'll have an indicator of what level Jairus Byrd, Kenny Vaccaro, Brandon Browner et all are actually at. Are they the scrubs they've looked like this year? Or was that Ryan?

I don't like midseason firings generally. But it's a good logistical move. And I hope it turns out one man was the problem, not 11.
Who are those 2 Saints fans going to dress up as for every game now?
I hear Seattle isnt too happy with their D Coordinator. Hire him Pete...do it.
You're welcome Saints! 
I'm sad because I really liked him as a person and he was entertaining...but it was for the greater good and needed to happen.
I wonder who will be dumb enough to give him a DC job because of his brother and dad next season. 
So where does he go to create an awesome defense next year then taper off eventually resulting in his firing?
I think he'll be out of a job for longer than 5 minutes this time.
he actually didn't get fired, he quit, football was interfering with his lucrative career as a Dude cosplayer.
So was this pretty much sean payton needing owner approval to fire him?
The Redskins got someone fired!!! And also a bunch of other teams helped but the Redskins!!!!
Thanksgiving dinner is going to be awkward at the Ryan house.

Rob: "Hey bro, can I get a job?"

Rex: "Fuck off!"

Rob: "I wasn't asking for a job! I was asking for the mashed potatoes!"

Rex:  "You were asking for a job and you know it!"

Rob: "Was not!"

Rex: "Was to!"

Rob: "Was not!"

Both: "MOM!"
Hopefully Dennis Allen can get the defense turned around. Don't care about playoffs at this point, just want to see consistent and competitive defense 
Did they even consider RR impersonators in this decision? The home crowd just got a little less interesting.
Patriots Special Assistant

Just to screw with Rex.
Captain Kirk killed a man.  


Came to see a gif of him clearly saying to jay cutler "fuck you" as Browns DC. I leave disappointed.
/r/robryangifs
Forreal this time?
[Schefter says that Allen is new DC](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/666414907953426433)
He really needs to find his crowd and his moment. The important thing for him is to get back on the horse. If not, he'll just feel sorry for himself, get a little too overweight, wear nothing but sweats, stop cutting his hair or showeri.... Oh wait, nevermind.
[When you are just too damn beautiful to be unemployed. ](https://media0.giphy.com/media/5xQ55Id5L6PEA/giphy.gif)
On the bright side, now he'll have all the time he wants to run the table at Sammy Hagar lookalike contests around the nation.
The real victim here isn't Ryan himself -- it's the Saints fan who dresses up like him and attends their games. 
If him and Trestman joined forces for just one year they'd be undefeated
Hired by Rex /S
"No changes" lmao.
*DUH*
Hey Rob Ryan, thanks for helping get a Large 10 topping (only used 3) pizza at Papa Johns for only $9.99! Dinner was tasty. 
It's about time.  The guy is terrible at his job, I really don't understand why he keeps getting hired.
You guys couldn't have waiting a couple more weeks? Selfish.
TIL the Saints had a defensive coordinator.
Good. Now Rex can take off that god damn wig and focus on coaching the Buffalo Bills. 
For real this time? no take backsies?
he'll find another job in five minutes /s
It had to happen. That last game was a embarassment.
http://i.imgur.com/vwMin.gif
So he was fired, then he wasn't fired, then fired again?

That's kinda sad...

So he's had one "good" year in Oakland in 06 where the offense for fucking atrocious. I think the fact that we couldn't do shit on offense lead the other team to take it easy and hold leads with running the ball. The pass D was #1 but the run D was #25.

He also had a good year in NO in 2013 where the D was #4. He also had 9 years of below average and 1 year of the #14 D. I think it's time for everyone to admit he's just not a good DC.
I love this thread so much. That is all.
Since he's only good for a year, every team should just hire him for that period of time. 1 year contracts for all 32 teams!
We should hire him and name him a captain for our final game
Please oh please go to the bills... Need the Ryan show
Jesus fuck I misread that as rex and had a mini heart attack
Think he'll be out of work for a lot more than 5 minutes this time around.  
Fuck, now I need a new strategy for streaming QB's in fantasy.
So how many defensive coordinators do we need to go through until we figure out that its not the coach. Next one will be 5. Maybe the problem is we have 1 player left on the roster from the 2014 draft and its not a defensive player. Maybe instead of drafting a tackle to backup Armstrong and Peat with the 13th pick they should have taken Marcus Peters. Instead we draft a OT to be a backup and run Brandon fucking Browner out there who fucking holds every god damn play and still cant cover worth shit. He is like the 10th best CB on the team if you count the practice squad but he still starts every damn game.


Watch the next D Coordinator bench Browner immediately and the defense atleast improves to just bad.
Thanks a lot Saints, now all our idiot #FireCapers fans are coming out in force clamoring for a Ryan hiring.
I know Sean Payton has technically already promoted an internal staff member. BUT, Jim Schwartz is just waiting for another coaching job -- right now he's an NFL officiating consultant. If I needed a DC, Schwartz would be at the very top of my list.

Schwartz as DC and a defense-centered draft and the Saints would be a contender again in 2016.
Took longer than expected for this to occur.
YES YES YES YES YES
I thought don Vito passed away yesterday? 
DeAngelo Hall sends his regards.
I've always had a soft spot for the Saints that I tried to bury deep down inside of me because of Rob Ryan. So happy to hear he is fired! I wonder where he will end up...
Fuck Rob Ryan
[deleted]
Twice in one day...
Come to Green Bay, he can't be much worse than Dom. 
About time
Damn it, wish they woulda kept him when we played them again
Mangini next pleaseee.
He'll have another job in about five minutes
The guy maybe isn't that good of a defensive coordinator? he seems to go to a different team a lot. 
[Good Night Sweet Prince :(](http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/229/files/2013/12/Rob-Ryan.gif)
I remember when people were contemplating him getting a head coaching job.
Like, for real though?
Have fun with Dennis Allen.
https://gyazo.com/4191c4e52f94376577730cfb4e021357
Yay. I don't have to endure comments about pretending to be in the know
Next head coach of the rams confirmed.

I think he will get a job somewhere. Just not as a DC.
I somehow got these news like three hours ago.

This is just a confirmation, right?
Saints I love you but these emotional swings today were worse than mixing heroin and coke, then going on an all night bender and having sex with Whitney Houston.

But I'm liking the final outcome :)
Payton lied to us, you bastard!
Saw this on a stream, but Rob Ryan is basically Rex Ryan's before picture.
Picturing the Saints under Jim Schwartz...
I'm not going to listen to sports talk in Philly until he gets a new job because I know, I just **know** some asshat is going to bring up firing Chip so we can go back to the Good Ol' Ryan days.
THANK THE LORD 
This isn't as great as some people think it is.

Dennis Allen is the DC now - not much of an upgrade.

Joe Vitt is STILL the linebackers coach. LB has been our weakest position for all 10 years of the Brees era. 10 years. Can't imagine why. I will always love Sean Payton but his refusal to get rid of Vitt infuriates me. He sucks.
Misread the title and almost had a heart attack
Almost ~~no one~~ *Everyone* saw this coming. 
Rex-Rob 2016 confirmed.
Damnnnnnn Skins. HE HAS A FAMILY.
Was just a matter of time.  Seemed like Payton was chewing him out in every game this season.
[deleted]
He got too much publicity for a damn coordinator
Get ready to see that stupid fucking sharpie pinned on Dennis Allen's ear
Sean Payton [JUST SAID](http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000581405/article/sean-payton-says-rob-ryan-absolutely-still-his-dc) that Rob Ryan was safe 

:(
Maybe his brother will pick em up and sign em
Do you think Rex will hire his own brother?
How soon before Rex hires him and they have a show on E called "buffalo wild Ryan's"?
I'm gonna miss his hair.
poor katie nolan
315 points allowed, or 31.5 points per game.  The next closest team is the Browns with 277 points, or 27.7 points per game.  That's crazy.
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Cowboys fans like True, True
In my opinion, the biggest impact of BountyGate was the Saints losing Gregg Williams.  Say what you will about his involvement in that unfortunate episode, but he was a damn good DC for the Saints, he was a damn good DC for the 'Skins before that, and is still doing a good job for STL.
It is a sad day for Buccaneers, Panthers, and Falcons fans. 
lol, and I remember saints fans talking shit about the cowboys after signing him. 
Rob looks like a party version of Rex, he's prob got a joint stashed in the car, and his favorite word is dude.
This is about 3 years too late. 
Honestly, I lost a bit of respect for Sean Payton after this. You don't say that the reports of Ryan getting fired are premature and lash out at the person making the report, then literally 2 HOURS LATER, fire the guy.
poor Bob.
Maybe he can go to Seattle and help them improve their defense. 
Maybe his brother will hire him.
Fired twice? i guess they didn't want to make it official until now, same thig happened to Denis Allen in London and now he'll take Ryan's role.
Do it Rex. 
It was only a matter of time.
Noooooo! Why??? /Ssssss
The Saints have no secondary
Don't get too excited Bills Fans.  That's ROB Ryan, not Rex.
He looks like a dirty bogan. Not surprised by this. 
First play: 



&gt;4 yard pass. Stop recognize. 




Next play:



&gt;Pass for loss of 3 yards




Then



&gt;Pass for 3 yards. Recognize




Rinse repeat

Who says we're letting him break it?
ALL HAIL PEYTO, KING OF FOOTABLL.
They did this for Farve, and they will do it for the next guy. 
Imagine how pissed Peyton will be if he breaks the record and then throws a pick right after the stoppage? Haha. Wait- that's not funny.
So he's for sure going to do it today? How many yards does he need?
Implying KC won't hold him to 2 passing yards
I mean it'll be like the first play of the game so its not like its gonna hurt anything just in case someone is concerned about stopping the game in the middle of a crucial drive
Those yards were like the last shots out of a roman candle.
The response to those tweets
NFL really putting some pressure on this Denver passing offense, 3 yards? In one game???
Peyton was not into this at all. 
a plane will fly over and drop free Papa Johns pizzas on the crowd, it what will be known as one of the worst promotions ever
Peytons probably planning some wacky celebration again haha oh Peyton youre so young at heart
They should have a spontaneous game of keep away with the ball, too. 
He's gonna be breaking the record every completion. 
PEYTOOOOOOOOOOO
Wow. Getting booed at Lambeau. I think that's a new record  
Peyton's record setting day: 5-20, 35 yards, 4 INTs, benched in the 3rd quarter. Time to hang up the cleats, Peyton. 
Unpopular opinion: it's a major record and Peyton deserves all kinds of love for it but I am NOT a fan of stopping play for it. If they want to do a halftime thing or post-game thing I'm all for it.
What a game/season for Manning to set this record. Looks like he is one hit away from being in the morgue. Now sets the record but has 3 ints before half.
Then next week the Colts hang a new banner:

HE PLAYED FOR US TOO
Itsa mee! A Peyto Manini! 
[Have they instructed the officials to make sure Von Miller stops trying to hurt people when play stops?](http://www.arrowheadpride.com/2015/11/10/9703348/kansas-city-chiefs-beware-von-miller-broncos-penalties)
Wouldnt it be great if he broke it. Then on the next pass it went back for negative yards so he was under his own record. Then next pass broke it again and more celebrations. Then next pass it goes back again for more negative yards and repeat the whole process
Peyton, more important than the game itself. 
Annnnnnd picked.
wow that was lame
F to pay your respects 
Manning should retire after this season, he's just embarassing himself at this point.
Hope he doesn't have a choreographed moment planned like last record
I don't see what the big deal is, hell it'll probably happen on the first drive of the game. Everybody realize that this is one of the best to ever play the game. 
Seems like they should've just ended the game there.
Peyton throws pick six on his first pass of the game
Ummm, why? I know it's a big deal, but what are they going to do, have a moment of silence?
This won't be choreographed and cringe worthy at all. 
Peyton throws a pick on the first play.  The Chiefs run out the clock the rest of the way, aided by fouls by the defense at key points.
Fucking annoying it was too.
I don't find the all-time passing yards record that significant anymore. Today's NFL is far different, and it's only going to be a matter of time, when the NFL continues to become Offensive-heavy, that Peyton's record will be broken.
is Peyto continuation of Miamo?
The Broncos are going to come out today with 10 straight running plays
Should have just ended it right there

Fuck that slobber on his dick after the game 
Can they do that?  Is there a precedent?
I remember watching Peyto when he was playing college ball at Miamo. Man, how time flies.
LOL
All hail Peyto, God of Fiveheads
An ode to Peyton: I have so many good memories, wrote about you in many diaries, I spent many a game watching you with my friends, but I fear that this is the end. I respect you with everything in my being, yet I don't fear you leaving. For these Broncos are built for greatness, but your age has boughten you lateness. Hail Santan with all of your glory, fuck Tom Brady's wife with all of her whorey,  hail Peyton for all of his stories.
Peyton can actually break 2 records this game. If they win he'll also get most wins as a starting quarterback at 187 (also a Brett Farce record.

Paxton mannen is a mild mannered fellow
Passing yards taste soo gooood. Nothing beats that fresh ball smell. 
and 4th and out...nice celebration
That's stupid, the NFL doesn't need to Golden Boy anyone because they broke a record. The play itself was an insignificant four yard gain and they stopped the whole game to make sure everyone in Denver heard about it. 
lame.
Fans of Peyto are peytophiles. 
IF
How precious.
Fuck yeah
At least they won't fix the game like when Brees broke the season passing yds record.

SUDDENLY FLAGS ON EVERY PLAY
Kind of a weak way to make history but Manning is still one of the GOAT's. He deserves the recognition. He deserves one more ring even more. Good on him.

Edit: haha haters gonna hate. Fuck it. Manning all day.
And people say football is a team sport...
But what if he doesnt throw for 3 yards!?
TPP: Top Player Privilege 
Gtfoh
Serious question: how is that even allowed? 
Important to note that this is the NFL all-time passing record.. Football's all time passing record belongs to Anthony Calvillo of the CFL
Unbalanced. 

I can't see the Pats complying if this was Brady..... TEAM Football
I'm pretty sure when an owner doesn't care when a teammate stabs another teammate in the neck with scissors it is safe to assume that they don't care about what their players do to the general public.
I think we've all figured that out by now, Troy.
Late to the thread, but there's some quote that if Jeffery Dahmer was good at football many GM's would explain that he has an off the field "eating disorder."
"Jerry Richardson would never do that."
That is right. When Steve Smith sucker punched a teammate, breaking a bone in his face and most likely ending his career, 
Jerry very quickly cut him five years later. 
And if you don't produce, there's always a spot for you in Detroit. 


:(
I think the issue is that NFL teams have gotten so used to the canned responses, and the fans so used to hearing them, that the Cowboys didn't think twice about trying to defend Hardy with a bunch of generic "rah rah he's a leader" nonsense. 

We usually ignore the kind of crap anyway, I think that's what they expected. The problem is though that there is a shitload of scrutiny on Hardy, so for once people actually listened to the canned responses and took them at face value. 
Thanks John madden....
You don't say
So why haven't they tried out Ray Rice behind that o-line?
I think the Cardinals GM said something like along the lines of "If Hannible Lecter ran a 4.3, we'd probably diagnois it as an eating disorder." There's a reason Greg Hardy is in the league and not Ray Rice. I don't think it specifies to just the Cowboys
"I dwell on the past"
[deleted]
Jerry is trash. Hardy is scum. Go ahead and downvote.
/r/noshitsherlock
Michael Irving stabbed a teammate in the neck with a pair of scissors for not letting irvin skip in line at the barber. Case closed.
Shocking. J. Jones wants production over morality. Shocking. 
At what point does something become "not news" and just become common sense?  I mean, JJ can *say* whatever the hell he wants in public view and, unfortunately, many sheeple will believe it.  On the other hand, anyone that takes 30 seconds to actually think for themselves could plainly see that this is the case.  

I guess it's newsworthy that Aikman is confirming it, but did we really *need* confirmation?  
Aikman. Touchdown, Unbelievable!
And? It's Jerry's job to put together a winning football team with the best talent available to him, not sit around on his high horse passing moral judgement and proselytize to anyone who will listen 
What if that player raped Jerry Jones? 
Shocking
Exhibit A: Jimmy Johnson?
If he's fine with one player stabbing another in the neck with a pair of scissors, I can't imagine what it would take for Jones to say no. 
This is sad. There are things bigger than the game.
(e.g. Jay Ratliff and Flozell Adams)
I believe that if Greg Hardy slapped Jerry Jones around and dragged him through his luxury box by the hair, Jones would call that leadership.
Dez Bryant should test this theory and slap the shit out of Jerry.
He ain't lyin
Is he planning on breaking Aaron Hernandez out of prison then? 
About 2 decades late with that information Troy. We already knew.
Accepting 'pretty much anything' makes Jones (or whomever) a shallow, gutless coward.
Isn't this true for practically every team? Honestly?
As do almost all owners in industries where their employees represent individuals with unique and specific skill sets. 
I don't blame Jerry. We watch these people to play sports, not to be role models. Someone's right to work shouldn't be taken away if they get arrested. No one really cared till women got involved the last couple years anyway. Domestic violence was basically swept under the rug until the Ray Rice case.
Be good, or be good at it.
In the NFL, who doesnt
Honestly this shouldn't be a surprise for anyone
fuck well looks like Hardy has to stop producing then.If I were an offensive tackle I think I would try harder against Hardy than I would for other defensive ends.
All of which explains the total lack of success in the Jerry Jones as GM era. The Cowboys aren't going anywhere until Jones is gone. 
Sounds like most franchises. 
This is not really news. Every knows that Jerry Jones will do anything to win. Which is funny because as a GM he is the opposite of Belichick...who has how many wins at this point?
Too bad they haven't produced a championship in 20 years.  
"I guess the line is when he's no longer productive, you know? I think that's always been the line for Jerry Jones, is he's one to pretty much accept everything as long as a guy's productive."

So is Jerry going to cut himself?
Really? Well, I'm "not very surprised" given the behavior of some former Cowboys. 
Was this really a big secret in the first place? 
Terrell Owens produced more than any receiver in Cowboys history (over that short span) and Jerry told him to get out.

TO had a special way with people. Truly fascinating person I would love to work with.
I would've never guessed.
And in other news, water is wet. Thank you Troy. 
Not a cool trait to have
Might as well sign Ray Rice.
I guess he doesn't think that way about coaches, then.
That's how every job should be.
Good for you Troy. 
So does every other team.  Let's not act like  the Cowboys cutting Hardy would set an example.  He'd be picked up immediately. 
it's why he's a shit owner. 
[deleted]
Does he let them dwell on the past? 
when this was happening with the cowboys in the 90s it was easy for people to overlook it because they were winning superbowls. but that was 20 years ago and players have become even worse as people , or at the very least its getting reported more or they are getting caught more. there certainly are more "me me me" players then theyre were then also. you cant run this type of shit show in 2015 and expect success anymore. it just doesn't work. 
This is football. Of course players that produce are gonna be on the field. 
Every team has had a douche bag on their roster at one point or another. This isn't specific to Jerry Jones.
Is this today's "shit on the Cowboys" thread? I thought I had missed it.
That's the way it should be.
This was evident with the Terrell Owens signing.
Jerry Jones is No. 1 in AP, UPI, and FBI
Shots fired!
&gt;produces

&gt;2-6

&gt;6 straight losses

Ok
And why shouldn't he? How many employers fire employees after making personal judgments about them while their professional relationship is stellar?
Can't blame him, if the masses who are outraged are unwilling to so much as change their viewing habits of NFL football why should he do something that affects his bottom line. 

  
I'm so glad the Packers have standards beyond on-field performance. Obviously you can't avoid everything, but there are teams (like Dallas) that just seem to invite these kinds of guys into their locker rooms. 
As he should. It's not his job to police the players it's the league's. He should be trying to put out the best product there is. I understand the whole outcry for social responsibility (and it's heightened when the local taxpayers are funding the stadium), but look if I owned a team I'd be trying to start the best talent week in and week out, because no one cares after a few weeks about scandals or arrests unless they want to.  
  

I would too.
Sometimes I really hate Aikman. 
well fuck there goes the streak. Although does it count for players not with a team?
You know your life is bad when you spend your Tuesdays at a casino in Kansas
Sources at the casino tell TMZ he was initially asked to leave for being too drunk -- but on the way out, spit on the floor and assaulted a security officer. 
He is in the don't hire me mode.
Dude's got serious problems.
did he just say 'fuck life' in the last few months or something?  

also, wtf is doing at a casino in kansas of all places?
Man, that idiot fell so fast out of the limelight. Dudes got a little girl. How the fuck is he gonna keep acting like that.
Damnit man, get your life together. You have physical gifts and opportunities most would kill for. Check into a psych ward or something, get help, don't ruin your life so early.
No wonder he got cut - he doesn't have "Get away from the cops speed"
&gt;**NFL**'s Joseph Randle arrested at a casino in Kansas for assaulting and officer 

Not our problem anymore!
What a moron.
For assaulting and officer? 
TIL there are casinos in Kansas. 
Apparently don't draft oklahoma state players. 

justin gilbert-work ethic problem i believe, could be wrong, not starting after being drafted 5th overall

Justin Blackmon-likes to drink and drive a little too much

Joseph Randle-see thread

Brandon Weeden-just not very good. 
Well that was fast
assaulting and... assaulting and...
This guy sure is something.
&gt; assaulting and officer
Sad to see man, I think he's clearly got issues.
HE DINDU NUFFIN
Wow. I loved him at Ok St. Sad to see how this has turned out.
[LOL](http://imgur.com/EL5IYfs)
[Awkward...](http://i.imgur.com/VDdxK8M.png)
He should've assaulted a woman so Jerry Jones would take him back. So long and thanks for all the downvotes.
He's not on a team, so does it count?
This is why we can't have nice things.
This guy is king of the idiots.
So sad. His brother was my mentor at work and he is doing very well for himself. Larry has a good head on his shoulders so I wonder what's going on with Joseph. 
YOU HAD ONE JOB JOSEPH!
The assault is serious enough but when you tack on that "and officer" charge is gets positively medieval 
He's not on an NFL team right now rigbt? Streak still alive?
in a 12 man keeper, was thinking of stashing him for next year since i'm done this year...... decisions pretty much make themselves
"Do you know who I am?!?" 
Fucking moron.
Joke about meat on bones
That settles it. Dallas will re-sign him.
Yeah, he's not making a comeback.  Imagine how messed up mentally you have to be to completely throw away the opportunity at a successful NFL career.    

Hope he gets the right help.
The streak...is over.
I'm guessing the NFL isn't too thrilled about him being called "NFL's Joseph Randle" when he doesn't even play for a team
my 3rd pick in fantasy :(
And that breaks the NFL record of days without an NFL player arrest. 
Whoever posted that link about the streak is a douche. YOU JINXED IT!!!
Lol. Reset the clock boys.
So much for that arrest-free streak for NFL players.  

Referring to: http://nflarrest.com/arrest-o-meter.html
You can't do that!
I thought what happened in Kansas stayed in Kansas.
 [I came pretty close to predicting this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3riygh/whose_line_is_it_anyway_wednesdayweek_eight/cwog5sm?context=3)
Idiot. 
He needs a mentor man, there's something in his head or past that he can't get by and keeps self destructing.   
Browns managed to bench him. 
Look high af
Something something leadership something something Jerry Jones
Randle and Manziel should consider starting a club.
Start playing the Clown Music
Commentators jinx man
this dude has gone full retard. never go full retard.
Da fuk is goin on with dis guy?
Wow that was quick. RIP streak
I didn't know officer was against the law.
oh well the NFL had a good streak going
For assaulting and officer? What the fuck?
Hahaha this is the casino in my hometown 
I love that this is just under the post about no arrests.
Damn, I enjoy going to that Casino.
so close to the record
I can understand assaulting, but officer too? Too far.
Somebody put his days without incident counter at 0.
Meat on the bone
And there goes the streak ...
Good try tho http://i.imgur.com/VMcqO41.jpg 
Assaulting AND officer, that's pretty bad.  
Well there goes that no-arrest streak.

Edit: Apparently the streak is good anyways.
[deleted]
Well, Randle fucked up that record
Shit. Kinda reminds me of the Titus Young situation. 
Lol like an hour ago there was a thread about how we were like 3 days from breaking the no arrest record.
Days without an arrest: 0
aaaaaand there it is.  someone just had to jinx the streak this morning, didnt they
Dang he's really trying to get back on that Cowboys roster...

He'll be back in DAL in no time!

Can't fix stupid
So much for that NFL no - arrest streak!
3 fucking days away...

ITT: Kansas/anywhere in the US sucks.
MY MIND'S TELLING ME NO!!!

BUT MY METRICS! MY METRICS ARE TELLING ME YEAHHHH

I DONT SEE NOTHING WRONG, WITH A LITTLE CUTLER TIMEEEE
I'm going to enjoy this moment while it lasts.
"Stats don't count if they disprove gut feel"
Cutty's been quietly having a great year. Very impressed with him in Adam Gase's system.
fucking mike ditka
Shit on Packers Week is brutal. And it's only Tuesday. 
A title I'd never expect to read for 500, Alex.


I never thought Cutler was bad, he just seemed to be the scapegoat last year for a lot of their issues. 
http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/077/so_good.png
This is really the first year he's had on the bears with a competent offensive coordinator and talent around him. He dragged a shit show of an offense to the nfc championship game.
Not sure if Cutler made a deal with the devil,

or Rodger's devil deal expired.
The King in the North!
I hope this midseason slump weens off some bandwagon Packers fans. 
WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW???
I'd suddenly like to keep the subscription to Aaron Rodgers Facts going. 
I have the biggest football boner right now.

It keeps getting bigger. I don't even know what this feeling is.

Should I call a doctor?
This is going to be a long week isn't it.
Holy shit there are some salty ass packers fans in here. The article is about how well Cutler is playing it's not shitting on Rodgers. 
Would anyone honestly rather have Cutler than Rodgers?
That is one of the many headlines I did not think I would read this season.
The numbers don't lie, and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice. 
Maybe Ditka and Rice made a deal where they agreed to where devil gear so their opponents would not win another game until the commercials end. 
Not according to Joe Buck. Holy fuck that guy is so biased.
Cutler isn't a better quarterback than Rodgers. That much is obvious. What should be recognized is that Cutler is still a great QB who can get the job done.
Aaron Rodgers reminds me of Patrick Bateman. 
I'm not shocked. Our offense sucks, Aaron is a hot mess, and Cutler is an underrated quarterback.
This is over the past six games. ARod just played against 2 undefeated teams in a row and lost 3 in a row. You could cherry pick several quarterback's stats over six games and say that they are playing better.

Cutler is playing well this year though.
I pray for the day "the stats prove x player is playing well" is  laughed at. Stats don't prove ANYTHING. Stats let you frame an argument. Those stats can be, and often are, wildly misleading (2013 Foles). This isn't baseball. Football is 11 moving pieces working together. Chicago's offense is working better as a unit than Green Bay's offense. 
This week has brought me so much joy and it is only Tuesday!
OH SNAP!
For almost my entire Cutler fandom, my contention has been that the stats DO lie. They've lied both in his favor and against him in the past, and I'm not going to change my tune just because they work for him now, as "reported" by a notoriously fluffy site.

E: Also, this article seems convinced that "evidence" and "proof" mean the same thing.

E2: My "tune," as it were, is that Cutler hovers right around the periphery of top 10, anywhere from 8-12, at any given point. His stats have almost always been 15th-20th. My premise is that a lot of his added value is not reflected in rigid measurements of passer efficiency, and that his ability to succeed in situations where even greats wouldn't supersedes his tendency to make mistakes that even scrubs wouldn't.
The Bears would legitimately be 1-8 without Cutler this year, maybe 0-9. He has more than held down the forst despite injuries all over the offensive line and at receiver. It's satisfying to see him finally paired with a decent playcaller and coaching staff.
Finally cutler is getting some love. 
You know...there's two things I've always jokingly said as a Bears fan, tongue firmly planted in cheek- 1. You can, if you want, attempt to excuse all of Jay Cutler's career short comings as being the result of never having an actual coach and OC in Chicago, and 2. could do a chick or the egg argument with Rodgers and Nelson. 

Now, neither of these was actually said entirely seriously before (and that second one still isnt), but....maybe Jay Cutler really did just need an actual NFL quality staff behind him? And maybe Nelson plays a much larger part in making Aaron Rodgers who we think he is than we thought he did? 

Who knows, maybe Cutler is in the process of a Rich Gannon renaissance.
No, no. Nothing to see here! Same old Cutler, same old Bears! Move along!
#SINNERS REPENT! THE END IS NIGH!
No joke, just gagged a little bit. 
I very strongly disagree that 4th quarter comebacks should be measures of quality between the two.  Firstly, Rodgers has only had 3 losses so far so he really hasn't had many opportunities to make comebacks so he is being penalized in this reporters eyes for being in control for most the game. Just seems like a bad reason to dock him. Other than that though I do agree the cutty has been quietly great 
BAE CUTLER! 
#clutchler 
#DITKACURSE
Its okay Greenbay, we know how you feel. 
Jay Godler.
Where are all of the Cam defenders to say that stats don't tell the whole story?
Stats lie all the time

literally all the time

a throw at the back of a defender that a WR saves counts as a completion

that's a straight up lie, because the stat sheet won't tell you anything about the quality/process of the completion

Stats are pointers, eyes don't lie. Stats just tell you what to look at. Although eyes lie when you're not good at knowing what to look at. Plenty of people have no idea.
I'm on /r/nfl? This sounds like some /r/nottheonion shit

Edit: [source](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2015/passing.htm)

...but hey, one stat over a smaller sample size means Cutler is better. Or something.
Stats don't lie, but you can use stats to lie.

(no opinion on the story, but the whole "numbers don't lie" statement to backup your argument is bullshit).
But who would you rather have as your QB?
Its Jordy Nelson. He was the entire 'deep game'. Without him its just like the Cowboys without Dez. The defense can, and will, cheat up because they know the deep ball isn't a real threat. 


I love James Jones, but he ain't Jordy. 
God, the Sports Mockery is garbage. Stop giving these people clicks. 
But both are better than Teddy :(
Y'all mocked me when I said Cutler was MVP this year. 
Yes, he is
I've been saying for four years Cutler was just as good as Rodgers, he just needed the right people. I feel vindicated. 
I just got a terrible premonition: what if this stretch is what finally convinces management that it's time to part ways with McCarthy?  Imagine Rodgers with a competent HC!

Don't visit this website without an adblocker. I clicked on it at work and it's pretty bad.
I don't know why anyone is surprised Rodgers is struggling. It's like Brady in 2013, he has no one to work with (he probably has more than Brady did, but he's also playing better than Brady did in 2013). Oline is bottom 5, no semblance of a run game, drops a fucking palooza, the 12 million dollar receiver we signed is taking the year off and our other starting WR is a guy who just got cut from 2 teams in the offseason. Plus a practice squad TE in a pear tree. Shit sucks.
I still have faith in my boys. Rodgers will come around and there's no doubt in my mind that we'll make it into the playoffs, and since I don't think Seattle will get a wildcard spot, we should be good lol
Unnnnnfffffffffff.......
Wasn't there a shit ton of Jay the earlier this year? Like, all off-season and through pre-season?
Good thing I picked up Cutler when someone dropped him last month
The thirst of /r/nfl is amusing.
Still sour that Ben got injured the one year he'd have a real shot at contending for that MVP...

Oh well, grats to Cutler, glad to see new faces at the top of the charts... Now if we can just get rid of that Brady guy...
I've gotten in too many arguments with people who've said the Bears are horrible this season. No, we aren't winning a Super Bowl. We aren't making it to the playoffs, but we aren't horrible. The thing that pissed me off even more are the people who say that getting rid of Cutler would only benefit us. (This comes from people who usually know nothing of football). Of course he's had troubles with turnovers, but he's had reasonings for that. He's the best quarterback we've ever had in Chicago for a reason. I'm not saying he's a HOFer, but he's a solid god damn quarterback in our system, with a solid coach for once.


Jared Allen needed to go too. Wasn't going to strive in our defense.
He has Alshon Jeffery and Martellus Bennet and Forte (or is he injured?). Rodgers has a couch receiver, a supporting cast receiver, a 270 pound runningback, Etc. 
I think I'm just gonna avoid this sub for a while...
what a time to be alive!
So is much of the league. 
He is only outplaying him since week 4. Rodgers is still outplaying him for the season based on QB rating, but I'll take it! Woot!
Stats lie constantly, especially in football. 
Who the f cares. Rodgers career &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; cutlers 
Lol sports mockery.
Over the season Rodgers has better stats. 

Cutler has always shown flashes, but over a full season he always comes down to earth.
[deleted]
QB missing his Top 3 receiver and no run game looks worse than QB with his star WR and a run game. 

Big news.

Edit:  Learn to read.  Nelson is the Top 3 receiver, Rodgers didn't lose his 3 best receivers. 

Also, their offense was effective with Nelson drawing the best CB and he and Cobb both could stretch the defense which allowed for the running game to succeed. Cobb can't make up for Nelson and it effects the rest of the offense 

The Bears have been without Jeffrey for part of the year, yes.  But not the entire year and he's lit it up since he's returned. Yes, Forte is out but he was great for most of the year and the Bears also have better depth than the Packers (the Packers players are just more well known because of how well Rodgers spreads the ball when his offense works well) . 
So when an elite quarterback has an unusually bad stretch, and Jay Cutler has an unusually good stretch, Cutler's now an elite quarterback?

This is a pretty good stretch, considering Cutler is like 17th by YPG, 16th by completion percentage, 13th by YPA and 12th by rating. 

He's literally not in the Top 10 by any comparable metric, lol. And he's dead center by accuracy and yardage. That 2.6:1 TD:INT ratio looks awesome next to Rodgers' 7:1.


LOL. But who would you rather have as your QB? Yup. Exactly. 
Lacy done got fat and made Packers one dimensional. Don't blame Rodgers. Don't say it's only because Lacy is out. 
And the bears still managed to get beat by Green Bay
The stats lied he's not outplaying Aarom Rodgers watch the tape
Im pretty sure blaine gabbert is out playing Rogers at the moment 
In week 10 Cutler threw two passes a total of 2 yards with 170 yards after catch. 
You're not watching the same sport, clearly. 
please
He will probably complete more passes to Packer players, too.
Ehhhh small sample size.
And Tom Brady is over there dropping bombs and winning games like he has always done
Right now. If we take their careers as a whole it's not even remotely close lol 
On my fantasy team I have Cutler and Carr.  Last week I played Carr.  Now, Carr is good, he scored 20 points for me.  But Cutler did almost 40.

I lost by 16 point.
So if r/NFL (and mostly the other members of the NFC North) are ejaculating this hard over the Packers tailspin...I can only imagine what it will be like once the Patriots finally start showing signs of weakness. I was not a Redditor when the Pats laid an egg against KC last year, btw. 
Well Cutler is the highest paid QB in the league. I would expect him to outplay everyone.
The source is from Chicago, it only covers 3 games, the only statistical advantage Cutler has is completion percentage, and it didn't take into account the Packers played two unbeaten teams with top defenses. I might be biased, but I'm still calling BS on this.

Just fuck my shit up Rob.
What about 2 games? Could you do TWO games?
Great news, now i only have to worry about Hightower,Collins, Amendola, and Edelman!

If he's right, then yesterday is the best heartbreaking loss ever.
Gronk was only scared because he's had knee injuries before.  Gronk just nervous.  Gronk be back next week.
Didn't they sign Fauria two weeks ago?

I swear Belichick is a cyborg from the future.
I think he should take off two just to be exxxxtra careful. 
My sacrifice has been accepted
The human in me says "good"

The fan in me says "dammit" 
So we may have gotten our wish to trade the loss for getting him back.
It weirdly feels like the Monday after a victory

And yet, I'd imagine the Patriots are feeling the same motivation that they would feel after a loss

 #prayfortheNFL
I trust Ian Rapoport, but for the love of god please let this be true.
Just keep him out until the playoffs. My heart can't take it. 
pulling for a Cards/Pats superbowl, so this is good news.

(My SB choice is because this way either Fitz gets a ring, or my Gatebros continue to wreck shit and much saltiness from everyone else ensues)
Brady is going to take out his frustrations on a dying eagle *sad kaawww* 
I'm glad sacrificing my newborn was not in vain. 
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Thank fuckin God. I had ptsd flashbacks back to 2013 with Gronk writhing on the ground like that. Get better soon Gronk. 
Which one of you sacrificed your first-born last night?
The NFL is looking at the Patriots like " WHY. WON'T. YOU. JUST DIE?!"
Good. I don't want to see a Gronkless patriots
If I were the pats organization I'd be careful with when I bring gronk back. You're gonna win the division so you're going to the playoffs. If you keep winning and are in a good place to secure the conference's #1 seed then don't rush his return. 
Patriots should make it 2 games. You know just to be safe
I am full flag ship.
Son of a bitch
Praise the football gods
That's good. Seeing him right after the hit scared the Hell out of me. The way he was rolling around I thought that he tore his knee up.
Wow really?

That looked pretty bad...

I wouldn't chance him since you're already a lock for playoffs.
Ian rapoport. Lol
RoboGronk    
The Gronkinator      
The Million Dollar Gronk     

Don't you dare fuck with my heart Ian!!
Thank god, the NFL isnt the same without him.
Sweet baby Jesus thank you for Gronk. 
At this rate we'll have another starter injured by the time he gets back anyways.
Great news! 
I can't wait to get beat by Bradley Fletcher and Patrick Chung.  Miles Austin is already getting for mercy.
I feel like he should take off 2 weeks, just to be safe. They'll need him for the playoffs. 
[The train is back on track boys!](http://gfycat.com/SphericalShoddyDogfish)
The hell? I was nearly crying last night after seeing him go down. I was getting 2013 PTSD all over again. Hey, here's a fucking hint Josh McDaniels: STOP MAKING GRONK DO SEAM ROUTES.....save it for the playoffs.
all that drama for this lol 
Get well soon you big stupid doof, I want you on the field so jets can shut you down right proper when you come and play in our house.
Good. Without Gronk this simply would've been a season of "What If's?"
https://youtu.be/np6vAuS0KNs
WOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! 
Two... Two seems like a good number. 
What did he do-just hyperextended it?
[deleted]
I would keep him out of the Eagles game just to be absolutely sure. Or at least monitor his snap count.

Either way, we should be okay after this. We still have Jones, Amendola should be back in the lineup before Houston, and all we have to do is get a first-round bye to buy us an extra week for Edelman.
Good news for Patriots and any Gronk fan. Too bad he won't be back on time to kick the Eagles 
As much as I hate the Pat's, thank God!!! Gronk is literally the only thing that gets me through Patriots beat downs. Also he maybe the best player to ever come out of WNY! 
That's good to hear. Of course it would be better for no games to be missed.  
But how many parties will he miss? 

None. Because Gronk can party no matter what his physical condition is. 
He can always go be MOJO's tag partner. HYPE BROS! 

(I don't care for the Hype Bros)
Hate to see anyone get injured. Glad he will be back quickly. 
As a Jets fan, and Gronk owner in FFB. I'm Thrilled
Phew
Glad to hear. Way too many ACL/MCL tears this season
I've never seen anyone writhe around like that on the field. Really hope he's well and ready for the Pats playoff run.
I think the pats should just put gronk on the sideline till the playoffs. I hold my breath every time he catches the ball.
As a fan of good football players, this pleases me. 
The man couldn't walk off the field.
Damn I'm so excited. Revenge after a loss and against the Eagles? As a Cowboys fan I feel like those South Park Comcast employees right about now. 
"unlikely to miss any time, is week to week, most likely missing only one game, missing more than one game, missing several weeks, out for season, our for rest of life." - Ian Rapoport
Cool. Glad he'll be ok. Now sit him for the next 4 weeks to keep him healthy 
Bear Down
I think this game was important for reddit's Pats fans. I don't care if I'm a football Uncle Tom or whatever but I personally cannot stand some of the shit that is said by pats fans in this sub. We took a bullshit loss, yes, but now I feel like gametime discussions will have less of a holier-than-thou feeling to it.

I hope this horrible 12 hours was enough to jerk us out of our slump and get back to being the great fans we are
 #PrayForTheNFL
18-1? This time it wouldn't be a perjorative.

OF course, I just hope they stop calling OPI on every call. He has 5 this year, when he had 4 in his entire career.

That won that would've sealed the game last night (3rd and 5) was just stupid. 
Iron Man Gronk
This made last night's loss feel so much better
Let us rejoice, yesterday never happened 
Praise jesus
Please be true. Please. I need Gronk in my life
I think the sacrifice is working.

^very ^good

Thank the lord above, without him our playoff push become slim to none.
Finally, I can stop crying myself to sleep.
There is a God
WOO-HOO.

No Hightower's going to be a bitch, but I would much rather be the 2nd seed and healthy than 15-1 and be without Gronk/Edelman/Collins/Hightower.
Why was the cart used then?
I just got an alert saying he WOULD miss multiple games
Seeing him roll around like a pansy is now actually really funny
Good, tired of hearing the crybaby Patriots whine about this
these patriot cry babies man. I cant tell you how many novels of text ive read saying how basically their entire franchise is done before ANY word came out about him. Christ you people
Isn't that knee suspect now, though? Seemed a little loosey goosey, like it could happen again any time.
The way Gronkowski was writhing around on the ground you'd have figured his leg had been blown off! 

Come to find out it's a mere flesh wound? He could have limped to the sideline and walked it off, maybe come in the game later on! 

Grow a set Gronk! 
Pls
Noooooooooo he's fantasy Gold!!!!
You gotta hit him in the arc  reactor to actually take him out.
So all the Pats fans crying that their 10-1 season was over can shut up now
The Texans are not scared of you Patriots. I'm sick of all these cowardly Texan fans expressing how terrified we all are of the Sunday night game. We're going to put the fear of God in Brady. Mark my words. JJ Watt and the defense will remind you that you can't win forever with nobody's on offense. 
Good, I like gronk and I also don't want Patriots fan whining about injuries after they lose in the Super Bowl 
I have a funny feeling he'll re injure it later this season.
Great to hear. Loved beating the Pats, hate seeing one of the true greats in the game go down. Hope to see him back soon. 
Patriots cheating once again

Can anyone explain why NFL refs are so reluctant to eject a player?  How did that not warrant an immediate ejection?  Try doing something like that in baseball or soccer, etc...
He should be happy the NFL doesn't follow Hammurabi's code. 
I honestly thought he'd get two games. But this is a pretty well deserved penalty. Talib should take this time and try to figure out how he wants to play the game.
It was a dick move and if I'm the Broncos I'm even more mad that it took away any chance of the offense getting the ball back. 
Pretty well deserved. 
He deserves it. Not only was it dirty, but he did it at the worst possible time. He may end up with just a fine, but a 2 game suspension is what he needs
But Adam Jones didn't get anything for slamming Amari Cooper's head on his helmet

GG NFL 
Captain insano shows no mercy 
One eye, one game. 
Good.

Absolutely looked intentional. Most people would be fired for doing anything close to this at their job.
Yep, right on. Just a dick move, bad note to end the game on.
I think this is OK. 

But if he does it again... TAKE HIS EYE!
He is going to lose close to $250,000 for getting suspended. Serves him right.
Hold up, Jernigan* eye pokes Tom Brady and gets off free, but Talib eye pokes and gets a suspension? 

What's up with the eye-poke regulations?
He should be suspended for that but my question is how the fuck does he get suspended for this but Pacman Jones only got a fine for slamming Coopers head of his helmet? 
Good. Personally I think one more game suspension would be warranted, but I can't say I'm not biased so one is fine.

Edit: He's going to try and appeal. I can't wait to hear his arguments.
And yet Pacman Jones gets fined 35k for slamming Amari's head onto his own helmet. 

Don't get me wrong, Talib's suspension is deserved. But, whoever runs the punishment division is inconsistent as fuck.
I'm actually surprised he got suspended. It's deserved, but it's an unexpectedly hard line for the NFL, who usually goes easy on things that are not explicitly spelled out in the CBA. Which is why they love to fine people for stupid shit like shoe color or wearing the wrong socks.

Let's hope the appeal is held up. He absolutely should have to pay the price after refusing to own up to his jackassery.
Reports: Cpt. Insano appealing the suspension 
Can someone please explain to me how poking someones eye is worth a 1 game suspension but Pacman Jones trying to give Amari Cooper brain damage is worth a $35k fine? 

How does this make ANY sense. 

For Reference: 

[Pacman ~~attempting murder~~ smashing Amari Coopers head on his own helmet after removing it for no reason. Apparently some people had a problem with my exaggerated "attempted murder" comment. ](https://streamable.com/v1q6)

[Talib Eye Poke](https://streamable.com/v7y8)
I'll take "punishments no one actually thought the NFL would go through with for $400, Alex"
Eyes are easily the most important part of football...and life. Fuck that guy. 1 game is bullshit. 
I wish I could poke my coworker in the eye and get a one week vacation out of it. 
I've probably watched the replay 30 times, and can't see a single shred of evidence supporting his "it was an accident" defense. For nearly three seconds before Talib pokes him in the eye, Allen's head remains motionless as he's jawing with Miller. Talib simply walks over and shoves his index and middle fingers into Allen's right eye.

It's going to be a shame when Talib only has to pay a fine after his appeal.
So disappointed in him. This does a lot of damage to the team, the media and fan's perception of the team, and to corneas.
Noice 
I can't believe this dude is trying to say that he went to pat him on the head.  You pat people in the face with 2 fingers out, dude?  Stop insulting our intelligence.  Stop acting like a bag of dicks.  Take your suspension for being a fucking child and smarten up.  You're too old to be pulling this shit and hurting your team.  
Hey Broncos fans, more is to come.  Believe me.  Have an elite receiver beat that guy and taunt him a little here and there and Talib will be implode.
It will be interesting to see how the Player's Association reacts to his appeal, given the crazy bastard could have gone after any one of them, and someday might.
Really feels like that deserves more than one game.
Good, he deserves it. Hopefully he won't act stupid again...
But pacman Jones can slam our receivers head into the ground and not even get ejected.
I say he goes eye for eye and its even
Honest question, have there been any players that don't appeal their suspension?
Why was every thread on this incident deleted last night? 
The other thing working against Talib here is that he wasn't involved in the initial conflict. He chose to come over and poke the dude in the eye. I think it's one thing when you're in the heat of the moment and some dude is in your face, but to just trot over and jam your finger into his face shows intent.
If he wins his appeal it would be nice for the Broncos to sit him and not let him play to show they don't stand for this.  I don't think they do, have always been a well run organization.  
Yeah guys come on it was an honest mistake he just wanted to poke the guy's nose and he moved at the last minute
Noice
This is the kind of stuff I worried about when we acquired Talib. I was honestly more worried about off the field, but still . . .

I'm glad he's getting punished, but I think some of the other guys out there who have done the same (or worse) should face similar punishments. 

I especially want other teams to know the fans are not condoning Talib's behavior. I've seen hundreds of Bronco fans be pissed at Talib for what he did, and I'm proud of that.
M O R O N

O

R

O

Why dont they just cut his fingers off and call it even
Good. Hopefully he learned his lesson. 
Taleb hit Allen with the old Ric Flair signature. 
The only appropriate response was "Captain insane-o shows no mercy"
Captain Insano shows no mercy
I've posted this so many times today but

Lol

"Player safety"
That's a bit harsh. Wilfork was never suspended for poking Brandon Jacobs in the eye. Same with Pernell McPhee after he poked Brady in the eye during last year's playoff game. 
https://twitter.com/ProFootballTalk/status/663815482709966848
Apperently they are trying to appeal it? Like what is there to appeal even. This dude forcefully stabbed another player in the eye for no reason; he wasn't even part of the mini scuffle between Dwayne Allen and the other Bronco's player. He just shows up pokes the dude in the eye. He should get more that one game suspension if we're being honest. 
If two guys are going at it and one takes a cheap shot then it's bad form and deserves a punishment.  But in this case Talib just strolled up to the guy and poked him, without being involved beforehand.  He inserted himself into the situation unprovoked.  That makes it so much worse IMO.
That ought to learn him.

A fun fact: Only three things were effectively illegal in the first UFC event. One of them was eye-gouging.

So an action that was deemed unacceptable between two men whose jobs were to punch, kick, and choke the other into unconsciousness, when the rules were at their *most permissive*, is only worth a single game suspension in the NFL, lol.
Good, sounds about right. Now that everyone is agreement that it was a shitty thing to do, and it's good that he got some kind of punishment, even though it's inconsistent with other incidents because the NFL is stupid, we can stop circlejerking about it, right? Or do we need a fourth, fifth, sixth thread where everybody says the exact same thing and agrees with each over and over?

Who am I kidding, this is /r/nfl, this will get run into the ground until the next player does something stupid on the field and the cycle repeats. 
should have been at least two.  One for the bull shit eye gouge and another for violating the point of emphasis this offseason about players not getting involved in fights/arguments.
[Schefter confirmed that Talib's appealing it] (https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/663815530407587840)

As for the suspension, I'm glad that the NFL decided to suspend him. Absolutely classless move by Talib.
easily the dirtiest play i've seen so far this year. the victim blaming afterwords was also total bullshit.
He deserves more.
I'm a little surprised, but more bummed, that the NFL didn't suspend Von Miller for that intentional knee to the neck. This shitty after the play move is way more serious because its a giant man putting at least half his weight on someone's fucking neck and then grinding his knee in. I love watching how skilled he is, but Von doesn't get the credit he deserves as one of the dirtiest players in the NFL. 
One freaking game are you kidding me? Did he at least get a big fine out of it?
ITT: Pacman Jones
He deserves it, plain and simple. Because of his actions our team gets hurt in not only yesterday's game but this upcoming Sunday. Makes me very glad we have Bradley Roby who would start at corner for a lot of teams in the NFL.
He saw a bug fly into the guy's eye, and he tried to get it.  The guy should be rewarded for his kindness. 
Ice Up Son

I bet he can win the appeal since Pacman didn't even get suspended for something worse.
A lot of people in this thread are going to be calling for Talibs head. Most will want more and are going to be angry with the punishment. It was an obvious a deliberate act that is entirely uncalled for, But the NFL has shown precedent that acts like this for a first time offender only get a one game suspension. Emotions on it are high but the punishment is consistent 
Totally justified.  The only surprising part about all this is the NFL efficiently handed out a totally fair and reasonable punishment!
And we'll probably still lose next week. 
Dumbest thing I've seen all year.
All the worse things suh or pacman did over the season and no suspension?
He can use this week to Ice Up.
He's appealing it.
The funny part was it wasn't even part of scrum or brawl.  Literally Talib was clear of the whole situation, walks up to him, and randomly pokes him in the eye.
The penalty is warranted, but how this got a one game suspension, and the PacMan Jones bullshit from week 1 got just a fine is beyond me. The NFL really needs to consider how they scale punishments. 
He should get a 1000 game suspension, dude's a wrong'un
Wouldn't it be grand if arbitrators could increase penalties also?
The only thing I can think of with the Pacman thing is that it was in the middle of the play.  Talib had 10 steps to think about what he was about to do, and still did it.  Both should be 2 games off.  Fucking dudes need therapy.  
An eye for a game. 
Should be more than one game IMO. 
i think gregg williams is happy about this
Klis did murder that sentence.
And he doesn't get to go out and play for recess, and we called his mommy. Now he's grounded.
that was just 

disturbingly messed up
Good. He deserves every second of that suspension. There's no room for shit like that on the field.

Between his Three Stooges bullshit and Von Miller's throat slamming, we look like nothing but a team off thugs. It's embarrassing
I'm almost always one to complain about the league being too harsh with their punishments, but this I'm perfectly OK with.  I was shocked the refs didn't boot him during the game.
Yes
Just 1 game?
would it have been a two game suspension if he poked both eyes? 
Yeh as expected, I think what needs to happen is coaching needs to sit him down and set up something to make sure he doesnt act like a dumb ass again
Had a long weekend... I didn't even see what happened. Does anybody have a video or gif of the dirty play by Talib?! Thanks!
Captain insano.
Is his twitter avatar a cross between Philip Rivers and Bill Belichick?
Its nice to know that a player can assault someone and get a 1 to 2 game suspension but if they ever smoke weed... God have mercy because goodell won't 
I saw he used two fingers, I think he should get a two game suspension. For all we know if he hadn't been ejected the very next play it could have got worst. This man might be a long time Ric Flair fan, I assume he would have pulled brass knuckles from his pants and punch Andrew Luck in the face and then flop on the ground like he's dead, and then when the other team goes to beat him, he begs for mercy, and then hits someone in the nuts when they drop their guard. 
Just coming here to say that I hope someone made a Three Stooges reference or I hate all of you.
"Hey bro, you got an eye booger... Here just let me get it for ya"
Man what a douche, he deserves that suspension. Hope he loses the appeal too.
Forgive my relative ignorance but I come from a rugby background where an incident like this would result in a red card (ejection) if caught by the ref, and an approximately 20 week ban (for example Julian Dupuy got 23 weeks for making contact with the eyes of Stephen Ferris. Is there any particular reason why the punishment is so lenient? Im not suggesting 20 weeks or anything (I understand that there are relatively few NFL games a season), but 1 game seems extremely lenient no?
I dont get it. Talib gets one game for poking someone in the eye, an act that could end someones career if the retina was affected and Stedman Bailey gets 4 games for smoking some maryjane... NFL GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER!!!
Was he also fined? Do you lose out on pay when suspended?
Can it please be two games?
What bout Von, he was starting shit that led to this. Then decides hes going to crush another dudes neck because he was held.

Dude gets away with so much shit but hes a golden boy on /r/nfl and /r/DenverBroncos  . At least Lions fans admitted Suh was dirty. 
I assume he'll appeal and get it overturned.
I'm gonna wait for someone From ESPN or NFL to confirm this  
EDIT [Confirmed, and He Deserved it TBH](https://twitter.com/AdamSchefter/status/663815530407587840)
what a joke, one fucking game? he has prior incidents...
Funny how they tried to suspend Saints players for an entire year for allegedly attempting to injure someone, when they give this a guy one game for getting caught on camera doing just that. But yet, that whole thing wasn't a witch hunt. Bring on those downvotes. 
Not nearly enough.

He should have been ejected and suspended for more than one game. 

Hope the Broncos extend his suspension for a couple more games at least.
THATS IT? A GUY WITH ANGER ISSUES AND HISTORY OF ASSAULT GETS 1 GAME?!?! But he didn't hurt "The integrity of the game", so I guess theres that
Expected a single game suspension, but after hearing all the bullshit he's come out with after the game I would have loved to see at least 2 games.
Figured it was coming, and it's a fair punishment. Learn from it and don't let your emotions get the better of you.
To some extent, justice has been done. Should have been more in my opinion. You don't fuck with another man's vision.

Sorry Denver fans, I know it's a big loss to your D, but you have to realise how scummy this human being is.
Good. I've always liked Talib but what the hell man
I'm sure he thinks he did nothing wrong
He suggested that Allen was "milking" the injury. I'm trying to think of a good dairy related pun, but I cannot. 
Good. What a shitty thing to do. Hope he loses the appeal. 
Good.  No question it was intentional.
YES! This means our receivers will be open when Alex Smith decides to scramble
Good, he deserves it.
Captain Insano shows no mercy
How are you going to give him a suspension for that and two guys at the beginning of the season were slamming other players helmets into the ground 
Justice is in fact blind.
The NFL.  Where cheating doesn't get you suspended, trying to blind someone gets you one game, and beating your SO is acceptable until the photos are released.  Keep it classy Goodell.
Eye was able to see this suspension poking around the corner a finger away.
Suspend him for the fucking Patriots game. 
Now waiting for fleets of bronco fans saying "It wasn't so bad" "Pacman Jones blahblahblah"
This is extremely helpful for us, just unfortunate for the colts that he didn't get immediately ejected along with Von Miller
Not even close to enough.
[deleted]
[Talib was just trying to act out his favourite movie Waterboy] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT4IMWzRvsk)
The world is just and fair
jk jk
But he was just going to poke him in the head and his hand slipped!!

Give me a break, what a dirty play. If this suspension doesnt stand then NFL players will know they have free game out there on the field.
Why the fuck didn't Pacman get suspended then?
Captain Insane-O shows no mercy

A little light in my opinion. There is no way that it wasn't pre-meditated. Poking someone in the eye takes days, if not weeks of planning to pull off. Hopefully the NFL takes this more seriously and investigate it further.
Dummy. Really lost his cool out there and made a bit of an ass out of himself. Didn't own it after the game either 
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
[Captain Insano shows no mercy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT4IMWzRvsk)
He showed his Patriot side with that dirty move. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBTSugoc6rM
Suspended a game for a finger poke? This league is SOFT. /s
Has there been an uptick in this type of behavior over the last few seasons or is just a change in the way the media is covering it?
For those keeping score, deliberately poking a man in the eye is 1/4 as bad as maybe knowing that someone might have tampered with footballs.
The only jayhawk I have a hard time rooting for
I'm going to bet locker room is more likely - I can't imagine he wants to have NBC cut to a shot of him in the booth every 5 minutes. 
‚ô´ *Locker room you feel so warm.* ‚ô´
It is that time of the year when the elderly need to be kept as warm as possible
‚ô´ Losing feeling in my toes.
"I really can't play,"

"Peyton, it's cold outside"
Can someone take that gif of Russell Crowe where he's peeking through the window and replace it with Manning?
We don't have to watch the "manningface on the sideline" show?

Awesome.
In the booth? Is he starting his new career today? 
When I first saw "booth", I thought this meant Peyton would be joining Al and Chris in the SNF booth for the game.

Which would probably be cooler. Well... warmer for him. Because of the cold. 
if he commentates, i would be ok with that. 
[The locker room is actually a pretty nice setup.](https://i.imgur.com/ELIrAze.jpg)
It'll be cool if he's got a radio in the booth. 

It's so flipping beautiful out right now!
Wow, he *really* doesn't like the snow, huh?
[soft](http://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2402706/soft.0.gif)
Just a warning: Don't read the replies to this tweet if you like peyton. It's pretty brutal :(
Osweiler gets knocked out on the first play.  Peyton comes out of the tunnel and enters into one of the greatest QB shootouts of all time with Brady, for their final matchup.

I know this won't happen and it saddens me that we've probably already seen their last head to head.
Over/under how many times this gets brought up during the game 
If he doesn't commentate, I hope someone secretly mics him up for the game.
Why did you add the letter 'c' to old?
And if someone opens the door and lets the cold air in, Old Man Peyton is gonna be real angry!
I'm sure it's part this, and part they don't want him to be a distraction. This is Brock's team now until Peyton's healthy.
I thought he was like the third string qb? "Manning get dressed quick while we're on commercial break!"
Still a better commentator than Joe buck
The world is a harsh place. Until very recently he was a great player - his decline has been very sudden but I think he deserves a lot more respect than he is receiving here and I am not even a fan !!
My grandpa does the same. Hates the cold. Loooooves bakersfield.
[Every Time they cut to Peyton](http://i.imgur.com/mj4L9uN.gif)
Will he or will he not be wearing gloves? 
Peyton is going to be busy filming Nationwide commercials throughout the stadium. 
&gt;Peyton will be in the locker room or in the booth during the game

This will probably be true for the rest of his involvement with the NFL.
Maybe it's time Elway takes Ol Yeller to the barn
ITT: ManningFace 

Damn you guys!
This makes me wonder: he's pretty solid in commercials and is obviously knowledgable about football. Maybe his future is in the booth or in the studio. I have a laundry list of people I would love to see him replace. 

Either way I'm almost positive he's done. I don't see him having another resurgence a la Favre. 
Wow, a lot of negative comments. I think the guy has earned it.  While I wouldn't sit in the locker room there's no reason he can't be in the booth. He could probably offer up some good insight up in the booth looking at the game from above

I've heard he's told people he wants one more year. I really hope he does well up in the booth and finally realizes it's time to hang it up. He's old and had major surgery, he's a ticking time bomb on the field. 

He would have a job the same day in a coaching role, I don't see many teams even looking at him as a player. 
They should have him in the announcers booth.
As if he couldnt feel more old. Jesus.
He doesn't want the constant negative camera attention
Cold as in the weather or cold as in he's sick?
Beginning of the end.
Make him stand on the sidelines like every other player wtf
*Nothing beats an empty room*
I would love to see Peyton stick around in management positions. He's such a likable guy, and it'd be the first player that I grew up watching all the time to move into other roles in the NFL. My parents are always talking about the players they grew up watching being on coaching staff and commentating so that would be pretty cool.
lol if youre trying to convince people that youre injured and not just too old too play, it doesnt inspire a lot of confidence when you stay inside because the weather doesnt look nice. 
I hope he makes it to his bingo game on time. 
So what was his excuse last week? Peyton is a bullshitter to say he can't help out Osweiler. He just refuses to help someone who is basically his replacement. Petty bullshit. 
Peyton needs to retire, go home and sing his little stupid jingles.  ~nationwide is on your side~
So key question...

Over/under on close-up shots of Peyton in the booth during the broadcast?
Holy shit Wing --&gt; Harris


So much &lt;3
That is a sad man 
This thread is making me laugh after this afternoon's shit show. 
Just retire already
This is almost sad
What a lady. 
Why is this news?
There's always bocce ball. 
Great career but it's time to hang up the cleats
So many Manning face pics in here.  I fucking love it!
Manning has definitely checked out if he can't even be assed to join the team on the field.
So who is the Broncos backup? What happens if Brock gets injured early? Backstage cameras showing Peyton getting dressed followed by a WWE entrance. That's what I'm thinking
i dot blame him slightly less attention and its warm up and theres food ? lol 
Peyton is like the grandma you have to keep warm
He's out with a foot injury and most likely retiring after this season. What is this bullshit regarding his whereabouts since last Sunday?
Peyton...do everyone a favor and retire..you're only making it worse. You had a Hall of Fame career..no need to leave on this note. 
Peyton Manning is an old crotch.
ballsiest and best decision irsay ever made was letting this pansy non-leader go.
How mad would Peyton be if right when he went to sit down Ty Law picked up his chair and ran away with it?
Peyton's like an injured horse that can't walk.  What you need to do is take it out back and shoot it, but in reality someone like Peyton needs to retire. 
"Payton will enter the stadium in his own Pope mobile to thwart even the slightest chance that our plebian breath would soil his perfect body."
Poor old man. Make sure he gets his heated blanket and hot chocolate.
thats some soft shit
If he can't even sit on a sideline in cold weather what makes him think he can play in cold weather? God I'm sick of this guy

wow, seriously?

you get paid a LOT of money to put up with the cold to show leadership to your team mates...
So... Payton will stay inside while other quarterbacks play out in the cold and weather? Old news.
Living in Indiana, I honestly think I was the only "Colts fan"  to see him leave, yeah he was good for us every REGULAR season.. But he's a pussy who always shits the bed. Luck turns it over every other possession but at least he fights for every inch and just doesn't lie down... Oh and I put quotations around Colts fans because I feel 98% of Colts fans here in Indiana are terrible and don't know shit about football or can't even name more than 5 players on the squad... Whoa ok sorry kinda off subject but had to get it off my chest
Does he have a cold or is it just cold outside?
[deleted]
ESPN already told us we're getting that guy from Bama. Also Chip Kelly is going to The U and Philip Rivers will be a Titan for the 2015 season.
HE NEVER SAID NO, FIRE UP THE RUMOR MILL
But logically shouldn't he coach Chicago first? Then the Colts, then Baltimore, then the Chargers.

"One dumpster fire was enough, stop asking".

-Jim Harbaugh
HARBAUGH!

SABAN!

GRUDEN!

COWHER!


Yeah, you can shut the fuck up.  He just got here. 
"But what about Saban?" "Oh he's taking it for sure."
I'm sorry Jim, but you are going to be a rumored HC front runner every single year until you finally come back to the NFL. Better get used to the question.
The narrative that Harbaugh has a shelf-life and never stays more than 4 years is pretty much donkey balls.

Consider:

San Diego:  coached there 3 years, turned them around. Left to take the job at Stanford. Why?  Because Stanford is a power 5 conference team and a raise from whatever he was getting a USD

Stanford:  coached there 4 years, turned them around. Left to take the job at San Francisco. Why?
Because the Niners were at the time an attractive NFL opportunity and a drastic raise from $1.25 mill/year to  $5 mill/year. 

SF:  coached there 4 years, turned them around. Left to take the job at Michigan.  Why?  Because Jed York and because he's essentially a deity at Michigan who can name his pricetag, coaching staff and the color of chrome on his parking lot 'Reserved' sign.

The narrative that Harbaugh burns out after 4 years is horseshit.  The only case where he left a job because of personality conflicts was San Francisco and I'm willing to bet every Niner fan here will be all too happy to unload on Jed York's part in that fallout.  He left USD and Stanford for reasons that *every coach in America* would've left.


he is ours now. fuck off.

 sincerely, a michigan fan

While I believe he's a great NFL coach, I hope he stays in college. He's best in an environment where he's the king and everybody in the building answers to him. Few NFL owners are willing to give away that level of control. His intensity also wears people down. So the 4-year eligibility rule and the resulting turnover is perfect for him and his players.
Is Pagano definitely gone after this season? It seems a bit premature to assume that they won't offer him a  new contract. I don't know how likely it is either.
This was a dumb question in the first place. He may come back to the NFL eventually, but not right now. Not for a few years at least.
Shit. We broke him in SF. Everything that once was, shall fall to ruin once we have touched it. 
Harbaugh won't leave Michigan for a long time.
I miss seeing those loud khakis 
People just don't seem to understand that a guy would want to stay in a college job when an NFL opportunity presents itself.  Do you know why coaches hardly ever voluntarily leave at Texas, Michigan or Georgia?  Because the schools are in Austin, Ann Arbor, or Athens.  Just fantastic college towns where the quality of live is awesome, the cost of living is low, and co eds.
Stay away, he's ours now

I think hes got a god damn good thing goin on in MI. First hear success, widespread fame. He is khaki Jesus to the UM fans up here.
Dear God, please keep that asshole Harbaugh out of the NFL. Thank you.
It's stupid to ask him about any job since he's been at Michigan less than a year.

It's offensive to ask him about a job that isn't even open.
If anything we'll end up with Chundzinski
god damnit I forgot which one is which again can they just change their fucking names for god sakes.  its like i'm asking for something here
Harbaugh: STOP FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MY PENIS CAN ONLY GET *SO* ERECT.
Would love to see him back in nfl! 
Sounds like a maybe to me. 
Guys I just saw Harbaughs wife buying a house in Indy!!! It's confirmed
Im pretty sure he could have the Lions job if he wanted...

- Michigan State fan
Comeback Kid!
The "Doug Buffone" response 
Is he about to Lane Kiffin UM?
Any more news from the "No shit" file?
I hope in any one on one interview he does, he asks upfront if they're going to ask him about any NFL job opening or potential to return to the NFL so that they'll have to lie, say no, and then later ask him so he can call them out as a liar.
Weird, I say the same thing to my friends when they talk about Harbaugh coaching here.
Haha, hilarious

I bet he wants nothing to do with the NFL now
He stays at a place 4-5 years then moves on. He's been doing that since he was a little kid, through his playing career, and into his coaching career. Nothing will change, ask about NFL jobs in 2018.
and its questions like that ,that make fans hate reporters.
Don't see him leaving his job at Ohio state

Edit: Michigan. Oops

The schools are basically the same anyways
I wonder if Harbaugh will regret taking the Michigan job so early as opposed to waiting for the Colts job to open up. I mean..I expect Harbaugh to win a few championships with Michigan, but nothing compares to winning Superbowls. 
he would be a perfect match in the colts job 
Fuck yeah snow game!
[Hype](https://usatthebiglead.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/calvin-johnson-face-full-of-snow.gif?w=1000)
This morning it was six, now it's ten. According to my calculations, at this rate, there should be around forty inches of snow by game time.
Remember, this is just one model. But it at least gives somewhat of a range. Don't count on it snowing 10 inches just yet. Another model only shows 3 inches of snow for Denver (that model can be seen here http://i.imgur.com/lomtIhe.png).

Also don't count on national weather outlets to be calling this snow (such as weather.com, wunderground.com etc. etc.) for at least another few hours as these models just came out within the last few hours with another run being done as we speak for the NCEP NAM (should be done in about 30 minutes, ill update this comment when that one is done).

As for timing, [according to this metrogram model](http://weather5280.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/gfs-meteograms/12z/kden/2m-temp-precip-meteogram/tmp2m_precip.png?1448741769428) it should start snowing around 12pm/1pm MT with the heaviest being about 4-7p MT (game time is 6:30 MT) and stopping at about 10pm MT. 

If you wanna look at these models yourself, they can be viewed here: http://www.weather5280.com/models
Doubtful it will be that much....it never is 
It's Colorado. For all we know nothing will happen 
I know Brady is good in snow but I love snow games. 
Snow game.

Touch?

Tackle!
This is fantastic news for someone like me who would love to go to this game, but doesn't want to spend a fortune on a ticket.  Looks like they're already down to $90.  I'll gladly pay 50 for an upper and 100 for a lower.  Come on snow!  I also want to hear Belichick rant about the weather reports.
Now don't be pussies and reschedule.
Aww yeah. Brady in a blizzard.
This is gonna be amazing
Why would you lie about this? 
Look at the forecast hour and the valid date. This is a model forecast for total accumulated snowfall over 234 hours until 11pm mountain time on Dec 7th. So the GFS is predicting &lt;10.5 inches of snow over a week.

If you look at the high resolution models for tomorrow, it's predicted to be less than 2 inches, with an inch of that falling during the game.

Just a reminder that predicting weather with the Rockies right to our west is always hard. 
If true, which team does it help more and why?
where are you getting this info from?  The NCEP GFS looks to be more of a climatological model result.

for the record, the forecast for denver is 30% chance of precipitation, and perhaps 1 to 3 inches of accumulation, for tomorrow.
Sports Authority underwent a huge field renovation this past off season as part of their move to an all-natural grass field. They improved drainage and have over 20 miles of pipe and tubing as part of heating system that should keep the field relatively clean. 
Awesome. 
Local weather stations calling for up to only an inch/a trace amount. 

10 inches is 100% not going to happen. In the mountains yes, at the stadium? No.
This is a 234 hour forecast, not for tomorrow night. Also, the GFS. 
Damn. As good as Brady is in the snow, I don't think we have enough receivers to fully capitalize on this. Should still be fun to watch though. 
Every weather report I'm looking at says up to an inch... not sure where the 10.5" are coming from but whatever it is, my seats are under cover
Awesome. Primetime snow game! The weather really makes it anyone's game.
Gost needs his snow game to cement his legendary status 
No it doesn't show up to 10.5 inches for tomorrow's game. It shows 10.5 inches through the next 234 hours. That's why it says "Forecast Hour:234". Also, the 18z run backed way off.
How accurate are weather predictions for Denver?  For Chicago, you can't trust any prediction more than 8 hours in advance.
Literally as I clicked on this the weather person on the news said we'll get 1".

edit: I'm in Denver.
I'm so glad I pushed my return flight to Monday.  This is going to be epic.
DRAFTKINGS CODE: Snow3
[10.5 inchs of snow huh?](http://imgur.com/K9fGRWc)
YESSSSSS
This model fucks my house in particular. 
its really nice out right now, I'm afraid for tomorrow
this is some bull.... i want 10 inches of snow here not there! give me snow!
At this rate we're gonna have about 36 inches of snow on the ground
I guess it never snows in Denver 
weird why does all the news say like its supposed to be cold but clear?
Current forecast has 1-3" possible tonight for Denver area, hourly forecast says 90% chance &amp; most of it between 6-11pm --temp around 21 at gametime. My guess is flurries maybe a few squalls during the game.  
ITS ABOUT FUCKIN TIME THERE WAS A SNOW GAME 
I hope so. crazy snow games are the best.

that eagles lions game a couple years ago was amazing
Awesome. Manning can't play in the col‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ah shit. 
FUCK YEEEAH
Hell yeah!! snow games are the best.
i am sure they will reschedule the game.
oh man I'm so excited for this game
I hope the Pats flight can't leave and Brady has a sleep over with Peyton. They can watch game film and eat ice cream together.
so we'll end up with a light dusting?
FUCK YES!! GAME OF THE SEASON RIGHT HERE!
"If revenge is a dish best served cold, then put on your Sunday finest. It's time to feast!"
I lived in Colorado for a couple years and remember the weather guys going bezerk about a huge snow storm expected to drop over a foot of snow overnight.  I wake up the next morning, it's a sunny day with 0 snow on the ground.  Who fucking knows.
what you think, lafell leading all receivers?
If they cancel this game.....
Doesn't that mean the game might get rescheduled? :/
Holy fuck, is should be a fun one. Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
Why? Did the Pats sign Sam Hurd?
I'm from Atlanta where it's still 60-70 degrees every day, and I flew all the way to Denver for the game. We see "snow" (quarter inch at most) about once every 5 years in GA. I'm excited and terrified at the same time. 
Just my damn luck i flew out of Denver this week to someplace warm.
What do economists and metrologists have in common? Both do it with models
These are the Rockies. 
Where are the models?

Oh.
Giselle isn't a meteorologist.
There's no snow, and forecast shows for none.
I don't know where this 10.5" is coming from, everything I am seeing is saying around 3". Which could me a light dusting for out here. 

I can't tell if this a map of all of Colorado or just a part of it. 
Brady threw 5 TD's in one quarter in a snow game. Prepare your anus. Snow is his yellow sun.
[deleted]
BRING YOUR WORST DENVER
Best news I've heard all week. My faith is restored
Local meteorologists are predicting ~3 inches as of saturday night. They tend to be more accurate than the models.
brady is a monster in the snow. 


IIRC he has never lost a game in the snow. in a game thats looking like it will come down to the wire, ill take whatever edge we can get
and they're still selling for 400+ bucks for bloody nose section.  that being said, the elevation alone makes even sideline seats bloody nose section.
Which team is less worse in the snow? 
That's one happy Ygritte. 
I think the snow benefits NE. I hope it pours. If the snow doesn't hit I honestly think NE wins (or at least covers the spread). But if it comes down to minimizing mistakes in the snow, hard to go against Brady vs Brock and BB and his situational preparedness's 
I think this snow definitely benefits the patriots.
There is something magical about football being played in the snow.

Too often anymore, Football is played in sterile, perfect little domes, on sterile, perfect little surfaces, so that everyone can get perfect, maximum stats and increase their leverage for contract money.  And fantasy football only feeds into the need for perfect stats.

But what if the playing field weren't perfect?  What if the conditions changed?  How would your team adapt?  How would they overcome?  It is in how they adapt and overcome that tales of lore and stories of old come into being.  That makes us fans, and makes us love the players on our team in the special manner for the way they do overcome and adapt.  Plus, playing in snow is the signal that hearkens us back to our younger days playing outside in the snow.

We have 2 late season divisional games this year to close it out, @ MIN and home vs DET.  Both are in late December, when snow is expected to come rolling in.  I hope it snows so fucking hard you can't see the yard markers on the field.


Bad weather? Better check the PSI of those balls! 

Mostly /s
I know I'm in the minority here, but I really dislike weather having a large impact on the game and feel every game should be played in a dome. Sure it might lend itself to some displays of out of the ordinary and interesting game plays, but it really detracts from the competitive nature of the game and makes it really sloppy.
[deleted]
ITT Raiders fans being triggered by the snow
It's the holiday season baby lets gooooo I love it
Thank you based weather gods.
I FUCKING LOVE SNOW GAMES!!! 
Brock should cover himself in snow and play as a monster. 
Is their any precedent for a game being cancelled due to weather?
Guess I'm wearing snow pants tomorrow
Brady only throws for 250 to WRs signed off practice squad
In Detroit we just let people wander into Ford Field to get out of the cold. 
yeah cuz the roles are now reversed

they're a dumpster fire and we've got the most excitement surrounding us since forever




We also have a tarp covering the section that would normally be our cheapest seats. 
So people aren't eager to drive out to Santa Clara to watch Blaine Gabbert quarterback their team? Go figure.
That's outrageous...especially since the Niners are the ones with the shiny new stadium. 
idk it only cost 20 more dollars to go to a colts games. I could fly to Indianapolis get a hotel and it would still be cheaper than the broncos next home game

edit: holy shit my mistake, the REDZONE RALLY PASS is 54 bucks but the cheapest tickets are 34 holy shit. Thats like good seats price for a rockies game
As much as I don't like any division rival the Raiders have a loyal fan base so I can imagine they are turning out in full force this year.
Secondary market though, you can usually get Raiders season tickets as low as $250 for the entire year.
Well let's see do you want to watch:

Blaine Gabbert or Derek Carr?

Khalil Mack or the ghost of Navarro Bowman?

Phil Dawson or Seabas?

I actually look forward to Raider games more than Niner games at this point. Jed York and his entire family should be embarrassed. 

This is great for Oakland and their hopes of getting a new stadium. As we saw with Santa Clara it's a lot easier to convince a city to build a stadium if your team is winning. Thankfully for Oakland I don't think Mark Davis is about to pull the rug out from under them if they get a stadium. 
Dang, I don't even like the 49ers, but I live close by so I might drop $40 to go see them play the Bengals.
Good. Starve the beast.
This is the perfect testament to Jed York's foolishness. 
Awesome. I hope this continues as long as York and Baalke continue to destroy this franchise and scapegoat everyone else but themselves. 
It's the demand of a fan base ready for a good team. I sold my panthers tickets tomorrow for three times fave value and that's without even posting them. 
TIL 49ers tickets are roughly the same price as Coyotes tickets. That's pretty sad.
Tickets to a game at Levi's are now cheaper than a pair of Levi's. 
I have a friend (49er fan since I've known him) who has already jumped on the Raiders bandwagon.  I have a feeling it will be like 2011-2013 with the roles reversed and everyone in the bay is a Raiders fan.
That's because if you live in SF, getting to Oakland is far far far easier than getting to Santa Clara.
I don't go because it's far as fuck and I don't want to get stabbed by mexican gangsters. 
Send the 9ers to LA!
One of the only benefits of being a 49ers fan this season
I mean, you saw they're starting Blaine Gabbert, right? Do you wanna pay to see that when you can watch it at home instead? 
The funniest thing to me about Levis stadium, is that the Oakland Coliseum is closer to SF than Levis stadium.  
Lololololololol the techies jumping that wagon hard
How is the Oakland Stadium? 
I just went to the bronco vs raider game

I paid 210 a ticket for 2nd row on the 50

I doubt you can get in Santa Clara 
Sucks to suck
What is the price of apples compared to the price of oranges?
It feels good to know that us Raider fans put up with all the shit talking year after year after year and it finally is being dished out the other way.
Clearly people will pay for a safe environment to watch football. 
Doesn't Oakland cover like 2000 seats in the upper deck? Bet they won't do that next year if they are still playing in Oakkand. 
The Steelers are playing the Raiders today, their fans always travel well, that could explain the price for today's game. 
Fuck, wouldn't it be something if somehow the Raiders get to play in the Super Bowl at Levi's this year.
It's amazing how much the matchups seemto matter. I was looking at Texans tickets on the offchance I can make it down to visit my folks this season. Tickets to Pats @ Texans are 150+. Jags @ Texans? 40 bucks
As a Bills fan I can only hope that people start to realize that building an inaccessible downtown stadium here will bring a similar cost to business along with it.

No one locally is interested is using public transportation to go to a game and the population density here does not support it. Furthermore cities that have decent infrastructure still have issues. Practical fans are not interested in that.
Is this why all the 49ers games are empty?
I went to the Bengals week one game when I was on holiday (from the UK) in September, paid about ¬£100 for two tickets through the Ticket Exchange, so it worked out very similar to the Wembley games and I didn't really bat an eyelid. 

It was certainly preferable to hop on the BART to Oakland rather than somehow work out how to get 40 miles out of SF with no car.
Wow. How the roles have reversed. Will be in Bay area for the Thursday night game between the Chargers and Raiders. Super excited about this. :)
Thank god for the Kraft family :D
what a time to be alive
Excellent. Hit ownership where it really hurts- the wallet.
I saw the game listed as Steelers vs Raiders, isn't the home team usually listed second? I don't live in the USA, so I'm a bit out of touch.
All the bandwagoners crossing the bay at this rate is gonna cause the next "big one".
Well yeah. The cheapest seats in Levi's are actually just sun tan chairs 
Bay Area bandwagons are ridiculous. 
Just to be clear, using StubHub isn't quite fair since 49ers are essentially forcing their season ticket holders to list on NFL Ticket Exchange. Lowest price there right now (a few hours before the game) is $62 for one seat, the rest start at about $85. 

In addition, the Raiders game is over a week away, and anyone who knows anything about the secondary market knows that prices drop as you get closer to the game, especially in the last few days. 

This disparity is real, the Raiders are a much bigger draw than the shitstorm of my 49ers are, but it's not THIS big. 
I once bought 10 Rams tickets for under $100
What in the fuck
Must be nice to live in St. Louis. Cheap tickets for every home game.
well duh
RAIIIIIIIDERRRRRRRRS!
...and the natural order is restored.
Cuz they know they can recoup their money at the casino down the street!
And if that doesn't work,  you'll get robbed on the way back to your car.
Well, Raiders fans need a way to spend all that drug money.  I kid, I kid....
I was behind a Packers fan at the Georgia Dome will call, arguing with the clerk about how much Falcons tickets cost.
This makes me sad because I am going to be in the bay area next weekend and was looking to go to a game but the niners are on a bye...damn, I guess time to scour stubhub. 
niners and their bandwagon fans, smh.  
This probably has a whole lot to do with Steelers playing in Oakland this Sunday while Atlanta plays the Santa Clara Gabberts. Steelers fans are everywhere.
This makes me happy in the pants.
Soon to become the San Jose 49ers.
Did the Warriors make Oakland cool again for the techies?
Dion joins Charles, Foster, and Bell in the RB graveyard
I'm so sad. The dude worked so hard. Amazing how he came outta nowhere. 

Check out this tweet from Rapoport:

"A month ago, #Patriots RB Dion Lewis signed a 2-year deal worth up to $5M. That looms large now. Never would‚Äôve gotten it coming off an ACL"

Glad the dude got his money. He deserved it. 
I feel worse for Lewis than the loss of him for the team. Guy worked through some real injuries for his chance.
Someone needs to sacrifice a goat to the injury Gods or something.
This season has been running back-mageddon
fuck sakes.

well hope white and bolden can step up.

622 yards in 7 games played. That's a big shoe for someone else to fill.
This is so upsetting. Lewis was literally my favorite player to watch on the field this season.  He always juked and broke ankles when he got the ball and made some amazing plays this season :'(
That really sucks.  He was so exciting to watch and a really big part of that offense.
That's rough. At least he got his name out there and won't have to worry about finding a roster spot once he comes back. 
Damn that really sucks Pats fans, I really enjoyed watching him this year. Hoping for a fast and full recovery.
Man, Fuck ACL injuries
But but we just feel in love with him a few weeks ago?

(‡≤¢_‡≤¢)
gee dang it :( :( :( :( :( :( get well soon lil dirty. so bummed, not just for the team but him personally. he finally got a real shot in the NFL :(
The Patriots just can't catch a break
I feel for him. I tore my left ACL a few years back, and my right ACL on Saturday. Only one way to go and that's onward. 
Really glad he signed that contract extension when he did. Good for him on that front. Especially when people said he could have gotten more. 
Even though he plays for a rival, I enjoy him as a player. Whenever I'd see him on the field, it seemed like he was always putting in effort to make a play or slip out of tackles. 

Hope he's back and ready to go next year.
Man, that really sucks. 
The all acl team is Super Bowl worthy.
[Fuck](http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/imported_assets/2199827/lie-down-try-not-to-cry-cry-a-lot.jpg)
WHAT IN THE FUCK.

I swear we lose half the team to injury in the games we weren't ever going to lose in the first place, it gives me palpitations when we have Brady in up 30 now.
If you're a running back in the NFL, stop what you're doing and run away while you still have two working knees
üòÇüî´
Dammit. He was a lot of fun to watch. Injuries suck. 
Poor guy, he was pretty much a no name and was able to make himself a huge part of our offense. This really hurts.
I am REALLY REALY bummed out for Dion Lewis. He was given a shot and he absolutely fucking ran with it, and was incredibly fun to watch. That being said, I'm not worried about this in the grand scheme of things for the Pats. 

If I had to pick one position to have the Patriots lose a player at, it'd probably be RB. They always seem to make it work, no matter who they have. I think they may not even look at getting another RB and will add some depth to OL. 

Again, really sucks for him and I had an absolute blast watching him play. But the Pats will be just fine. 

Son of a bitch
Wooooooow :(
The patriots are going to find some guy working at a car dealership to rush for 500 yards total in the playoffs anyways and it'll surprise no one
Nooooooooooooooo :'(
All these RBs, damn.
It's a shame Pierre Thomas signed with the 49ers a week ago. He would've been a good replacement.
I'm just glad that he already signed his extension. 
Yeah that's what it looked like. Even when patricia came up to hug/talk to him that seemed like a bad sign
Feel sorry for Dion, it was like this for him in Philadelphia as well.  Would be super impressive when he was healthy, but those moments proved to be too fleeting to keep him on the 53 man team.  Glad he got paid earlier this year though.
This is my fault guys. I was talking about getting Lewis' jersey with my friends during the first quarter.
Well that sucks I really like this guy. I hope James White can step up
Lewis is one of those backs that just always runs like he got shot out of a cannon.  sucks to see this, at least he signed that extension.
And you know what?  They'll plug someone else in who'll still be able to rush for 80-120 yards a game.
Well lucky for them, they always keep a spare for each running back that they use.  Belichick has a clone for each of his starting running backs, now we just have to see if there is any degradation between the generations of clones. 
Welp, good thing we are 8-0. 12-4 or 13-3 is still well within reach which might be good for a first round bye depending on the Denver game and the final record of Denver and the Bengals. 

I hope he heals just fine. No life long complications. 
Belichek will still have him listed as questionable for next week. 
Dion Lewis was rapidly becoming my favorite player. When I saw the injury I was absolutely crushed, this sucks! Not only is he a dynamic and massive piece in our offense, he's also just an incredibly great guy overall. 

Screw injuries man. 
Well, that's shitty
Bubble wrap all of the running backs!

And man, that sucks for him.  He was having a solid year.
Ouch, that really sucks, for him and for the team. Glad he signed his extension when he did, kid deserves the security. I don't have a lot of faith in James White, so just have to hope to be proven wrong there, and also hope that we'll see a signing shortly (Travaris Cadet? Dri Archer?)
heal up Dion,

Hope you're ready to go for next season. 
[(‡≤¢_‡≤¢)](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--XmMrLZ6c--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/bydhzbqgn5p11s3x0sqh.gif)
TAKE MINE! I HAVE TWO KNEES! I OFFER MYSELF FOR TRIBUTE!
Ok here's the thing. I know this sounds bad, but I was waiting for him to have a non-contact injury all year long. He runs like a mad man. ACLs are not made of steel. It was gonna happen eventually. Also, this isn't the end of the world. I loved having him play, but he isn't vital to our offense. If this was a guy like Gronk, Edelman, or Brady, then I would be freaking out. Losing Lewis does not put our season in jeopardy whatsoever. It can ALWAYS be worse. Our offense will be just fine I promise you (as long as we don't lose any more offensive linemen).

*Why the downvotes? Our offense does not rely on Lewis. He was just an added weapon.*
Bad year to be a running-back it seems.
That just sucks so much. He came in with a chance to prove himself and did just that. Just brutal.
I'm guessing this means Travaris Cadet is coming back.
God dammit. Why is every RB getting injured!! 
Hate to see that happen; he was doing great
Fucking football, man. Endless goddamn injuries.
Stop with the ACL's this season. I think we've had at least 1 per week
Cant be overstated how important he was for us going undefeated til now. Those screen passes to Lewis have been deadly and we don't have someone similar to replace him.
It speaks volumes reading the comments here about what kind of player he's proven himself to be.  So nice to see all the well wishes and overall positivity towards the guy, it really shows what sporting is all about (or should be).
Daaaaaaaaamn. Out of football, finally able to get his career on track, and now this. Poor Dion...
I am so many levels of sad right now

He finally finds a home then, poof, injured again
Fuck.

Good for him that signed an extension before he got hurt at least.
Bummer not just for what he does for us on offense but even more so how much he has done to get to this point. The dude was overlooked and an inopportune injury early in his career meant he had to wait until now to get a shot. And he repayed the Pats for that tenfold with his play this season. Only to have it snatched away. 

Get better soon bud. We'll miss you out there. Can't wait to see you back on the field.
Such a great story too.  Given that 2 year extension and was so damn appreciate of everything.  Ugh this sucks for him.  Hopefully he can recover and still be effective next year.
When you think about it, he runs kind of the same way Derrick Rose used to run/attack the basket (which imo is a big reason he injured himself so frequently). 
God dammit, we won the damn lottery with Lewis, this is one hell of a loss. He makes our offense so much fun to watch, can't wait to see him back next year. 
I'm so glad we signed him to that extension early. He is such a great player and great presence on our team. Get well soon Dion.
He just signed a 2 yr deal - smart thinking Dion !! 
Bummed for Lewis, but man, those non-contact ACL tears are just the worst.

(That we can even categorize them according to contact says a lot about the seeming uptick in ACL tears over the last 10 or so years.)
This guys injuries constantly derail his career. If he didn't get injured so much he would still be either an Eagle or a Brown 
Time for Blount to step up. I have faith in him, he looked great yesterday but losing Lewis is huge.
Breaking news Patriots sign local janitor to play RB and he rushes for 120 yards and 2 TDs in debut 
I just feel bad for the guy. He was having a nice season. Here's to hoping he is comeback player of the year next year! 
Dion Lewis most amazing talent was the 3rd and very long he would convert into a 1st down just by cutting, ducking and shifting past line-backers.
This stinks, and not because it hurts the Pats. I loved seeing a guy who didn't get a shot in some places make the most of his chance with the Pats. Dion is a joy to watch, and one of the most exciting players I've seen in a Pats' uniform. Hopefully he recovers 100% and can enjoy a long and profitable career. 
The All-ACL team doesn't need anymore players! There are tough injuries every season but for some reason this season feels worse, probably just recency bias though
And the rb carousel has started once again. 
He walked off the field and was standing on the sidelines looking fine. Got my hopes up...
Huge loss. I like Bolden but he is not as good as Lewis. Lewis was probably a better scatback than Vereen and Woodhead. 
Sucks to see this happen after Lewis worked so hard to get back this year. My heart goes out to him, and I hope this doesn't discourage him at all. But, as they say, next man up.
Welp whos up to take is spot that can be used similarly?
This is a huge loss, Lewis was killing it
Hold me
i was really rooting for the guy, he was really having an amazing season. I always hear that he's super injury prone, but can someone elaborate? Has he always had major injuries like this?
Dion Lewis is too quick and fast for his own body.
Man, that's tough sledding :(

Didn't he just sign a new deal?
Man this sport is fucking brutal.
Jitterbug got smooshed :(
Sign Hayne, the rugby fella from Australia released by the 49ers 
NOOOOOOOOOO

Not Lil Dirty!
Notable Patriots IR's:  LT Solder, FB Develin, RB Dion Lewis.

We've got a lot of depth in our OL and we have two backs to replace Dion, so i'm not worried whatsoever.  Yes, right now the Pats are thin at OL and have a bunch of starters out, but there's no reason to play them.  The Pats have pretty much already secured a playoff spot given their record, schedule, and the fact that they have Tom Brady.

Putting players in who are at risk of being injured just doesn't make sense.  If i was Belichick i would be very cautious about who i start.  At this point in the season, the Pats going undefeated matters as much as Peyton Manning does in the playoffs.  I'd much rather see a 12-4 team or even 11-5 team go into the playoffs with no more IR's (that's asking way too much this year, though).
Brutal loss, but something tells me New England will find a way to compensate. Their ability to transform replacement-level backs into top performers is unparalleled. 
Next man up
GawdDAMNIT!
... Trent Richardson?
H2P
oof
Sigh
Well that sucks, but "next man up" and off we go.
That contact that he signed looks like it was the best idea he could have had 
NEXT MAN UP
dam dude. 
Jesus, they might have to focus their offense around the pass now. 
Jesus Christ. Will the Patriots even be able to field 22 players by the end of the regular season?
Patriots barely every run the ball so it doesn't really matter for their season. 
Is it too late to trade for Woodhead?
Well fuck
Blounts fantasy value just went up
He was so exciting to watch at Pitt. It is such a shame for this to happen just as he was succeeding in the Pros
Nooooooooo
does it even matter? not for Dion but for the Pats, I mean honestly outside of brady all their parts seem replaceable and they'd still be great
I know fantasy talk is frowned upon here but having Dion on my squad this year has put a highlight on him for me and I am beyond impressed how good the dude is. I wish him the best and hope he comes back just as strong next season.
Belichick will just make someone else.

It's been [two hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3s5ckb/colts_promising_de_henry_anderson_is_believed_to/cx9pg2u) since the last addition.  
doesn't matter Patriots just plug and play at all other positions as long as Brady is playing and Belichek is coaching.
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck!
Well, fuck. That little dude played out of his mind this year. Sucks to see something like this happen to him. He's already gone through a lot to finally have success only to have it stopped short so quickly.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO okay time to step up Brandon Bolden/James White
MOTHERFUCK
Unpopular opinion: Bolden and White will do a serviceable job in his place. The much MUCH bigger issue is our offensive line depth. 
Bummed for Dion, but I'm actually not too worried for the Pats here. James White is a player with similar qualities who I think they'll be able to get some use out of. He's probably not as good as Dion, but it's not like they're suddenly without a slippery pass-catching back. 
Too many injuries this year.  Shame.
Just rip my fucking ACL out and take it injury gods, what the fuck else do you guys want. First you take Brady, then Gronk, and now Lewis. Fuck me. 
In the middle of a call and I get the news and all I say is "god dammit". Panicked. Checked phone. On mute. Thank fuck... but also now... fuck. 
Noooooooooo 
Tough blow, but we still have a good looking RB committee. 

Bill likes to keep 4 RBs though, wonder if the Pats will pick up a FA to turn into the next Jonas Gray.
Damn. It's really sad to see that happen to a bubble player who finally started to catch on. Hopefully he can fully recover and get back to doing what he was doing next year.
He was having such a great season...

Heal up well, Lil Dirty :'(
Was he the player who was hurt with like 45 seconds left in the game? 

I don't remember seeing him get injured. 
Sorry Pats :/ that shit sucks.
Joseph Randle could make a good replacement
JUST
That sucks, hopefully he can recover fully and get back to juking fools next year.

I don't think the offense will take a huge step back from this.  I think the replacement RB is Bolden, who looked fine.  Dion beat him for the starter role but he will be serviceable.  I'm not going to panic with Blount as the starting RB and all of the other starting offensive skill positions are healthy.

I'm more worried about how they will shore up the OL than the RB spot.
FUUUUCKKKKKKKKKK
Ugh, this sucks for Lewis.  The guy earned his shot and had it taken away half way through the season.  Such a bummer for him and my fantasy team.  I hope he comes back next year healthy.
This is why NFL should move back the trade deadline, or make exemptions up until a certain point.
Noooo :(
Damn, *huge* loss. I'm fairly confident in Bolden, but White is an unknown. 



Dion really put our offense over the top though and would have been perfect against defenses like the Broncos. 


Next man up though. Hope Dion heals well. 
Finally, this ought to slow the Patriots down.  [/sarcasm]
Really Tough loss but we won't miss a step. We have a lot of weapons fortunately. Bolden and White can at least be decent I'm sure. 
Fahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhk 
FUCK


Yeah this is real tough news. I mean it just seem like this New England team is stuck in this slump of not winning a Super Bowl in over 10 months. Must be tough. 
God damn it. FUck. next man up i suppose. That guy was so fun to watch.
Fuck it. Next man up, we're the god damn Patriots. 
He will be missed but I think we'll be fine. We have 8 games for bill to find a solid replacement or switch schemes.
Fuck 
Tits Burgers! Thanks for the 8 game magic Little Dirty. 
Fuuuuuck. Lil Dirty just can't get a break. :(
I'm not surprised by this unfortunately. The way he was cutting gave me concern with his knees. I can't understand why ACLs tear this often. Lewis upgraded our offense from last season and it really sucks we lose that advantage when Brady is playing at such an incredible level for his age. I really hope White can step up.
Ray rice
As much as I hate him because he's a Pat, he was sure entertaining to watch
FUCK
Take my legs god!
that's huge
I said it was an ACL when it happened, this is not news to me.

Lord if Eli and Odell can somehow lead that abysmal ass defense to beating the patriots I dont know how everyone will react

This just seems like such a one sided matchup 
[What Eli is really thinking](http://i.imgur.com/byba6.jpg)
Are we gonna sock each other's dicks all the way to gametime? I'm not saying I'm against it.
It's hard to not read this in his accent.
"I got him on the right night once" - Peyton
We are going to lose again aren't we....
[deleted]
I hate Eli and he stole so much happiness from me

He was UNCONSCIOUSLY clutch each of those games. The Manningham catch could not have been a more perfect throw. This dude earned both his rings
I have to give credit to Eli. He played the best football at the right time and took down 2 legends of the game twice. He deserves a tip of the ol' cap.

That said, it's just another game. Brady should go into NY, do his thing against an Amukamara-less defense, have the defense hold, and get the W. No shit-talking or gloating about revenge until after the win, if the Pats do.
I thought I was in a Metal Gear sub for a second, jeeze.
Just bet my friend 10$ the giants will win. Thanks in advance.
Ha. I am gonna be such a Giants fan this Sunday.
Eli is the most unassuming, "aww shucks" QB I've ever seen. He just seems to float through life. I can't hate him, he's just too innocent.
Bae caught me sleeping. 
He said what was right. Didn't overstep any. And he has two rings and admirable bragging rights. And pats fans can say nothing. As pats fan myself, I can say nothing against those two bowls. They beat us and enjoyed the spoils. 
The manning brothers are quite diplomatic.  They know how to play the game and know how to work the crowd without creating a ton of useless drama.
I can't believe this polite, kind, unassuming *motherfucker* is the reason Brady/Belichick don't have 6 goddamn rings. 

Having said that, boo hoo 4 rings. God we're spoiled. 
I'm confused...didn't the Giants lose to the Patriots in the last game of the (perfect) 2007 regular season?  In fact, I know they did.  It was a very close game.
Eli's ambidextrous, he throws just as... oh wait.
If the Pats win against the Giants they will finish the year undefeated. 
Eli&gt;Peyton
Oh, Eli. We all know that every night is the right night when you're on the field. 
I heart my goober QB.
That's so Eli
Any given Sunday. Those losses hurt but they're in the past. If the Giants secondary wasn't a dumpster fire I think this would be a really close game. It seems like people have already forgotten that as bad as he's been this season, Kap put up 265yds and 2 TDs against the Giants. 
Stupid Humble Eli. I'm supposed to hate the guy but he's got that classic Manning class.
Such a belicheck response by Eli. 
If the Pats don't win this game, I'll scream. 
42-0 Patriots.
Eli Manning, the kryptonite to the Patriots hopes and Dreams.
He's being modest. Tom Brady should call the Giants his daddy.
This thread is such a circlejerk, joke thread, *spooky prophecy* from both sides it hurts. Just awful top to bottom. I don't think I saw a single serious comment.
I can hear him say this with his lispy, down-syndrome-y voice. 
Hashtag humility

Um, excuse me, but he didn't catch shit on any of those nights...
[deleted]
I'm assuming it's fine to tackle him by grabbing the hoodie? 
They confirmed that wearing his hoodie is not a violation of the uniform rules.
He usually has that short sleeve turtleneck, dickey-like thing on, so when I saw the hoodie, I thought he was going for an uncircumcised look.  
I love James Jones, his fashion sense is really weird, but it works.  
Are hoodies not popular in every state?
I swear I've seen players wearing hoodies under their jerseys before. I think Stevie Johnson wears light hoodies under his jersey? 
"Cali swag."

Aka, normal wear when the temp drops below 68.  I wonder how much shit he caught for wearing it?  Is he going to have to wear two hoodies in December and January if the Pack has home field?

I can just imagine him waddling through his routes looking like the kid from A Christmas Story.
It's how he smuggled the good luck squirrel into the stadium.
Well, can't argue with that logic.

[James Jones on the Hoodie](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/james-jones-explains-why-he-wore-a-hoodie-underneath-his-uniform-041709337.html)
Jones you're my hero
He was dressed like an eleven year old playing a backyard pickup game
Thought it was glorious

Hoping he catches a ball in it
I'd wear an ugly Christmas sweater under my jersey and roll the jersey sleeves all the way up above my shoulders 
Bill Belichick must have a ton of swag cuz his nickname is "The Hoodie"
I wonder if he will get fined for it. I don't think it's explicitly against the rules, but they won't want everyone doing it. I'd guess a warning and a league wide memo is the result. It's hilarious that he did that though.
A couple of years ago, we had a strech in Wisconsin of sub-zero temperatures. At one point, there was 3 days straight of -70 with howling wind. It was so miserable I wanted to cry, but I couldn't, because your tears would freeze instantly and your eyes would freeze shut.
Teach me how to hoodie

Teach me, teach me how to hoodie
I thought it said Jerry Jones at first and was laughing my ass off because I would totally see him saying that.
Pretty sure the suits in NY will create a rule against this during the offseason.  If it looks cool, the NFL will stamp it out fast!
Cool bunnyhug James!
This is football news? Man who cares.
Anyone that has played football will tell you that this is not "an odd garment".
Can halfway confirm, am from cali but have no swag 
He can't be a true Californian anymore if he calls it "Cali"
If you're from California, you do not call it "Cali" under any means. 
Cali swag= high school. Noted 
I love it when guys go out and have fun and let their personality show.
That's some shit we did in high school.
A link to the past 
Wanted to make a joke about Goodell thinking he looks super fine. 
That's for nothing nfl
It's called "fuck it's cold" swag.

I was in Miami last winter, it was in the 50's one morning and so many jackets and gloves I saw on people.  I was in shorts and a button up, felt great.
Is it bad I actually liked it? 
Because it's cold enough in *Cali* to wear one...  Here in MN we wear shorts with our hoodies.  
District
If you are from here, you know better than to call California "cali". Then again he also seriously used "swag" in a sentence. Is James Jones the Black Justin Bieber?
Can someone explain what the significance of this is? I was expecting something like a pot leaf on the sweatshirt but it seems like this is all literally about how this guy wore a sweatshirt on a cold day. 
He's totally getting fined though right?
ITT redditors just don't get it
Tom Brady did this once I remember. Also got that Cali swag
It's been a subarctic 60 degrees lately... You have to bust out the hoodie...

Hoodie, shorts, and flip flops...

I'm surprised someone who has lived in California calls this place "Cali"

If you must abbreviate it's usually to narrow down your region... Stuff like SoCal, NorCal, the IE, OC
The league I coach in has banned hoodys in game for safety reasons... Getting tackled from behind by the hood can choke a mother fucker hard. 
Confirmed: No Fun League, it will be illegal next year. 
Go Pack Go
You were cold. The game was in Minnesota, you're allowed to admit that it was cold out.
Face Palm
All hail the hood!!
Am Californian, can confirm.
Is he not going to catch a fine for that?  
Referring to California as "Cali" should be punishable by crime, or at least get you kicked out of the state.
This makes him and all Californians sound like douches. What an asshole
anyone have a pic??
he can wear a hoodie but Deangelo Williams can't wear something pink. That's a bit ridiculous, Hoodie where a player can just yank at for a tackle, hurting their neck that's ok but a pink wristband? you're going to far I'm going to have to fine you buddy. 

NFL is weird like that, other leagues like MLB the players are wearing neon green or have their gloves a different color because they used it on their former team. NBA sometimes allow players to have a logo or design on their hair or a message on their sneakers.

It's dumb if you're in the business of running away from people. 
This is how fucking lame all press and post-game interviews have gotten, that a hoodie has made a headline.
No it's not. It's just fuckin' stupid.
How does he underestimate Midwest weather when he played in it his whole career ?
"Cali swag"

r/cringe
Was probably use to wearing it in Oakland to hide his face with how bad he played.
That's fucking teamwork.
So Peyton is basically a second OC while he's not playing. Once he is properly done with playing he's gonna make a hell of a coach.
CURSE YOU [PEYTON!!](http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2014/0504/sn_obiwankenobi_576x461.jpg)
Scumbag move by asking him if he "took Peyton's job"
You can tell Brock was a different person after talking to Manning at halftime http://imgur.com/hihFDfu
That goes against the circle jerk that Manning is pissed at Brock's success though. 
I think Brock hasn't been getting as much credit as he deserves for that win. Our defense has been pretty excellent this year, and he performed under pressure and pulled out the win. I've definitely got my complaints about the reffing, and I think maybe we could walked out with a win if Gronk and Hightower hadn't gotten hurt. However, hypotheticals shouldn't take the attention away from the Broncos and Brock's performance. They had a solid team victory over an undefeated team, and this using a young but apparently very talented young QB. Congrats Broncos.
Peyton should become a HC then a Owner so then he is never away from football
I thought Manning wasn't helping him? 

/s
I have it on good authority that Peyton is going to be the Seahawks' OC next year. I should note that I just made that up.
[Interesting picture they used.](https://nbcprofootballtalk.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/cd0ymzcznguwzdbhnduynddiytjhm2yyzthlmtjjotqwyyznpti4odq3mze0zgnlnta0ytnimwrmmju0m2niodu5mdjl1-e1448895777557.jpeg?w=250)
I can see Brock stepping into the limelight after years of studying under one of the GOATs and being great similar to Aaron Rodgers.
So here's the real question: Having just beaten the undefeated patriots, should Osweiler remain the starter even when Manning is healthy?
class act quarterbacks... we are lucky to have both of them
I love Peyton
the jury is still out on osweiler
Classic good guy Peyton Manning.
I'd be lying if I said I haven't daydreamed about Colts OC Peyton Manning calling Andrew Luck's plays.
And the free victory Papa John's
Because Kubiak doesn't believe in halftime adjustments. 
Also Gary Kubiak. He can turn any QB into a decent to good QB. Have a strong arm and run the bootleg and get your yards. He turn Matt schaub to an elite QB for 2 years and a decent QB for 8 years. 
Coach Manning is here
Manning will eventually win more super bowls as a coach than as a player.
So Peyton was the one who told them to double and triple Gronk? Cool.
Patriots fans high jacking all threads to cry REFBALL!!! Hahahahaha. Can't even congratulate another team on success. Whole coaching staff so angry about your only loss of the season. Better take that chip on your shoulder and win another Super Bowl!!!
maybe he could coach?
Listen Brock I hate your fucking guts. That being said, here's how were gonna attack them in the second half...
This is like one of those cartoons where a hulking giant is controlled by a brilliant but physically incapable character.
Peyton will end up being a great coach if he chooses to do that after he hangs it up. 
Did Manning also pull down his shorts and rub his balls and ass in Osweiler's face? 
OSWEILER and MANNING = MASTER BLASTER.
they say to make your team first, then get your franchise qb. brock is benefiting from an amazing team around him. not a knock on brock, complimenting the organization 
The Broncos like beating undefeated teams, maybe they'll get to play the an undefeated Panthers team in the Super Bowl.
Only after he sat on his face and rubbed his rectum on his "vulgar mouth"
Is ESPN going to run with this as some kind of Peyton Manning vs Kubiak deal? Or a display of Manning being a great teammate? 
But what about the "bad teammate, unhelpful Manning" narrative?
You know it's possible to give Osweiler credit for a well played game while still thinking the refs fucked us on multiple occasions?

Brock came through on some big throws on big drives. No one is taking that away from him (or at least I'm not). He capitalized on the opportunities he was given. Can't hate on that.  

However, that doesn't change the fact that the Pats got fucked on two calls (arguably three) at *extremely* pivotal moments of the game. No one is blaming Brock Osweiler for the officiating. 

I can and will hate on that Gronk OPI and Chung defensive holding though.
Pats fans still salty as fuck lmao. You reap what you sow: your shoulda coulda woulda explanations to everything are null. "The refs, the injuries, the Mannings..."
Nice. 
Evil comment 
i think its crazy how the media has already appointed Osweiler as Manning's replacement. There is a huge chance that Os could still shit the bed and they have to fall back on Manning for the playoffs. 
When Peyton Manning retires I think a College or even NFL team will pick him up as an Offensive Coordinator.
Osweiler seems like a class act
That's really neat. 
He should have credited the refs.
Nice of Cooper to finally contribute to the Manning legacy while Petyon was scarfing down Papa John's and Eli was recovering from the 'Skins. 
After Hightower went out with his injury, Denver's YPC tripled and they scored all 3 rushing TDs.

EDIT: In case you think the volume of plays really had an impact on skewing these stats: With Hightower, the Patriots limited Denver's rushing attack to 15 carries for 43 yards. Without him, the Broncos ran 17 times for 136 yards and three touchdowns.
And refs for 4th quarter comebacks. 
I  can't remember exactly...was it 2 or 3 first downs by penalty on Brock's so-called signature drive that gave him the win over Tom Brady and the Patriots?
Manning is the one who stopped every Pats drive with a flag, and kept every Denver one going with a flag? Amazing job manning. 
It was more like fourth quarter adjustments.
So is Peyton trying to mark this as a "W" in Manning v. Brady?
Give credit where credit is due, Osweiler looks to be in good form. He needs to learn to not hold on to the ball too long. 

Also credit his Oline who got away with holds the whole second half. Also a hold+facemask on the td
not chris harper?
While the rest of America outside Denver credits the refs.
Thats pretty comical, should be thanking the refs
Was Manning responsible for the Harper fumble, Hightower injury, and two bail out calls in the Broncos favor in the final five minutes? Because if not then I don't think it had too much of an impact on the game.
He should credit the refs
And the refs. Might as well downvote myself! I love downvotes!
[deleted]
I don't believe this one iota.  Osweiler was probably told to say this by others...
I'm sure that Manning was hoping that the Broncos would lose so Osweiler looks bad and Manning gets his job back. 
He should also credit the refs for that empty win. 
Should credit the officials for halftime adjustments :p
Man, we REALLY wanted to lose that game didn't we? 
The Lions were uncomfortable winning in Lambeau.
This sub is a minefield for me right now
Not surprised lol. Calvin's fumble at seattle, calvins onside botch, 10 men out on the field... We try hard to lose.

#JustLionsThings 
Can I just complain for a moment about the so-called "round up" on SNF?  I had *no fucking idea* that it came down to a shanked field goal‚ÄîI just assumed that they missed the conversion and that was that.  

The NFL, ESPN, and everyone else needs to get their shit together and indicate what the actual game stories are‚Äîotherwise, why bother?  I can read a fucking box score.  Actually, better:  **Bring back NFL ~~Countdown~~ Primetime!**
We figured that since the Packers lost their 12th man at halftime we'd give them our 11th.
doesn't matter, it wasn't blocked, just shanked, which is actually worse.
The eleventh player was Green Bay's holder.
Goddamn they *REALLY* wanted to lose, didn't they?
The Lions GIFTED the Pack that game. They paid the extra fee to have the store professionally wrap it, and we threw it into a sewage lagoon. 

Dammit, Mathsay. 
We had 9 people on the field for a punt return yesterday. No joke
How does this even happen? Do teams rotate their FG units throughout the game? Was there an injured Lion that normally is out there that would cause them to forget to sub in a replacement? 
Sounds like us.
That was our secret plan to confuse them.  It worked, Crosby was so freaked out he kicked the ball like Charlie Brown.
Lions figured that only keeping 10 men on the field that it'd be one less mistake they'd make that play...


-Cries Uncontrollably-
Never underestimate the effort the Lions will go to to lose a game. 
That's so Lions
For some reason I thought it was a penalty to not have exactly 11 on the field, whether it was 10 or 12.
Lions fans: the 11th man.
I couldn't be happier.  The Lions won, but in the process of doing so, further proved that Jim Caldwell is incompetent and needs to be fired.
Jesus take the wheel
What is this, a picture for ants?
More than a couple of times now I have seen this happen where the kick was missed or blocked with less than 11 guys on the field. Can anyone tell me why?
11th player was God.
Can't even lose properly 
The game has been over for more than a day now, and the Lions are still looking for a way to give it to the Packers.
I see 11
Well, their guardian angel must have been out there too somewhere.
Seems about par for the course. 
We didn't want too many men on the field when we utilized the hand of god
The Ditka Curse!  

FTP
To honor and respect Sean Taylor 
What an embarrassment of a game. How was it even possible for the Packers to lose? I thought I was high the entire time, some kind of weird virtual reality.
**Update: I was the practice squad.
Lol.
Could have had zero on the field and we still would have missed it.

Thanks Masthay!
*sigh*
The Arizona Cardinals blocked a field goal with only 10 men on the field last season.
Find that 11th player and cut him immediately.. clearly he is the problem.
Doesn't matter.  The kick was deflected by the holders hand.  
Based on their effort to lose, im surprised they didnt put at least they didn't put 13 to 17 guys on the field for the kick
Guess we should go and redo it then. To be fair.
IIRC the lions didn't block it, Crosby just fucked up. Or did I not see it right?
Packers season is slowly but surely going downhill.
The Lions gave us every opportunity to win the game, but in the end we out Lions the Lions. Fuck me, what a way to end the streak. 

Only silver lining is that hopefully with the Lions win in Wisconsin, the Red Wings will finally miss the Playoffs this season.
Was one of the reps the same one that ruled on the Tate TD against the Bears a few weeks ago? Maybe Caldwell was confused and counted one of the zebras as a Lion.
Carpe Diem, Lions fans!

Hope this means we can do something similar in Indy!
Fucking lel
Winston was 4 years old when Hasselbeck entered the league...damn
Always liked Hasselbeck. Madden 07 him and Shaun Alexander were my go-to duo.
Gerald Ford was president when Hasselback was born and Bill Clinton was president when Winston was.
Hassel Hype! 
Matt is almost twice the age of Jameis.  If they were dating it would be shameless!
Let's go Matthew!
I wonder if Hassebeck has any shoes older than Winston.  
Hasslebeck giving Winston some of that old man strength. 
The old man triumphs. Winston will be good, but he made some rookie mistakes in the game and couldn't match up with the vet.
Matt Hasselbeck is the GOAT.
You got this Hasselbeck

Andrew Luck this season 2-5 Hasselbeck 4-0, hes da real MVP
Cmon young buck!
...And shows him how the position of QB is meant to be played. Damn, that was impressive by Hasselbeck, Winston... Not so much.
Damn. What happened to Luck? 
Come on, Winston! Take the old man out!
Show him whatfer Jaboo
About to see some Mr. Miyagi throw down
Good luck HasselGOAT!!
if Winston has a Matt hasselbeck like career, would Tampa fans be happy?
I think Hasslebeck is cool and all but we really need the colts to lose this
TIL Drew Brees is only 36.
If Hawks and Colts play against each other it will tear my heart in half :( Hasselbeck is still my favorite player and I'm still rocking his Hawks Jersey and all the Hawks games. :( This will be painful. 
I think the Bucs got this game, just feelin it today
Again, QBs don't play against each other.  It's OK to compare stats but this was not a "faceoff" between QB's.
ITT: Vikings, Bears, and Lions fans having a wonderful time
The Packers are also 0-1 at home against 1-7 teams since November 2015.
Ah so the stupid fact table has turned. Stafford's bullshit stat is now on you.
They are also the first team this year not to win their next game after being beaten by the Panthers in the previous week.
Green Bay hasn't beaten Detroit in Detroit since 2012.
wait, it's shit on the Packers week now?

http://media.giphy.com/media/iPTTjEt19igne/giphy.gif
Trashing Green Bay? This was almost illegal during the offseason.
"Is Aaron Rodgers done?"

- Trent Dilfer
On the road against winning teams:

- Aaron Rodgers: 0-10
- Matthew Stafford: 1-9
Everything is breaking Minnesota's way, which means the Packers are going to blow us out next week.
This is the streak ending packers. KC no wr tds for like 10 years. Gets 1 vs GB. Detriot no Lambeau win since 1991, gets one vs GB. Rodgers no INTS at home since NAM, gets 2 this year. I wish they would throw up a stat saying "Greenbay hasnt won the superbowl with some random stat" so we would win it this year.
It's all Ditka's fault. http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25376163/bears-fans-think-mike-ditka-cursed-the-packers-in-mcdonalds-ad
Things just didn't fall their way for 10 games, I guess.
Vikings loss confirmed.
I mean, don't get me wrong, but I would love to extend this streak. Happy to do it. 
It's alright guys, we have the Vikings right where we want 'em. Right guys? Right???
My body is ready.
Just curious, how do they figure the records of the opponents? Is it at the time they played the game or figured after the season is over with their final records?
While I appreciate the fact the pack is suffering, this Stat is fairly reasonable. Good teams win games at home. Good trams have winning records. So even the best teams will struggle on the road at a good team. 
We're doomed.
I'm not even sure what's wrong with the Packers, other than Lacy being a fat fuck, but I like it.
You know another cool streak?

Detroit hasn't beaten Green Bay on the road since 1991.

Scratch that... SINCE YESTERDAY, BITCHES.
Well I certainly don't like where this is going. I thought /r/NFL was only allowed to post things about how dreamy A-A-Ron is and how brave Mike McCarthy is for giving up play calling responsibilities. Isn't that in the sidebar or something?
As a Lion's fan, its about time these stats about GB start coming out.
That stat won't change this week
Packers got 99 problems but Rodgers is not one.
I understand the packers are sucking right now but holy shit, what is this shit on the packers week?
Very interesting that the wording this time is "Green Bay" instead of "Aaron Rodgers".  I appreciate that though, because it is a team stat.  

Its funny how week-to-week the NFL can be.  GB looked like shit vs the Lions, lost 3 straight, and Packer nation is burning to the ground.  However, if they beat the Vikings next week, not only will they erase this stat but they will be back in first place in the division.
the Ditka commercial curse continues ...
I would like to see this stat for all teams.  What are their records on the road against winning teams since beginning of 2012?
This is yet another way to state "winning teams usually win at home". Here are the road records for all teams facing a team that finished with a winning record from 2012-12-16 through the 2014 season, including playoffs.

|  |  |  |  |
|------|---|---|---|
| Lions | 0-7 | Steelers | 2-3 |
| Falcons | 0-8 | Bills | 2-4 |
| Packers | 0-8 | Buccaneers | 2-5 |
| Jets | 0-8 | Saints | 2-6 |
| Raiders | 0-9 | Cardinals | 2-6 |
| Jaguars | 0-9 | Cowboys | 3-5 |
| Bears | 1-4 | Bengals | 3-5 |
| Vikings | 1-6-1 | Chiefs | 3-7 |
| Panthers | 1-6-1 | Eagles | 4-4 |
| Dolphins | 1-7 | Patriots | 4-5 |
| Redskins | 1-7 | Broncos | 4-5 |
| Browns | 1-9 | Ravens | 4-8 |
| Giants | 1-9 | Colts | 4-9 |
| Texans | 1-9 | 49ers | 5-7 |
| Titans | 1-9 | Chargers | 6-4 |
| Rams | 1-10 | Seahawks | 6-5 |

So yeah, it's not great to be 0-fer in such games, but 66% of the league doesn't have more than 2 such wins during this time. 
These stats are so retarded.  They constantly use the same stat against Detroit/Stafford, well no fucking shit winning teams win at home, that's a big reason they are winning teams in the fucking first place!
Does this mean we're picking the Vikings next week? 
You've doomed us.
What's the record for the rest of the NFL in similar games?
Yes, yes we know. This has been said many times on here before. BTW we hadn't lost to the Lions at home since 1991 until yesterday
We suck right now. Hopefully we turn it around, we're missing Jordy real bad.
But that record at Lambeau, doe.
Man, I love how even legendary franchises with great success aren't safe from all the burns from /NFL fans. Almost makes me not want to kill myself for being a philly fan. My misery welcomes all company.
Are there stats for other teams? Beating a winning opponent on the road can't be easy, I bet even the best teams are at .500 or below.
Fuck the Month of November. 
im sad
[Yes...](http://i.imgur.com/rJye5Cf.gif)
Packer fans finally get a taste of what it's like to be a Vikings fan.  All of those wasted Sundays, the false hope that "this is our year", the heartbreak come playoff time...
The Packers should take note of how the Cardinals drove a stake into the Seahawks when it mattered. As the Packers slide, they're going to rue that blown NFC championship more and more. 
Taken by itself this stat is hard to judge.  How does this stand up to other Superbowl competitors over the same time?
When the Falcons lost to 49'ers I was disgusted and now they had a bye week I see teams like Green Bay get embarrassed by a 1-7 team, Giants let Brady come back when it was 4th and 10 and jags win off a face masking FG... It sobers me a little.
That BAD MAN Aaron Rodgers...

Hahaha... Oh that Stephen A.
Worse still they haven't beat the Lions since 2014
Lions fans on fire in this thread.
Actually the packers beat the 2-1 bears on the road last year week 4....
NFC North hate in here is real.  

Holy shit. 
I hate football right now.
[deleted]
Now, for this stat, did the teams we faced have a winning record going into the game? Or did they end up with a winning record at the end of the season?
Time to rehire Joe Rabbit's Foot Philbin
overrated, over hyped
And in true Arizona sports fashion we'll break this streak in week 15
Shame on the Packers for bring that once great division down!  SHAME!
Go on...

We're the worst team in the NFL right now 
The Bears in 2013 were 8-7 and what were the cowboys record when Flynn led the comeback?
Here's another record they'll break if they keep playing like this.

"First team to go 6-0 and then lose their next 10 games in a row"
Hello, Green Bay, welcome to TCF Bank.
Does this sub forget this fact every week that it gets posted? We were 0-10 last week on the road against winning teams, we just played a home game, so we're gonna be 0-10 this week on the road against winning teams.
[Typed up a too-long response to this post here if anyone is interested.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3t3ytr/how_to_lie_with_statistics_packers_road_record/)
These kind of stats are so stupid to me. So you're telling me that they have a hard time facing good opponents on the road???? My gawd
My take on all this


Green Bay has bad coaching

Rodgers calls a lot of the plays at the line, and thats what made them so great on offense for so long.


But now you have so many players injured, playing banged up, or out for the season that Rodgers....good as he is... can't make up for all the shortcommings of the team by himself. 
Mike McCarthy is a bad coach 
This thread makes me so happy :' )
Y'all have your petty fun and 12 year old Facebook jokes to get karma. Just remember where you were when you woke a sleeping giant. 
News flash: beating good teams on the road is difficult.
Lol it's kind of funny how bitter and cocky the other NFCN fans are, especially the Vikings. We start struggling and it's like Christmas came early for these fucktards. The amount of smug Vikings fans itself is astronomical. It's kind of funny when you realize how just plain pathetic they are. 

I actually think Minnesota Vikings fans are some of the most detestable people you can ever come across.
This thread will be linked to when we advance further into the playoffs than the other NFCN teams
Le discount double check man. 
Isn't this record extended even further as a strictly 'Aaron Rodgers' record? I remember reading he was somewhere around 0-13, but the Pack won a game with Matt Flynn 
Here's hoping for 0-11.

This is the greatest thread in the history of Reddit. 
Oooh this is a good one.
Seahawks imploding? Bad.

Ravens imploding? Really bad.

Green Bay breaking down after a great start? Excellent.

With my two teams in the crapper and Green Bay looking worse I know what I need to do...

GO VIKINGS RAIDERS SUPERBOWL!
This was a thread to be posted last week, not this week.
Beat deez nuts
#repost
The Packers literately shit the bed every year in the regular season (and the post season recently). Let the other NFC North teams celebrate now. Because they won't be in a few weeks. 
How did Ottawa make the Grey Cup? They were an expansion team last year and had 2 wins. What happened?
THE FIELD IS TOO BIG!  
DON'T RUN INTO THE GOALPOSTS!  
THERE'S TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THE FIELD!  
WHERE DID THE EXTRA 50-YARD LINE COME FROM?!  
WHY ARE THEY KICKING ON THIRD DOWN?!  
THE END ZONE IS GIGANTIC!  
WHY DIDN'T HE FAIR CATCH THAT?  
...HOW DID THEY SCORE ONE POINT?!  

^^^GO ^^^ESKIES!
Started last offseason. Go Alouettes! But I thinks it's cool how every team in the league has been to the grey cup in the last 5 (?) Seasons. That's a competitive league.
You should move the game to Monday night. I'd watch the shit out of that over Schaub vs McCown.

No chance I watch a second when Steelers-Seahawks and Patriots-Broncos(in the fucking snow!) are on.
hey op it'd be pretty neat if you could give a rough summary of the season and the teams in it, for those of us who don't follow cfl. 
One question: wtf's a Redblack?
It's been going on for 103 years....
Loved it last year, Learn their strange rules.  Watch them run towards the line of scrimmage before the play starts.
My girlfriend took me to an Eskimos/Stampeders game in September, and it was so much freaking fun. When I got home I kept watching the Eskimos (or 'skimos, as I call them) using the magic of ESPN3 online. I've been looking forward to the 103rd Grey Cup all week.  

Incidentally, the last time I watched the Grey Cup was in 2003 when I was in college in upstate NY and got the CBC on campus tv. The Eskimos won.
I'll be there!
Fuck yeah, grey cup. #GREYLIVESMATTER
Fall Out Boy is going to be playing the halftime show, in case you needed another reason to watch.
Will the cast of Corner Gas be there for halftime entertainment?
I'd love to watch but Broncos game is on near the end. I'll follow it though! 
Why not, eh?
What network will it be on? 
6:00pm is pretty convenient, will lead right into SNF. Nice.
Sunday at 6? But I'm watching football then...
Is this airing live in the US? If so,  what channel? 
Why not. If I can find a good stream, I'm down.
I'm from Edmonton and this will be perfect for me.I really hope the Eskimos can win so at least one of the teams is doing well 
Is there a list of what channels will carry the game by region and cable provider?
I'm glad this was posted. I've been wanting to watch their championship for awhile but never paid attention to when it was. I watched some game a few years ago that really peaked my interest. It had pretty much everything. Offensive and defensive touchdowns, a safety, a kick or punt return and then a point from kicking it to the 1 yard line. 
Last year I watched it, and it was fun as hell. I watched the Stampeders a couple times this year, still fun to watch.

As a Flames fan, fuck Edmonton. Go REDBLACKS.
Also, for Redskins fan, you can cheer for the Eskimos, they have the same problem, Inuit are asking them to change the name.
Watching highlights from the Redblacks first game of this year [here](http://www.ottawaredblacks.com/video/index/id/111701). 

Is it just me or does the skill level between the players seems to have a noticeable gap? Also, are this many interceptions in a game normal in the CFL? Overall, very entertaining to watch.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPOS786qBsI
Honestly if you guys have fewer commercials then the NFL I'll watch. 
Goooooo Eskies #Winnipegger XD
Whoo go REDBLACKS
"CFL vs NFL: longer, wider, faster"

Oh, Canada!
This shit was so live last year. I will be there!
Do I need to RSVP?
If watch some, while waiting for the 7:30 game to start. Where could I watch?
Aaaaaaargoooooos :(
Anybody know who Chris Berman picked to win?
I remember the CFL expansion into the US when the Baltimore Stallions ended up winning the Grey Cup. It's too bad it didn't work out.
If I'm in Detroit who is my team supposed to be? Windsor doesn't have a team do they?
I've got a discord server up for the game if anyone is bored and wants to chat: https://discord.gg/0fmtcR8qtkHsRTgf
http://cfltesthd8.moonfruit.com/

This game is turning into something...
Wow that's so polite of you. Who would have ever expected that?
I'm Canadian and had no idea the grey cup was this soon. I guess I'm a typical torontonian. 
I actually might check it out for a bit if the afternoon games are turning out to be horrible.  However, Denver/New England at Denver in the snow with Denver's seemingly competent back up QB starting on the night before my IRL cakeday.  I will probably not see the finish if the timing is anything like an NFL game where the last quarter takes over an hour.
No thanks. I'm Canadian, and can't bare to watch the second rate football that's put on by all 9 teams.
Watched the Eskies once... Eesh
You guys should watch the seahawks steelers game which will be so much better
Why can't Canadians just play real football?
As a NFL watching Canadian, I can safely say that the CFL is a joke. 
I hate the CFL, even though I am from Toronto I just want an NFL team!
[Aww ya](http://gfycat.com/IdioticColdAmericanshorthair)
Hope he aint driving 
That's great news. I hope the symptoms don't start hitting him later tonight / early tomorrow. When I was concussed from a football hit, I didn't really feel any ill effects until about 12 hours later. 
Please let this be true! We love you Teddy!
I need sources to tell me what Teddy is having for dinner please
Very good news, that was a really scary hit from Joyner.
Good, I hope he's okay and recovers fully. 
After all the draft talk, who would have guessed Teddy would show this much toughness? Stiff arming linemen, busting 25-yard runs after twisting his ankle, popping back up after each hit.
please be true. Between Parise and Teddy this week and Flip and Kill last week this has been a horseshit couple of weeks in our fair state 
"Teddy, why are we sitting at a table in Home Depot?"
That's really good to hear! I imagine he still has to pass protocols etc. but from a personal health view it's great that he seems fit enough to do that right?  
Guess we're getting Bridgwater vs Carr next week. üòÄ
Good to hear.
I'd feel fine too if I took a nice long nap in the middle of the afternoon
Hope he's good fir next week. I've been looking forward to Carr-Teddy for a long time.
That's good to hear.  Hope he is back to 100% and back on the field next week. I'll feel better that we lost this game and he gets to come back after this week.

*Adrian Peterson is a great father and role model*
that's my mother fucking quarterback!
No Teddy just retire, think of your wife and kids.

Wait wrong guy
Teddy legit seems like one of the nicest guys in football. All the best Skoldier!
Glad he is doing well!
I'm glad he's alright
NFL Total Access is saying he suffered a concussion. Did he?
This man got me to see tits I'd never have seen without him.

#TitsForTeddy 
hes gonna do something nuts like use a spoon to drink his water. we will hear about concussions for a month. 
Thank goodness he's OK. 
He's probably salivating at playing our defense with the way Big Ben ripped us apart.  Glad to see he appears okay.
Would love to be that waiter. Teddy will try to tip him again every few minutes.
"Teddy was the toughest quarterback we ever played"

The video and story about the hit are really worth watching for all Teddy Bridgewater fans.
Great news. 

Fucking hate injuries.
Doesn't matter, he was knocked out cold, that means concussion.

Hopefully he will be ok, but he is getting monitoring for a while.
[Picture of Teddy Bridgewater at dinner last night](http://i.imgur.com/wrbdGJK.jpg)
This makes me happy.
Love Teddy and hate the fake rivalry.  

Plunder Bros don't cherry pick stats against Plunder Bros.  Not when we got plundering to do.  

Let's tear some fucking shit up next week.  Leave the stats for the basement dorks. 




I think it's allowed for me to root for the Vikings to dethrone the Packers.

...Right?
Since when did concussion protocol care how the player says he feels?

I hope the training staff still OKd him
I honestly wouldn't mind them sitting him next week as a precaution.  We play an AFC opponent on the road so it isn't as detrimental for our playoff run if we lose.  Also Barr and Newman are injured so they could heal up too.  Although Teddy vs Carr would be fun to see
Hope to see him back and playing next week, too many injuries to great players this season to the point that it feels like things are becoming a bit undercompetitive.
I know that it seems like good news but the symptoms of a concussion don't normally show up that day. You might have a headache or some slight nausea the day off but they go away and then the real, much worse symptoms come later. That being said I hope he is concussion free because concussions are awful to deal with, and I wouldn't wish them on anyone.
Him eating dinner doesn't mean anything as far as concussions go...
I always feel good after a nice nap
That was filthy and should be met with a suspension. You can't blast qbs to the head at the end of a slide. Fuck that. Fine his ass and suspend him
Sometimes, the League and coaches have to protect players from themselves. Teddy was freaking out-cold on the turf yesterday.
Still think he's gonna be out for a week.
Good. What a classy guy. 
Well duh, I'd feel great after a midday nap that long too.
"Also concussions are a myth"
Probably helps that he took a little nap in the middle of the game.  (In all seriousness the hit was uncalled for).
What is Teddy eating for dinner? 
Glad to hear he's doing alright, but he really shouldn't be going out.  With concussive brain trauma, research shows that the best way to ensure fast, proper healing is to experience as few stimuli as possible. 
Scrambled eggs will probably be his entr√©e 
Good to hear.  You hate to see a cheap shot like that, and Teddy being such a level-headed kid makes me happier that he's ok.
He's at dinner right now thinking its still halftime.
I hope he plays next week
At first I thought the Rams won and this was a fucked up joke. Good to hear he's ok. 
That doesn't mean anything when it comes to concussions
"Thats exactly what a concussed person would say."
It's all fun and games until they find Teddy face first in the mashed potatoes.
Oh okay...phew, glad he's okay ;)
I hope he remembers how to get home.

I should not have said that. 
Glad to see he's okay.

*The Eagles are for more talented than the Cowboys and didn't win by a lucky coin toss and numerous injuries*
He feels great! He can't wait for the coach to take them all to McDonald's for dinner but he has to be home by 7 because he has to study for his spelling test Monday morning.
He still shouldn't be playing next week.  He was OUT and I really wouldn't want to push things with possibly more blows to the head that soon.
Fried walleye y'all!

You know you are doing something right when you make it to the Greg Williams bounty list (unlike his parents, I won't spell the name Greg incorrectly). Teddy should view this as a sign of respect in the only way that scumbag can express it.
"Yeahhh, Dave and Busters! Good win, guys!""Teddy it's the third quarter, sit down and look at the flashlight""Do they even have D&amp;B's in LA??"
If anyone had any doubts about Romo coming back now... that pretty much answers your question.
The end of an era
If this dude somehow made it in baseball after a failed baseball and football career, it would make for an amazing 30 for 30. 
If you love something, let it go.
Maybe my Rams are desperate enough to make a waiver claim
Its been hilarious watching the cowboys go through the same process the browns went through, just hyper accelerated over a few weeks. 

maybe he will be good! Maybe he can win a few games. Maybe he will win one... Ok cut him. 
Rip the best pure passer of a backup Romo has ever seen.
he made $660k this year for half a season and played 3 games. not bad. 

I bet you someone will sign him. He made $7.5 million with Cleveland. Not bad.
Weeden need you anyway
Check out @tonyromo's Tweet: https://twitter.com/tonyromo/status/666649048212860928?s=09
I hear the Browns might need a QB.....
The Cowboys are listening to Skip Bayless &amp; staying off the WEEEEEEEDEN
So Weeden is pretty much done right? Don't really see another team picking him up.

RIP WeeDenBoys
Goodnight my sweet prince
Thanks again Holmgren 
They tried to reach Weeden for a comment, but he checked down to the RB
Weeden does have a nice arm. But I don't think he's a football player mentally. He doesn't see the game well. Cassel, who's not the greatest QB, ran the Offense much better and he didn't even have enough time to really learn it.
*There goes my hero...*
Both of our first round picks from 2012 are now free agents.

Fuck you Holmgren!
I really wish I'd saved some of those comments where Browns fans were being prophets of doom and Cowboys fans were arguing that he really wasn't that bad, it was just that Cleveland sucked, etc.

On a serious note, this must mean Romo is ready to go. Time to see if the Cowboys can still scrape out a division title. 
Cool, can we let Hardy go next?
Soapbox time:

I said it from day one.  If a team as desperate for a QB as the Browns have been for 17+ years thinks the guy is shit, he might be shit.  Weeden sucks and good riddance.
Such a frustrating season where we could be a one or two loss team if Romo never got hurt
And now both of Tom Heckert's first round draft picks are out of the NFL permanently. He should be banned from making any football decisions at any level for the rest of his life. 
He really wasn't that bad
That just may be Weeden's career.
I love making fun of Brandon Weeden as much as the next guy, but was he worse than Cassel? 
He wasnt absolutely terrible, but if Romo is coming back, it doesnt make sense to keep him AND Cassel on the roster.

*If Matt Cassel had a tenth of the abillity that Tyrod Taylor possesses, he would have been traded for a 1st instead*
Is Cassell actually that much better than this guy? 
Let the nfl bidding war begin. 
He should come to Houston, we are a reserve for QBs who can't succeed elsewhere.
I really wanted this guy to succeed. Certainly wasn't mad at him for his time in Cleveland.
I think he would be a pretty good baseball coach... he should go do that instead
Real talk since Savage is on IR I could see us scooping him. Also fuck Rick Smith
weeden was better than who they had in center last week.  But i hate the cowboys good.  Maybe they can bring back tebow to help heal all their criminals from sin
can we sign him and put him above Vick please.......
Please pace get him as a back up. Pickles is the worst. 
Not very surprising considering he was originally considered a backup to Romo but failed to deliver the moment he was called upon. It was pretty obvious that when the Cowboys brought in Cassel, there was no return for Weeden when Romo was back on the roster. Almost no teams can afford to keep 3 QBs on their roster, especially one which has failed to perform his role.
Can't wait for the extended version of this:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8SsCqpa-Lk
I wonder if the Texans pick him up since Hoyer is now hurt.
Probably wouldn't be a bad fit for us.
Surprised he lasted as long as he did
Well, at least that's one positive thing to come out of this season
"Weeden went 0-3 after Romo went down....He was later replaced by Matt Cassel, who lost all four of his starts." 
RIP Mr. Potatohead
WELCOME BACK, TONY ROMEO &lt;3

Brandon "We done" with you.
Good riddance.
...the guy with the best completion percentage in the league (over 50 passes).
I hope Kitna is in shape.
Tebow to Dallas confirmed?
HOLLA...HOLLA HOLLA.... WEEDEN BOYZ!
Brandon, Wee Done.

Sincerely,

Jerry
Well fuck and to think many people thought of him of being an NFL QB back when he was at Oklahoma State.
Such a gifted releaser
however, greg hardy is still sitting happy
Somewhat serious question... Judging from his play at Cleveland, why would any team pick him up? Like, I guess I don't understand why a team would think, well he was bad at Cleveland, but HERE, HERE he'll be good. Maybe it happens a lot and I'm just blind in my disdain for Weeds but still man. It seems like a no-brainer for the Cowboys to not pick him up... ever.
They should have had a 12 year old kid tell Weeden he was released.
Dream over...LOL
Hold up. Hold up. WeeDen Boyz
This will fix their problems. Fucker was terrible last week. 
Weeden out the bad ones. 
Hey we're getting our franchise QB back so .. bye and thanks for trying

Love, 
The Cowboys
Oohhhh yeeeaaahhh! See ya! 
The curse has been lifted 
Bye bye captain check down!
Weeden to Browns confirmed 
[So long! Don't let the door hit you on the way out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVrEwCa8nSA)
[deleted]
2 down, 2 to go.

I could see Weeden going to the NBA and end up as a terrible bakup PG like Steve Blake.

Then , he can go to the NHL and suck again.
Will the Cowboys ever see a ball thrown so beautifully again?
He should have tried being a better team leader by assaulting a coach and showing up late.
Completed 72% of his passes this year.

If you've got good short/intermediate receivers he could be worth a flyer as a backup.

I personally wouldn't do it, but he's not the *worst* option out there. He's just not good either.
THERE IS A GOD
but why would Jerry get rid of the most gifted passer?
It was really stupid of them to quickly try to get Matt Cassel, quickly teach him the offense, and quickly replace Weeden. I bet Weeden would have won one or two games. But they have Cassel now which is an upgrade so no need for Weeden anymore.
what? NOOOOOOO
era an of end 
No one made our defense better than Weeden. He will truly be missed.
I am ok with this
So long to Brandon Weeden, Cowboys Legend
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA I DONT KNOW WHAT TO FEEL. EXCEPT HAPPINESS. 
Reading every Cowboy fan in the thread defending  Jerry Jones... I will just leave this here

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome
I wonder which prisoner Jerry Jones has his eye on to fill the void? 
lol holmgren
NOOOOO we need to see Carr vs Bridgewater
NO THE VIKINGS ARE OUR ONLY HOPE 
Fuck Greg Williams.


"On April 5, documentary filmmaker Sean Pamphilon released audio of a meeting Williams held with his defense before their 2012 divisional playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers. In a profanity-laced speech, Williams instructed his defense to target several 49ers players. He ordered his men to try to knock out running back Kendall Hunter, even if it meant hitting him out of bounds. He specifically directed them to try to tear wide receiver Michael Crabtree's ACL, and to go after wide receiver Kyle Williams specifically **because he had a history of concussions.**"
Fuck Gregg Williams. 
Yeah, hope Joyner's suspended for that.  Come on, can't have that.  
that hit was dirty af
He was, or at least looked, unconscious. Scary, scary stuff. 
I don't mean to pull out the pitchforks, but that's suspension worthy, right? A very unnecessarily aggressive hit 
Good thing Greg Williams got another job, you think he won't trade a 15 yard penalty for the opposing qb every drive? What a fucking joke 
Rodney Harrison called Jeff Fisher out on NBC. Gregg Williams could get a guy killed.
Gregg Williams is the biggest POS coordinator there is.
I see a lot of "Fuck Greg Williams" but fuck Jeff Fisher too. Does anyone remember how dirty the Titans were too? This asshole employed and encouraged Cortland Finnegan too. He hired Greg Williams. Fuck Jeff Fisher. His teams have always been dirty. 
That has to be suspension worthy, at the very least a fine of some sort
What a dirty hit on a sliding QB. Zimmer is furious
I really hope Teddy Bridgewater will be okay. Very talented dude 
I don't even hate the Saints anymore. I really just hate this piece of shit Gregg Williams.
Fucking Rams always taking out QBs 
What a fucking dickhead. 
Yea I think it's safe to say he has a concussion if he got knocked out
What a fucking nasty hit, I hope Bridgewater comes out fine but that looked brutal as hell.
Rodney Harrison just put Fisher on blast.  Quick cut to commercial. 
Forget deflated footballs.  *This* is the kind of thing the NFL should be investigating and punishing harshly.

I think it's long past time to ban Gregg Williams from the NFL.
If you did this bullshit in the NHL you would lose a lot of money, a lot of games, and be on notice for the rest of your career. The NFL blabbering on about player safety is just so much fucking noise
http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/11/08/minnesota-vikings-teddy-bridgewater-injury-rodney-harrison-comments


Hey everyone! I got the Rodney Harrison comments here
Gregg Williams is a sack of shit and he shouldn't be allowed to coach in the NFL
Is the evaluation really necessary? Seems pretty obvious after that hit
So fucking dirty, what was he thinking?
The rams take out another QB
[Zimmer ghosting Fisher](https://streamable.com/c8px)
The dude seemed to be celebrating the hit too.  What a scumbag.
I mean I hate the Vikings, but that hit pissed me off, fucking dirt
A dirty hit like this pretty much ended Trent Green's career. 
Guessing Bridgewater will miss at least 2 weeks after that.
Wow that is always scary shit, hope he is ok
Fuck Greg Williams.
Parise Thursday, now Teddy today? It hurts to live 
Hope it doesn't have any lasting effect, dirty hit and I'm sure Gregg Williams was very proud.
Stay Strong Teddy B The Based God
Im not looking forward to playing the rams.  
The Rams defense claims another
I wish football was more like hockey and Joyner got the shit beat out of him after that.  That would have been fun to watch.
Saw the play. That has to be a suspension. 
Fucking Gregg Williams, such a piece of shit. 
This is why i hate playing the rams, they can kill your QB more than any other team
Video?
Anyone know what the average recovery time is for concussions? Are we looking at Teddy missing a few games?
Rams killing everyone
Gregg Williams and Lamarcus Joyner can go fuck themselves so hard.
Watching Teddy get hit on a play where he clearly gave up almost made me tear up.  It's the closest I've ever been to crying when watching football.

&amp;nbsp;

I did see an interesting quote from Joyner that if it's sincere makes me feel a lot better.  

&amp;nbsp;

Quote from Joyner;

&amp;nbsp;

"Joyner was apologetic after the game.

"I know that guy. I grew up across the railroad tracks from him. My mom knows his mom. My dad knows his mom. I would never intentionally do a dirty play like that on Teddy Bridgewater. It was a bam-bam play. He's a taller-in-stature guy compared to me. I did not know he was (planning) to slide when I launched. He slid and we connected. If I could take it back, personally, I would take it back because I'm not a dirty player," Joyner said."

&amp;nbsp;

If anyone is interested here's the source;
http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000575615/article/mike-zimmer-fumes-about-perceived-cheap-shot
Bet /r/NFL will agree the Rams are dirty now, even after they tried to hurt Beckham Jr. the Rams were cool, scary underdogs
They just showed the replay on the SNF pregame....what the fuck St Louis.
Fuck gregg williams, fuck joyner. 
One of the dirtiest plays I've ever seen.  Joyner, and Gregg Williams, can get fucked.  Hope Teddy is okay. 
Dirty ass fucking Rams.

How is Gregg Williams still allowed in the NFL?
Greg Williams and Joyner can choke on my balls. 
UPDATE: WILL NOT RETURN
That hit was totally fucked. No excuse. 
Coach Zimmer was rather restrained in that press conference
Dirty hit, no doubt about it. I see Gregg Williams has not changed one bit. Fuck that guy. Hopefully Teddy is alright.
this is gonna be a fun thread
This piece of shit should be suspended 
Right when the Packers look vulnerable to lose the division, this happens. God damn you injury gods.
why is the one guy behind bounty gate allowed back in the nfl? 
No need for that tackle. 
The Rams doing what they do best.  Dirtiest squad in the league by a country mile.
What a dirty fucking hit. And people say Jeff Fisher teams aren't dirty AF, hard to justify that with the hiring of Gregg Williams. 
I got emotional explaining what happened to Teddy to my wife. That's my quarterback!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwEihRd7fKA
Dirty, absolutely disgusting hit. I don't care if he plays for the Vikings it sucks seeing a player down like that. Hope he makes a full recovery. 
If we downvote this post, that means it never happened right?
Dirty fucking plays. Fuck Joyner and fuck Williams.
Anyone willing to believe Gregg Williams is a fucker NOW? We know that feel, Vikings, just be glad they don't get two shots at your QB each year.
I want the record to reflect that I commented on this post.  FUCK GREG WILLIAMS
That's fucked up
Fine+Suspension or just a Fine? 
Wow what the actual fuck. I got so excited that the Vikings were having good luck with injuries, but this isn't even an injury sustained from play. It's a fucking intentional, illegal knockout blow to OUR STARTING QB OF ALL FUCKING PEOPLE????

NFL what the fuck your league is a shitshow this season. 
What is with the majority of Rams fans defending this asshole?
after watching lockette last week and teddy throwsevelt this week, i hope we dont see scary hits like this for a while. and i hope both heal up quick and can return to play at full strength. 
He got knocked the fuck out... Goddamn fuck Williams.
Everyone is saying Fuck Gregg Williams but for me this is all fuck Roger Goodell for permitting him to play. I have so much hate for Goodell that this guy can actually coach the game. Goodell needs to instantiate rules that if broken lead to your eternal ban. No off the cuff penalties. He needs to build a rule book with static punishments if you violate them. No more time spent punishing players for wearing too dark a shade of cleat. Anything this guy says about caring about player safety is unbelievably ridiculous.
There should be a static number of concussions allowed and insurance policies that are paid out to players that breach the number.
There is an infinite amount of opportunity to protect players and not by making the game less physical but by instantiating static rules with static punishments. Done and done.
Joyner needs to be suspended, no questions asked.

This needs to re-ignite investigation into the Rams' entire coaching situation. Don't tell me that slimy fucker Williams isn't handing out bounties **again** and don't tell me that the staff aren't *at least* generally aware of what's going on. Upon review of the plays around that time, it certainly *looks* like they went for Teddy's knees in the play prior to the one that resulted in the concussion. If Goodell can go to war with 'repeat offenders' Brady and Belichick, he can (and should) go nuclear on the Rams. 

Get this shit out of the game, and find these scumbags something else to do with their time since they can't conduct themselves professionally.
The Rams have been the dirtiest team in the league 

No surprise here 
The Rams have been the dirtiest, scummiest, shittiest team since Fisher and Williams have been there and no one wants to talk about it.
Fischers quote on how other quarterbacks have been hit before kinda makes me think that the culture there is pretty shit. Instead of taking responsibility, he just kind of brushes it to the side like it's the norm


I think the Rams fan base is great, btw, just really don't think Williams should be in the NFL
Rams are dirty as fuck and have been for the past few years.
I hope he's OK because dude was OUT COLD on the field man that was rough
I wish this was hockey for a day because Joyner woulda gotten thrashed, and Zimmer might have went full Tortorella on Williams 
The sooner we get rid of Greg Williams the better. He's a dodgy bastard and I don't trust him
It's a Rams team. What do you expect? 
Do you all realize it's Gregg williams and always has been? Not the franchise he works for.
Serious question, it looks like that Rams guy couldn't slow his momentum once he saw Teddy sliding so he tried to get out of the way. Why is everyone saying he had plenty of time to dodge or slow down and that makes it a dirty hit?

Once again serious question, I understand everyone is angry I'm not trying to argue for or against anyone
Well we pulled out the win despite the offense going completely stagnant after he left the game. This is going to hurt us real bad moving forward.
Emperor Palpatine has nothing on the hate flowing in this thread. /nerdlife
Ok being totally serious and curious right now, why does everyone hate Greg Williams so much? What specifically has he done?
[deleted]
Any update regarding his status? Praying it's not major!
I don't blame the Rams, I blame Gregg Williams 100%. Rams are cool in my book. GG guys. 
I loved how the Vikes didn't stoop to their level and try to take out Gurley or some shit, they played a fair game and the Rams didn't and the Vikes still won. Foles got a little beat up but they were all clean hits from a seriously pissed off and motivated defense. This win felt like some great karmic justice, it's hard to enjoy it though because I'm worried about Teddy.
Wuck Freg Gilliams
What would happen if someone started a crowdfund for a 'pot' to provide a bonus + legal fees for whoever on the planet manages to physically injure Gregg Williams.  

Before you comment on how fucked up that would be, GREGG WILLIAMS ACTUALLY DID THIS HIMSELF ON MANY OCCASIONS AND IS VERY WEALTHY FOR IT.
Evaluated for a concussion? Evaluated?

I'm not a doctor, but I don't think  you can be knocked unconscious and *not* get a concussion.
Zimmer is so classy. We play clean, and we will continue to do so.
I don't think the hit was dirty.  The defender has to stop the ball carrier.  He is going for the tackle, then in an instant he has to react to the slide, continue to make the tackle, and avoid getting cleated by the foot coming towards him.  It looks bad in super slo-mo but I don't think in real time he tried to hurt Teddy.  
I know for a fact I will be downvoted, but I don't think that was Joyner's intention. He let up and looked to be trying to avoid hitting Bridgewater, who slid and of course leaned backwards. The defender should have been more careful but it looked like an accident 
[deleted]
Greg Williams *needs* cancer. 
Joyner should get fined a ton of money and get a multiple game suspension.

You can't get away with shit like that, especially with KO'ing a QB.
After looking at the game thread, I thought the hit would be a lot more egregious. It didn't look overtly malicious. It deserved a penalty, but I don't think he will get suspended.

Not exactly [this](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/915731/DIRTY-HIT-HARRISON.gif) or [this](http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/nwitimes.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/61/8618f779-1576-5344-9dae-ace2133641b5/4e5990f825893.preview-620.jpg)
I don't get the problem here, he clearly goes left and avoids Teddy. He does still get hit but he tried to move. 
#WELP.

As a Cardinals flaired fan, /r/baseball already despises me on sight. I guess it's only fair that my Rams flair become a scarlet letter in /r/NFL as well. 

Hey Patriots, fans. Ask Belichek  if the Evil League Of Evil has an opening?
ITT:  A lot of people who watched this in slow motion replay who think that defenders have Nintendo abilities to reverse momentum in mid jump.   
Didn't see the hit, from the outrage on reddit I expected to see worse. You have two athletes closing on each other near 35 mph and you think one of them 'aimed' at the others head? lol.
Just let me know when it's okay to come back to /r/nfl... I'll go back to lurking 
I don't think it was dirty just unfortunate...those kind of hits happen all the time...deserves a flag, but I think the fact that he was knocked out made everyone more upset than they would be if he had gotten right back up.
Definitely looked like a concussion. Big hit, looked like he was asleep. 

I think the hit was illegal but not dirty. Bridgewater slid so late he didn't give much time for Joyner to let up 

http://i.imgur.com/VjuIg6n.png Clearly Joyner is beginning to dive when Bridgewater starts his slide. 
I hope Bridgewater's okay, and I don't mean to poke the bear but I don't think that was dirty. Joyner was going for the hit well before he started his slide, at least from what I saw.
Huh, I kinda like him
Sliding needs to be made illegal.

Easiest way to prevent injuries like this.

Flagging, fining players is obviously not working.
Jesus Christ people, yes the hit was dirty, but 98% of the game was hard fought and pretty clean.  We have tons of stand up guys and clean players on the team and one guy makes one dirty hit and the whole team is dirty.  This subreddit crucifies the NFL for being reactionary, practice what you preach guys.   Stay classy.
Everyone in this thread is blaming Williams. Y'all need some help. 
One of our players makes an admittedly dirty play and now our entire team and fan base are the scum of /r/NFL ... seems about right with the common intelligence of your average user on Reddit
Would love to have the difference between that and the Vikings player who drove his forearm into the neck of Nick Foles 3 steps after he released the ball, if the answer is simply "fuck Greg Williams" then fair enough.
[deleted]
I knew it! Collinsworth bought ProFootballFocus then he made the Premium Stats private and not available to the public anymore so that he could personally use them in his tweets. 
40 catchable balls, 45 catches, 0 drops.

Edit: /s
Now here's a guy who...
Amendola is severely underrated, he's about to have a big second half.
[He](https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/dolacatch.gif)  ... [definitely](http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view3/1205908/danny-amendola-one-handed-o.gif) ... [does](http://cdn1.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1161917/dannyomg_medium_medium.gif)
I wonder if he'll take on a bigger role now that Edelman is hurt or if LaFell will take that place.
Yeah.....we know.

Legitimately lost sleep Sunday night.
I call bullshit. 

Receivers are mandated to drop at least 33.33(repeating of course)% of catchable passes in 2015...
STOP JINXING US COLLINSWORTH!
I miss him dearly.
I miss you sweet prince.
Makes me so happy to see a Texas Tech Alum having success. I don't know what's up with us pumping out short white receivers. 
I am waiting for Larry Fitzgerald to tweet out an apology for any drops he has had this year. Dude still has stellar hands (I know he has had 2 seasons in his career where he only dropped 1 pass in each of those respective seasons. In-fucking-sane.)
Baby come back!
Great, now he'll drop one
ITT: amazing catches by Amendola

Holy shit, dude is impressive 
FWIW: Doug Baldwin has caught 96 consecutive passes ([article from 3 weeks ago](http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/baldwin-streak-84-catches-0-drops-tops-in-nfl/)) without a drop and Amendola only has 2 more catches than him this year.
and he just had to be a freakin Patriot!

I swear after so many years of Pats receivers booting passes, it's no wonder they look more horrifying than usual this year. Especially with a healthy Gronk. This could be the year of the perfect season, at this rate. What a fucking squad.
I don't care what the stats say. Larry Fitzgerald still has the best hands in the business.

Amendola doesn't put up big stats but he is a huge part of the offense.  If it is crunch time and we need a big play or a big catch, it's Danny, every time.  Dude is crazy clutch for the pats.
Alright Patriots you had your fun with him now give him back.
Let's hope he can keep it up with the inevitable increase in workload.  
Amendola's hands are definitely his strong suit. He's made some flat-out spectacular catches over the years. In quickness and elusiveness, Edelman has him beat, but Danny Amendola is a major asset to the team.
Yo Chip, trade for this man 
Yeah Miss him a bunch. To bad everytime he got going he got hurt :(
I miss Amendola...  He always caught the ball, even if it killed him, at least he has a good QB throwing him the ball now so he doesn't need to put himself in as dangerous of situations.
So...start him this week?
Danny AmendGOATla
Dude's amazing. I was one of the doubters who was really salty about losing Welker. He has been amazing and is now one of our best receivers!
I want to punch Collinsworth in his stupid Adam's Apple. 
So all is not lost?
i wish they would say passes instead of balls in situations like ths
&gt; wish the rams still had him

can you imagine case keenum zac stacy and amendola on same team?
He went to my high school! Watched
Him in the Texas state championship he was a monster. Good luck Dola! 
Wasn't his nickname " Danny Hands" or am I just making this up?

Literally the only player Bradford has played with on either team that doesn't drop his passes.
Looks great until he goes down with injury as almost every year (and if he hasn't in recent years, its because he's been invisible on the offense).  

Edelman is quite clearly the superior player.  Edelman can move after the catch, get open better, has returned kicks better for a longer period of time, and has better hands when he isn't recovering from a finger injury.  

These stats with Amendola won't last - the drops will come, assuming he's able to get open and get targets.  
hopefully collinsworth has some time to teach simple mort how to use twitter #prayformort
Doug Baldwin deserves love as well. I don't have the statistics in front of me right now, but he has been absolutely balling out (when the ball is within his vicinity).
Wreck em!
He's quietly had a very good year. If our #3 can step up we may be able to keep on trucking along.
He also caught a bunch that you'd call uncatchable for most. Like that ridiculous jump ball a couple of weeks ago.
He's so primed to have the big Welker drop in the SB allowing the Giants to win another championship and Eli to become 3-li. 
I love how Patriots fans act like they love Amendola now. I remember a ton of hatred for him and his drops in the past.
Rams/Pats fans: What is Amendola like? I've seen what he can do on the field when he's 100 percent, but I've never heard anything about his personality/life.
Amendola's career: 4 drops, 17 injuries. 
    so much hate
[deleted]
I'm amazed he didn't say Tom Brady.
The responses have it all backwards. They're not trying to catch Hasselbeck because he's 40 and 4-0, they're testing him because he's going to be clean and that way they can show they randomly drug test athletes. This is how they can avoid the mid-2000s baseball scandal.
The guy was bald at 23, the man has so much testosterone in him that his own hair couldnt keep up with him. 
Hey it's like high school all over again, better test that backup place kicker. You never know. 
[Hasselbeck right now](http://i.imgur.com/kzKFAxD.jpg)
[For those wondering this is a trug](http://i.imgur.com/8TK1kCZ.jpg). Hasselbeck seems like the type to be using them. 
Reminds me of when Pat McAfee got "randomly" tested after decking Trindon Holliday on a return.

Edit: Autocorrect didn't like Trindon's last name :P
This is Russell Wilson's HGH.
Funny how they keep "randomly selecting" guys who everyone knows are clean.  Nice way of avoiding any more drug scandals right now. 
The man just can't lay off those trugs.
Well we can all agree that no Titan is using PEDs. If they are they need their money back.

^^:(
I would love if he visited my kids school during "Drug-Free" week.
They do know he led a team to the Super Bowl once upon a time. Most back-up QBs arent 3x pro bowlers and NFC champions. lol he is 40 tho
Again, random drug testing isn't "out of a hat" selections, its that any player can be chosen at any time to be tested.  Hassleback is either a control, or they think it's likely that he's using since he's like Father Time and dropping dimes.
Roger Goodell sure does love Hasselbeck's clean piss, he can't get enough of it!  
Trugs are bad, mmkay? 
Trugs. Just say Bo. 
If the tests were truly random, then weird "coincidences" would happen naturally anyway.  Human beings have a habit of finding patterns where they don't actually exist.
I want to hear what Irsay is still on
Lol at the pic of Latimer from The Program.
Doing trugs, throwing tuddy's
When he knows he's ready to retire, he should wait around until his final drug test and just shoot up dope or something to make himself the greatest heroin using athlete of all time.
trugs are bad m'kay 
Who wouldn't check him for trugs?
[This man should be conducting all "random" drug testing](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/theoffice/images/9/98/Drugtesting.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20060703010907)
They dont choose people at random, they test everybody and do it at random times and dates.
"Random"
Oh good, for a second I thought he was getting a drug test
I really, really hate these types of posts. Drug testing in the NFL has never been "random", nor has the NFL ever claimed that they were supposed to be random. During the season the NFL can test whoever it wants, whenever it wants. It's only requirements are CBA restrictions on the number of times a player can be tested. And for players who have violated the substance policy, those restrictions are basically nil.

So, no, Hasselbeck's testing probably *wasn't* random, but then again, nobody ever claimed it was.

Players and fans who think the tests are random have a poor understanding of the CBA.
What's a trug test 
I hope this guy gets in front of a camera with a massive joint as soon as he retires. 
Gotta watch out for that trug use. It can really mess up your life. Say no to drugs kids
Just say "No" to trugs. 
Why would they have him do a tug test.. They need to rest that arm... Noodle arm from to much tugs is painful
trug life
well he must be a trug addict.
I didn't know Fosamax is a performance enhancing drug. Bet Romo would've made it through the season if he took some.
OIL CHANGES FOR EVERYONE
Okay, so he tweets about it every time he's tested. Why does /r/nfl care so much?
Nothing worse than a random trug test. 
There is a common misconception that "random" means everyone has an equal chance of being tested. That is not true. It means that there is an element of random chance. Like if you buy multiple tickets for a lottery, then there is not an equal chance of each participant winning but it's still random. If the NFL sees one player doing significantly better than expected it makes sense they would put in extra "tickets" for him. If he plays way better than expected, they plausibly could stack it so heavily there's a near-certain chance he'd be selected, and they might be justified in doing so. No sense investigating players that aren't impacting the game.

Not saying that's what's happening here but wanted to point out an alternate, non-conspiracy explanation.
"Random"
Does he get tested any more than anyone else or does it just seem like it because he lets the world know every time it happens?
Trug? Just googled it guys. I think he's fucked. He's a professional quater back not a Pilgrim. 
It's hilarious that as old as he is, he's playing so well. For him playing well, he gets drug tested.
I mean dude is pretty swole
This is what life is like for us bald guys.
Maybe he should change his [ringtone?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5bW8H-kNZs)
Thanks for the clarification that anybody really think that this old fuck was going to replace Andrew luck?
Well if they are truly random its not impossible its just unlikely.
http://i.imgur.com/skYOFwB.gif
Could it be we live in a world where individual events happen so often that he could just be completely randomly selected over and over again? 

Why would the league want to continue to look like they're targeting him? 
He'll be fine, as long as he allows 24-48 for them to clear his system.

God damn junkies.
Would it be wrong if instead of making it random they tested just the obvious steroid takers?
"Random" sure lol 
I'm crazy and I'm on drugs, and I also think the 49ers should go after Hasselbeck and Holmgren in the offseason.

Suck it, Seahawks.  SUCK IT
Maybe they are just making sure he is taking his 'Low T' meds.
Yeah.  It's random 
Who the hell hates Matty H in that office?
Who fucking cares. His job requires random drug testing. How could anybody get upset when he gets drug tested? WHOA WHAT A SHOCKER THAT POOR GUY. 
I just want him to fail! Just once! I mean, what are the odds he's that squeaky clean? It would just blow the NFL's mind.
am I supposed to give a fuck, op?
Well, I guess we won that one.
[deleted]
That means he's played 28/80 games over the last 5 seasons. That is mind blowingly injury prone. It's a shame, because if he stayed healthy he would be one of the biggest weapons in the nfl. 
BREAKING: Percy Harvin
Thanks for those two plays in the Super Bowl!
Career. Over.
What kind of knee injury was it?
If Percy Harvin hadn't been snake bitten by injuries dude could have been incredible. Such a talent.
How's about that Jack Eichel, huh? That was a sick goal he had against Tampa the other day...


(Tries to not think about the wasted potential with Percy)
30 for 30: The Best that Never Was (Part II)
And absoluley no one is suprised, will he get cut this offseason too?
Damn..has Percy ever played a full season healthy? 
Obligatory: TJ Yates reports news now? 
If only you could see the look of surprise on my face right now. I really wish I would've listened more to Minnesota fans. No! It'll be different when he gets to Seattle! Probably the exact same thing Jets and Bills fans are saying. It's sad really. Such a promising career and dude just couldn't get out of his own way.
The NFL's insistent on trying to keep him going just goes to show how valuable good gadget players really are.

Makes me thankful that Tavon has so far proven to be durable.
RIP in peace
I had such high hopes for this season, but I guess I should know better by now.

I guess the only silver lining here is that we loaded all the money in his contract into an optional 2nd year.  Sucks to see a dude go down with injuries.  He was making things happen the couple of games we had him out there.  Passing game looked pretty good until both Sammy and Percy went down.
Well color me surprised! /s
he couldnt finish a season if you paid him!
As a hawks fan, fuck Percy Harvin. 
Lameeeeeeeeeeeeeeee I hate seeing players get hurt :/

Edit: Chip will probably sign him at some point gotta collect all the injured players and attempt to heal them with smoothies and whatnot 
fack
Percy is an incredible talent. i loved his game when we drafted him.  his weakness isnt his body.  its his mind. hes a grade A douche. 
Was the obvious risk when we signed him, sucks, he was playing well. 
Dude is going to get cut after the season.  He's a walking injury
Has he made it through a full season ever? Feel bad but maybe it isn't his thing.
One good season with Favre and now he can't stay healthy.
I think this is going to be it for Harvin. 
There's some nice flex value in Robert Woods now
needs to retire 
Did Brett Favre suck the life force out of Rice and Harvin or something? 
He would be huge right now if it wasn't for the injuries. It is a shame. 
I honestly thought this said "YASSSSS" instead of Yates and was really upset anyone would be happy someone was injured
Man! Who would've guessed that he was mr  glass in unbreakable!
It sucks. He had a ton of talent and he's done well for the Bills this year.  
That hip though, it's killing him. It sucks to see a talent like he has go out like that, but the hip injury has been a constant theme throughout his career and if he decides to retire after this year I don't think anyone would blame him.
Why does anyone even sign this guy? He's an injury prone slightly above average WR with major character issues. Career over
Thank the heavens the Jets let go and pursued Marshall. 
Just retire already.
I am shocked. 
Wow. Time to retire, Percy, you haven't done shit since your draft day. 
Fucking piece of garbage.especially since his IR may not even be injury related.  This guy has exhausted his supply of 1ups. He needs to be run out of the league. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/1vh46f/percy_harvin_will_not_play_on_sunday/cesd10x
He's a Michael Vick wide out. Genetically talented and unfortunately unmotivated. 
If you wanted to, you could buy season tickets to the Jaguars for 2 years and still have $119 left over.
Also known as : Out of my price range. 
probably the last regular season game between two of the best.

Theres like a 100 $2-$3k driving the average up. Looks like its about $350 to get in the door on stubhub but that still ain't cheap.
I very much look forward to tailgating, getting my free alcohol, getting lit, taking an uber back and watching the game at home.
I paid half that price for lower level seats to the 2013 AFC Championship game. Good lord.
That price will go up and up as well if the teams stay undefeated. 
...Thats almost the cost of a single season ticket for the Bills. Holy shit.
Man my $350 ticket to the Patriots opener is shockingly looking like a steal. 
ah, a fair and reasonable price
That price is a mile high!

&lt;.&lt;
[Average is the key word, you can still get some for the $300 range] (http://www.stubhub.com/denver-broncos-tickets-denver-broncos-denver-sports-authority-field-at-mile-high-11-29-2015/event/9298525/) 
Jesus. I hope season ticket holders don't end up selling because of that. Or they sell to Bronco fans
I camped out overnight for mine a couple months ago. Got them at face value (150 or thereabout) for 40 yard line 25 rows up
Lol fuck going to nfl games. If your team is servicably mediocre the ticket prices are so out of control that its just insanity to bother. Spending over $1,000 on going to a football game thats on television is beyond stupid for 99% of the people who end up going to those games. People spend way too much money for their income on this shit and the nfl just keeps laughing.
I feel so poor
Average cost of Lions vs Broncos game on Sunday Night Football? I don't know. No one bought my tickets... at half price. I couldn't even give them away. Oh to be a Patriots fan. I wonder what winning even feels like. 
Tickets prices start at about $330 right now. 

All the Broncos games are spendy. Vikings game was $200+ to get in the door. 

One cool thing the Broncos do is offer 2,000 half price tickets to every game. I was able to get 4 Vikings broncos tickets for less than $200. 

Manning is a huge draw locally, and legal weed is a huge draw for the away team. 

edit: [current prices](http://www.ticketexchangebyticketmaster.com/NFL/InventoryBrowse/Denver-Broncos-Tickets-at-Sports-Authority-Field-in-Denver-11-29-2015?PID=1721558)
Could be the game of the century if things continue the way they are. 
Usually I just feel lower-middle class, but now I feel broke as fuck.  That's about 100 bucks more than my mortgage and escrow payments for the month
maybe I'll go to a Jaguars Titans game or something 
Broncos vs Patriots aka: What happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object?
Yall think this is crazy? I live in Oregon and have a friend who is an insane Falcons fan. The dude bought SEASON TICKETS for the Falcons... He did go to Atlanta for the kickoff game but buying season tickets to a football team literally across the country from you while you're still in college may not be the wisest way to spend money atm.
Tvs are fantastic 
At least we now know the Pats can inflate something.
Crazy that it is now more expensive to attend a sporting event than to attend the opera or a top orchestra concert. Total flip flop from the previous generation.
Attend an NBA or MLB game. Both are much cheaper than NFL games.

And the league wonders why attendance is down.
A clipboard and safety vest are cheaper. 
I haven't been to a donks game since '06. Froze my butt off up in the nose bleed section, got beer poured on me, had no idea what was happening. The experience just plain sucked. When I look at that price, I could buy a brand new TV and fixins to throw a party. It wasn't much better for the damn packers game here. I'll Pass.
Christ man that's a decent week's pay.
I paid $320 to see the Pats-Broncos 2013 regular season game.  I thought that was very steep at the time and at halftime down 0-24 in mid 20F weather with winds swirling around making it close to 0F after wind chill, I almost started regretting my decision.

Best $320 I ever spent.
Gonna be a great game. Had the chance to grab tickets from a friend a while back. A little disappointed I didn't. 
Damn, I got a ticket to our season opener for $78.
You can complain all you want but it only costs that much because that's what people are willing to pay.
the price will plummet when the Redskins roll into Foxborough this weekend and zamboni the field with Belichick. :)
Median is more appropriate for money data like this; likely box etc seats are sky high driving up the mean. Not that the median would be cheap but id expect more in the $300 range probably...
Bought my shit back in the summer for $200, can't wait to see it 
Or you could buy a 60 inch TV and watch the game for the same price.
That's fucking stupid. I could buy a brand new TV to watch the game, tons of chicken wings and beer for my friends, fallout 4, and still have plenty of money left over. 
It will go down.  Tickets to the Pats Colts game were ~$500 until the week before when we got our tickets for $250 each
who the fuck would pay that?

I would never pay more than 100$ for any sporting event. The only exception is championship games and even then I have a limit.
I should of bought tickets when they were only 300, but i was already a month late from when the tickets went on sale.
This could very well be the last one. 
My biggest regret was not buying tickets to this game. Big Brady/Patriots fan, and me and my boy went to the Superbowl last year. Our third best friend, is a Colts fan, and big time Manning fan, and we plan yearly trips every year. Was gonna go to this game as a last hoorah for the last game of the Manning-Brady rivalry, but it was too close to Thanksgiving.

Little did I expect it to be a tale of two undefeateds and the price to be marked up. Back then the price was about 220. Fuck me.
As a CO native living in Boston, I'll be home for Thanksgiving weekend. Now I'm just thanking my lucky stars that I bought tickets to the pats game last week when our offense was still anemic.

It's gonna be the showdown of the season and I can't fucking wait. 
the only times I go to pats games is when my work buddy gets me club seat tickets at gillette. I don't know how I'd afford buying a ticket like this normally. I'm not complaining about free tickets, but its weird how some people would watch the game on the tv in the box rather than just going to the seats right outside, when the weather is pretty nice. 
If that is the price now imagine how much they would cost if both teams are undefeated. Holy shit.
Thank jebus for company tickets!
Nosebleed tickets at Lucas Oil Stadium for Peyton's return in 2013 were still like $600.00.  It was nuts.
Fuck, and I thought the Packers-Broncos game was bad enough due to them playing in Denver every 8 years. 

Hopefully this game would be a better matchup.
Glad I paid about $700 for 2 box seats on stub hub a week after they sold out
And football is the only sport I've been to that's better watching it at home. What a waste of money to go see Brady blow out a Manning led team for the 784th time. 
I hope both teams stay undefeated up to this game. That would be an epic prime time game.
Looks like I won't be going
These games never turn out the way everyone thinks they will. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective_theory_of_value
I could go to every Boston Celtics home game with that amount of doe...
I wish everyone from r/soccer would read this and then stfu about ticket prices in English football! 
Broncos you can't mess with the prophecy.  Pats will go undefeated again, only to be upset by the 9-7 Giants.

2007, 2011, 2015.

The gods have spoken, I don't know why you wont listen
Here we go!
Lmao dude fuck that. I would need to be pulling over half million to pay that. 
Why? A regular season game? 
I stopped reading at derek jeter (one of the greatest human beings alive, yea right. Morons)
New England will destroy them
Someday I'll be able to go to these games when I get season tickets.

Speaking of which, I signed up 5 years ago as #49,618 on the wait list. As of 3 days ago I'm #49,612.

At this rate I might be half way to the front by the time I retire, so $719 it is :(
Glad I bought mine during the summer.  I paid $550 for a pair in the second tier.  I'll be in the south stands so hopefully I don't die in there!
Jesus first we are deflating footballs now we are inflating ticket prices? Make up your minds people! /s
Bill Belichick obviously has somebody working in the Bronco's ticket office and wanted them to jack up the prices to discourage Denver locals from coming in to support there team.
God bless fairweather fans.
The tickets will drop when the game gets closer and no one is buying them at this price
And if they don't sell out at those prices, they'll just make it so you can't watch the game on TV.
[DeAngelo also dished out one of the most satisfying pancake blocks of the year](http://i.imgur.com/1C3ycyZ.gif)
So glad that DeAngelo is doing well for you guys. 
That was one hell of a game, I thought we would win after Carr decided he was going to will the team to glory but Brown snatched that away from us.

Awesome game.
I'm glad DeAngelo got it done on Sunday. All week, Raiders fans said that we would not be able to run the ball on their #2 ranked run defense. Looks like DeAngelo thought otherwise.
I knew Deangelo could step in and play well with Leveon out but WOW. Also Antonio is one of my favorite players not on the Patriots. Always a blessing watching you torch my secondary, sir
Who knew deangelo Williams would be one of the best pickups this offseason 
lol our defense
AB also had the highest single game rating for a wide receiver ever given by PFF
Who in 1960 had more?
Sorry it's behind a paywall, but the relevant text:   
   
&gt;"Brown and Williams combined for 531 yards from scrimmage, the most by a pair of NFL teammates since 1960. It was the first time in Steelers history that two players surpassed 200 yards from scrimmage in the same game."
Brown had 0 touchdowns. How does that even happen?
also, Steelers the first team in NFL history to have one player with at least 300 yards and another with at least 200 in the same game.
...and still won by only a field goal.
Ya... about that defense... Can I have some?
https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3s534n/antonio_brown_w9_v_oak_19_touches_306_yards/

and 

https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3s56x0/deangelo_williams_w9_v_oak_29_touches_225_yards_2/
We picked the wrong running back to get rid off
The craziest part for me is that even though they put up 500 yards we limited them to 38 points. I feel like the score could have gone into the 50s. We had, what 4 turnovers? How the hell did we still compete? 
Lev Bell the product of a great system?
raiders defense pls
goddamn this offense would be so good if not for injuries
And wasn't there no penalties until the 2nd half?

Also, i thought the comradery between the teams was excellent with players giving nods and fist bumps to opposing matchups several times.


How Antonio Brown went in the 6th round is beyond my understanding
AND BOTH ON MY FANTASY TEAM! WOOO!
If they can get Ben back and healthy in time for the playoffs and these two can somewhat keep their production rate this high, they are going to be extremely scary in the playoffs. 
Colin Kaepernick tied off his bindle, slung it over his shoulder, looked his turtle Sammy in the eyes and said, "Sammy, it's time for another adventure." He then hopped on his turtle and flew away.
Wait. A 49ers QB is available? Sign me up!
This article makes it seem like Kaepernick and the 49ers organization had a falling out. They say that rebuilding their relationship is essentially "a lost cause" and that his teammates think he's going to request a trade. You know an organization is just going total downhill when your once future franchise quarterback doesn't even want to be there and his teammates see it too. 
Hello mid 2000s, nice to see you again
Hou7ton?
Even Kaepernick can't afford to keep paying rent in San Francisco. 
Thank God, kid doesn't deserve that shit
Don't the Chiefs usually retain dibs in these situations?
God dammit anyone but the Eagles please
Cowboys backup?  No one is happy with Weeden or Cassel
Honestly I'm convinced that York is just trying to ditch anyone on the team that reminds the fans that Harbaugh used to be their coach. Buckle up, it's gonna be a rough few seasons in Santa Clara
Man everyone is shitting on Kap in this thread but I honestly feel for the guy. I understand if you feel that he was overhyped, but he still worked his ass off and silently stuck with a dysfunctional front office for a year and a half. Yeah, he seems to be egotistical and is a social media disaster, but give the guy some credit.
I still think both Kaep and RG3 will be successful QBs with someone. They just need to find organizations that aren't *completely* dysfunctional.
Am I the only one who wants to see 4 16-0 teams this season?  Fuck the 72 dolphins.  Edit: wrong thread but I stand by this.
49ers continuing to make the worst decisions for their team in the league 
I see they're using the Redskins model for ruining a QB
"It's not you, it's us."

-49ers
Wherever he ends up, I'll be rooting for him.
He won't start again this season. 

 1-15 

:sigh:
Makes sense. 

He had the mythical *first year bench development* and stepped into a really comfortable situation his first two years where he had a defense and running game that could support him. 

He did the off-season work outs and mechanics training and film study and this year even checked off the *train with a retired HoF QB* box. 

But he still can't manage pressure, can't see receivers about to come open, and as a result can't throw with anticipation and needs to be schemed into designed throws and easy reads and you just can't run an offense like that at this level. 

Defenses are blatantly disregarding and disrespecting him as a passer, leaving receivers uncovered and playing man-up cover zero and daring him to throw the football and he just can't challenge them unless they are starting a guy like Shareece Wright, who couldn't even make our active list. 

Now with all that great supporting cast gone the 49ers need him to be the leader and the driver of success on offense and he never developed into a QB capable of that. 

There are absolutely coaching issues in San Francisco and offensive line issues in San Francisco, but there are serious QB issues as well. 

5 years into his career, it's probably time to stop waiting on him to develop as a passer and move on. 
The era of the meme qb is over. They've all been exposed
1 Kaepernick please
http://i.imgur.com/LBAxNPt.gif
Chip, you know what to do
What if Detroit and San Francisco swapped QBs
And this was written before Gabbert threw two TDs in the first half against Atlanta.
Broncos might be in the market for a new QB next season depending on what Peyton decides at the end of this one. (If I am recalling correctly, his is a 1 year contract in Denver)

Where else do people think Kap might land? Sorry if I missed this talk elsewhere.
I think he'll probably end up on the Jets next season. If not them, then Buffalo.
COME TO CLEVELAND!!!!!!!!!!!
Come on, Chip.

Do it.
I'll always be a Kap supporter, no matter where he ends up. Same as Alex Smith. 

Kap has much more potential than that dumpster fire team. It's actually pretty sad to watch the management just run a once respected team into the ground. What a damn shame.
If he's gone its not because of performance, shitty though he's been this year. It's because York doesn't want to spend any unnecessary money.  If the team is going to suck why spend money on a QB.  
It's probably the best thing for Kap to get out of there.
Just thought i'd post this here. It's an aricle from Derrik Klassen, a great QB analyst and writer from the end of 2014 talking about some of Kaepernick's strengths, issues, and how he's been scapegoated by some people as the source of his teams problems. If Kaepernick is released, this piece should give you a brighter idea of what you're getting from him in case your team enters the conversation for picking him up.

http://www.footballsavages.com/colin-kaepernick-scapegoat/
I would love the Texans to give this kid a shot. 
Good, they don't deserve a QB after how they treated Alex Smith. I'm super glad he's doing well in KC.
I'm betting he goes to the Eagles. Hoping he does well
Hey!  Wanna come hang out with Tony for a few years? 
The Jets wouldn't fuck you over too badly... come join the Green
Honestly I think it's for the better. Jim Harbaugh took a jab at 49ers coaching and thinks its the coaching that's making Kaepernick play the way he is.
I'd like to give the guy a chance on another team as he did show a fuckton of potential at one point. Plenty of comeback stories in the NFL, why can't he be another?
Part of me is sad because he's one of my favorite player, but I'm happy he'll be able to go to a team that treats him well and he can succeed (hopefully), he deserves a lot better than this
I saw that stat this week that him and Newton have the same QBR, but Kaep has four times as many sacks. One is benched, one is being talked about as MVP. 
I'm all for the lobster starting,  but I think Kaep in a Kubiak offense could be special
What will be the plan at quarterback moving forward then? Paxton, Goff, and Cook, the top 3 quarterback prospects, are not pro-ready based on the most recent prospect evaluations.  
He's gonna go Tim Tebow on the NFL it seems. 
Good. Fucking GOOD.  Kap has so much potential and so much athleticism and he's dying in this dumpster fire of a season. He deserves to go somewhere that'll actually give him a chance and a career.  I'm starting to think Frank Gore and all the retirees are the smartest people in SF football right now.
He's better than our backups. Dibs. 
Doesn't Denver use a pistol/shotgun hybrid thing in their offense? Manning ain't getting younger. Maybe he'll head over there.
If you would have asked the 49ers franchise if Kaepernick was a worthwhile player just a few months ago they would have said absolutely.

9 games later and they are going to cut him. Christ I was never that high on the guy, but reactionary thinking like this will NEVER lead to good things.
Plenty of open doors for him, I think he'll find a new home pretty quick.
Fuck it. 
Honestly, would be cool to see him in Philly. 
Thats why I am all for players making the money when they can. Kaep got one of the worst deals out there. Hopefully he can get his career back on track with better coaching.

Hope he does not end up with the Bills.
I think a change of scenery is needed for him. He was Jim's guy. Jim wanted him over Alex Smith and now Kap is the new Alex. Let the Niners find the guy they want and another team will make a play for Kap.
Ya'll got any more of them quarterbacks? 
Good for the niners. 
Kaep might end up on a team where he'll flourish. He has all the physical tools, and has proven he can play at an elite level.
Keep lacking in the whole decision making skills. When he throws the ball, he either throes it fast or faster. Literally no touch to it.
shotty!!
Kaep goes to Philly to lead an option dragon to the Superbowl
What are the chances he lands in philly?
Kaep to Eagles confirmed.
Probably the for the best. I really hope he can succeed somewhere else, I think he has a lot of potential, but he would be wasting his time any longer in the Titanic Reenactment  that is San Francisco
No surprise. He is Harbaugh's guy

He's as good as gone.

Can't *wait* to see how our FO handles this one!
Dammit he might actually go to a good team and turn it around now
Mutually beneficial. 

Kaep needs a new organization to bring him back to where he was, and the 49ers need to move on to the next guy. Better for them to sign a sturdy vet to man the ship while they rebuild the team they just dismantled over the past two seasons. 
This is exactly why people were surprised when he signed that contract. He basically signed a contract that had no guaranteed money and the team can cut him at anytime. It's stupid how team friendly some NFL contracts are.

&gt;6/4/2014: Signed a seven-year, $126.97 million contract. The deal contains $61 million guaranteed, although only $13.073 was guaranteed at signing -- a $12,328,766 signing bonus, Kaepernick's 2014 base salary, and a $100,000 first-year workout bonus. Kaepernick's 2015-2017 base salaries are guaranteed only for injury. Kaepernick is eligible for annual $2 million per-game roster bonuses and offseason workout bonuses of $400,000 in years two through seven. 2015: $12.4 million, 2016: $13.9 million, 2017: $16.5 million, 2018: $17 million, 2019: $18.8 million, 2020: $21 million, 2021: Free Agent

Will 49ers fans miss him?
Good
Mind as well sign him with Paul Johnson and run the option with Gurley right?
I'd like to see him on the Jets or Texans.

He'd be an upgrade to Fitz and (especially) Geno on the jets, an upgrade to Hoyer in Houston, and both of those offenses seem like Kaep would fit in well.
Move the f*cking trade deadline back.
They would have to find a trade partner or eat a ton of Kap space, I don't get it.
Fine, FINE!  We'll take him!
As long as his confidence isn't totally shot so he can't get his 2012-2013 fundamentals back, he should be fine if he can find a good situation (team) to go to. 

They have to look at the times he has been successful with the 9ers and do the exact same thing...basically it seems like he should go to the Eagles. 

Give him a heavy successful run game, design a passing attack that emphasizes his strengths and avoids his weaknesses, and get him running early every game, use his ability to run every single game.

Games with him at QB should end with a stat line like:

- ~60% completion rate with 25 total passes. ~175 yards 

- 25-30 hand-offs to the RBs

- 5 QB runs for ~30 yards 

- 1-2 passing TD's and once in a while a rushing TD. 


Anything else is misusing him. Do not give him too much to do, do not ask him to read the entire field, do not ask him to make amazing decisions. But he can be a winning QB in the NFL with the right team, the right offense, the right coaching staff, and the right expectations. 

He could certainly have a viable career as a backup.
He's going to the Pats. Belichick will turn him into a top QB next season.
Remember when Kaepernick vs Newton was a debate?
Go get 'im, Chip.
What a genius contract that was. They owe him nothing, right? Man, I'd be so pissed at my agent if I was him that he didn't get more guaranteed. Who wants Kaepernick? I guess he'll get another job with how bad QBs are in the league right now but he's been garbage for 2 years. 
I go where ever Kap goes.
My dad (Browns Fan) says he'd love for Cleveland to take him. 
He's actually already back right now!!
So he's going to Cleveland to die like all qbs?
I'll take "headlines you never thought you'd see" for 1000, Alex 
He's no Gabbert, would take an injury or something.
Cant wait to see Mario-- Kaepernick on the EAGLES!!!!
Come backup TyGod please. As long as I never have to watch EJ take another snap. 
I predict a competition between him and Osweiler in Denver next year.
Is Blaine really that good?
Lucky guy. 
Minnesota can use some depth at qb 
Can't blame him, the ship was sinking in the off-season and is now resting on the bottom.
Well this is awkward now...
He is in the game right now
my friend said 

he's going to wear this kap jersey for next Halloween
Dear Collin, Philly is nice this time of year....
He would be a good fit in Philly.
How many years does Eli have in him? Do we have QB to be grooming?
Could see him in Philly?
god...after ONE game!?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this going to mess with the 49ers cap for a few seasons after if he's released? 

If they need to move him, I can't see any team willing to trade for him knowing what kind of money is tied to him.
Probably lands with the Jets/Eagles/Bills. Guarantee it. 
No shit, I really hope he can find success somewhere else.
as a nevada student it sucks watching him struggle but if he lights it up somewhere else..
I just don't know anymore man... Everything has gone to shit
Stay out of Houston plz, thx.
Well yeah.
Oddly enough, I can't think of any teams on which he'd make sense. You'd think Washington, but it seems more likely that they'd draft a new QB. Maybe the Bears, but Jay Cutler seems to always do just enough to secure another year there.
Kaepernick for RGIII confirmed
Lol remember when ESPN said he was one the nfl elites QBS?


Kaepernick is a window dressing QB, he's not a foundation guy. If you have every aspect of your house built and just need some blinds, Kaepernick will fill that need beautifully. If you need a guy that can be a cornerstone, a team leader, and a guy that makes other's around him better, Kaepernick is not your guy.

There are a few teams that are some window dressing away from having a great house, the question is how many have $15mill per year to spend on them.
I thought he was supposed to be the next big thing? The quarterback of the future? A season or 2 ago they were hyping this guy up everywhere. 
Before last year, I'd want the Raiders to get him.  He can be great, I really believe that 

At this point, I want him to go to the Pats, take over for Brady (obs when he's done), and prove people wrong.  
So 49'r fans tell me how important a good coach is to a team.
I actually would be cool with having Kaepernick after Peyton retires.
Annnnnd now he's in the game for the 49ers
Houston get hype
Not quite the 7torm I was expecting
Can Kaepernick play TE? 

Maybe RGIII can cover him on the scout team and crack the starting roster as a Safety finally? 
7torm subsides
Wow. The harbaugh team is now gone. The 49ers organization has completely shit the bed and its embarrasssing. I hope Jed York gets cancer of the worst kind.anal cancer. Slow and agonizing death, but faster then the death he's putting the Niners fans through. 
We'll see if he can be more than a gimmick QB....
I'm glad he's leaving. I went to the University of Nevada and the only legit player to ever come out of there is Colin but I can't root for him on the 49ers. I have told my friends time and time again that I don't want him to succeed on the 49ers. If he leaves I will be happy to root for him as long as he stays out of the AFC West. Just like Peyton Manning. I used to love him on the Colts, but fuck Bronco Peyton Manning.
Whoa, we can only have one 49ers backup at a time. Better give kaep a couple more years.
CK to Miami. He and his turtle down on south beach and the Everglades and a guaranteed spot on Ballers season 2.

Plus not many other spots are open, Cleveland? Detroit (if MS rumors are true). The real wildcard would be LA, would a Gurley Kaep connection be worth a shot?
Dibs 
I want Kaep.

I wish he wouldn't have gotten a stupid contract.
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Really excited to see the excuses his new team's fanbase comes up with for his deficiencies. 
I'll take him over Webb and an aging Anderson.   I don't have to pick up his contract right? ;I
Congrats, Buffalo. You've found your QB. 
[deleted]
Him, RG3 might get one last chance since the league is so weak. Johnny Manziel might get a chance for the Browns but I doubt he will start more than 16 games in his career
Honest question here: How did Kaep take the team to the Super Bowl? Also, is Super Bowl a proper noun?
I fucking love this offense.

Draft next year:

R1 - DB

R2 - DB

R3 - DB

R4 - LB

R5- LB

R6- LB

R7 - DB
He's been balling out this year. Seems to be living up to his potential in Oakland. 

I'm not sure if it's the difference in QB, scheme, or just a change of scenery that did it, but he and Carr are nearly as exciting to watch as Carr and Cooper. 
Carr is a great QB, and the kind of QB that Crabtree needs. Hope he signs an extension with Oakland.
Carr, Crabtree, &amp; Cooper. OH MY!
Funny reading all the comments in this thread now http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3kq4ei/michael_crabtree_i_needed_new_scenery_it_wasnt/ 
Amari Cooper is as well.
I'm not gonna like this division once Manning retires and it turns out Osweiller isn't very good.
I think he's a really good #2. Obviously having Amari Cooper on the other side has drawn much DB attention away and Carr is good at making them pay. San Francisco has recently been a team with 3 #2 receivers but no 1. 
I've mentioned it a couple times, but I went to Tech when he was there and he was an absolute baller. I know everything doesn't translate to the pros, especially considering the spread style offense we ran under Leach, but something seemed wrong about his time at the 49ers. He used to get a lot more intermediate and slant routes in college and they worked well for him. He used to be known for having a really good radius to catch the ball. I'm glad he's finally finding a groove. 
http://i.imgur.com/78wGBVa.png
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

Crabtree needs to play on some sort of Raider team to play well.

Did well as a Red Raider, now he's doing well as an Oakland Raider.

Very simple stuff, shameful no else has figured it out.
I hope he's grateful for us giving him a chance, I hope he repays us by signing a new contract and not leaving for the next hot thing that shows him interest.
Well even though he didn't really care for us, good job Crab. Tear it up in Oak town
I will be really disappointed if we don't lock him down for at least another year, he is really thriving with us. 
I legitimately thought he'd have a bounce back year but not on this level. 

He's signed to a one year deal, correct? Dudes gonna get paid
He went from Red Raider to Oakland Raider. It's the Raider Power doing it. 
Does this mean that Crabtree and Kaepernick were not a good fit at all, and that this career year is because Carr is infinitely better?

Because I know Kapernick constantly throwing 100mph fastballs don't help.
I mean if you look at his career, it isn't surprising. He held out his first year, then he had another year with Alex Smith as QB, it wasn't until Kaepernick took over when he started doing really well. The next year he got the achilles injury and after in his final year with the Niners, the offense was a clusterfuck as a whole. The Raiders offense best suits him right now.
A lot of homer 49ers fans were crapping on him for suggesting some of his performance issues were due QB issues. Let's face it, QB's are the bigger part of the equation. The 49ers need a pocket passer too.
As an overall fan who's watched the Raiders turn into an Organization whose players went for their careers to die post-2002, it's nice to see them not only relevant, but a good team.  They've drafted outstanding the past 2-3 years.  They've got the talent in place to surprise some people, and will only get better
He is targeted so much more in the Raiders offense then he ever was with the Niners. He is on pace for 160 targets if he plays all 16 games which is far more than in [any season as a Niner.] (http://espn.go.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/12563/michael-crabtree)

Hes playing for a QB whos better then any other hes had and also being targeted much more often. It's no surprise at all hes headed for a career year. 
Wasn't his salary ridiculously low compared to what people THOUGHT an extension would be? Glad to see this offense doing so damn well. It's kind of scary how fast the turnaround is, to be honest.
That's my sorry ass receiver :'-)
Amazing what one year has done for the raiders, and they only stand to get better.
The Raiders just keep getting better each week. Its a shame the season may not be long enough to help them.
Well yah... he doesn't have Kaep throwing him the ball anymore.
Guy has been a fucking beast so far this year.
Ironically he left and SF is horrible offensively. 
But according to Richard Sherman, Crabtree is a "sorry reciever." Lol
Everyone is saying crabs is #2 and Coop is #1 but crabs is getting more looks and targets. 
He is finally healthy again, and having Cooper on the other side really takes a lot of pressure off. Hopefully for the Raiders this isn't a contract year thing, where he ends up getting a big deal and then doesn't care anymore. I don't miss him on the 49ers, but I'm really happy to see that he's doing well.
Oh, doing well on the team that should have instead drafted him in the first place? 
That's what happens when you have a QB
crabtree is pretty damn good when on a good offense. saw this already in the 49ers '12 season where he had 1,105 yds receiving and 9 td, 1,390/12 counting playoffs.
Yeah, of course he is. And when the niners let him go, the majority of the fanbase was saying "good riddance" and talking about how he was far past his prime anyway. Hmm...
And he's killing it for me in fantasy
Continuing what everyone else has said but having Carr has been great for him. He has already had 80 targets through 8 games (on pace for 160) when  only once did he have more than 120 (127). 160 targets would have been 4th best last year and his 80 this year is tied for 12th overall. Crabtree is definitely getting more looks and being put into a situation where he can show his skills 
...which doesn't mean much since he's always been a mediocre receiver http://www.burkmont.com/2014/04/just-how-mediocre-is-michael-crabtree.html
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU PUT A SORRY RECEIVER LIKE CRABTREE IN OAKLAND
I got down voted to when I mentioned it was a qb issue. The everyone told me how he wouldn't be getting an upgrade with Carr. What now? 
I miss you YACtree :'(
I really like Crabtree. Always have. I was bummed to see him go to Oakland, 'cause I thought his career was over... instead, Oakland looks like a legit team, and Crabtree's killing it. It's great to see!
More proof it's Kaepernick who is the problem. 
Good thing he doesn't play against Richard Sherman again for a long time.
Thanks for this sorry-ass receiver. 
I'm happy that he found a good fit with the Raiders, he looks like he belongs for the first time in a while.
Who would have thought you would read that in 2015
ME-DI-OCRE
Well it's great timing for him. Somehow is going to drop a boatload of cash for his services.
But Richard Sherman said Crabtree is a sorry ass receiver...
Ugh this is bittersweet
Yeah thats what happens when you get healthy and dont give up on your team

Amazing
No surprise, really. Crabtree looked good on film often even in his last 49ers seasons. Just wasn't in a good offensive scheme or with Quarterbacks that fit his skills. 
He wasn't kidding when he said he needed a gunslinger at QB.
he's projected for 94/1182/10

quite impressive
Mediocre never looked so good, helps to have a QB that's playing lights out.
Crabtree is a sorry receiver
Michael "Happy Little" Crabtree
He was on a team with low low passing volume and didn't have the skills to et open as a #1. 

Now he's on a team that prefers to go through the air and has Amati cooper to handle the #1 coverages and double teams.

This shouldn't be some incredible moment. Crabtree is a great #2 behind a real #1. Same as he could have been on the 49ers.
It humors me the he's excelling on the team that should have drafted him. Although it's in a different situation, still funny
Still an asshat of a person
Ehh... Mediocre at best.
The "I finally have a quarterback who can hit me farther than 10 yards down the field" effect.
Well when you've been mediocre your whole life and you step up once you'll sign the brightest. -Sherman
 Still mediocre 
Amazing what he can do with a good QB.. Alex Smith TRASH Keap Trash but now he has a baller
It's crazy watching him and remembering that he had an achilles injury, doesn't even look like its affected him
Have they played the Seahawks yet?
Pretty good for a sorry-ass receiver.
Mediocre ;^)
Dang I cut him from my fantasy team at the wrong time SMH 
Feels good not to face the Seahawks twice a year. Bitchtree finally making good.
He doesn't have to play Sherman and Peterson 4 times a year. 
And still cheap as hell on fanduel
That not really saying all that much. Only time this dude will be going to Honolulu  anytime soon is for family vacation
dropped him for lafell, I'm not as mad as I could be. Like the guy that dropped deangelo and lost by 20
Raiders will lose to the Vikings this weekend.
Have we seen the last Brady v Manning? 
Finally, the crustacean kind will get their revenge against the cruelty of New England.  You've seen plenty of seafood, Patriots, but you haven't ever seen a 6'8" Lobster.

Edit: If you don't know why he's called Lobster, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDZy6-fMCw4
Raise ur claws, lower ur parms
If I were a broncos fan I'd be good with this decision
Osweiler v Brady I 
The whole wait until Manning gets healthy line and that they'll go week-by-week was pretty ridiculous from the start. A torn Plantar Fascia doesn't heal in week or two.
[Come on down Brock Lobster](http://i.imgur.com/GfJNU68.gif)
You always gotta worry about a young quarterback going against a confusing defense like the Patriots, but he still probably gives us the best chance of winning
Can you imagine the hype train if Denver gets the W
This is going to be such an awesome game. I am stoked to see what he does with this opportunity.

Thankfully I don't have to hear about the 58th meeting of Brady vs. Peyton all pregame. Although I'm sure the broadcasters will talk about it anyway. 
Damn I wanted Peyton
Good. Unless Manning is 100% healthy, Brock should be starting
Probably for the best. I'm pretty sure last year was the last Peyton v Brady we'll see. 
Well it's for the best. Not only was Peyton struggling mightily, but Osweiller can be used in the offense Kubiak prefers
I am very excited for this new era for the Broncos. It's always fun to see young backups get their first starts and play well. So stoked for this game.
RIP Brady/Manning Bowls.
What if brock leads them to a super bowl? Srs question. Like peyton puts his ego aside, starts becoming a mentor to brock and lets his team get him his last ring before he retires without him having to put on pads... That would be a feel good movie for the holidays
If Brockafeller Center beats Brady, does Manning just go ahead and retire in the post game presser?
As he should
Honestly this is the smartest move. Belichick is a master of gameplanning and there's almost no film on Osweiler and so much on Manning. Let alone a Manning with an incredibly limited arm
So much for "MANNING VS. BRADY NEXT WEEK ON NBC"
I'm excited to see how Brady performs against the Broncos defense. 

Of course I'm also excited to see how Osweiler performs. One game sample ain't much, but he performed well. 
I can't wait for the Lobster to make chowder out of the Patriots. 
Brady's first victory as a starter came against the Manning-led Colts. Brock's first meaningful one will come against Brady's Patriots. Circle of life confirmed.
Kubiak: decision to start Osweiler based on Manning's health. "Nothing has changed...We think this is best for Peyton &amp; our football team."

Is Sanders gonna be back for this game? 
Goodnight Brady v Manning XVII
We should have kept it a secret all week, so the Pats had to prepare for 2 diff QB's and offenses
I remember a few weeks back the ticket sales going through the roof for what could be the last Brady-Manning Bowl. I find it funny all those people who spent that money now get the Brady-Brock Bowl.

Manning isn't coming back.
I think we should put in Jimmy for the first quarter just because the thought of Jimmy v Brock is amazing.
Wow crazy. How do Denver fans feel?
It's still gonna be good. Lobster balled out yesterday
I hope it's a shootout.

Where the west wins, sucka!
end of an amazing rivalry :'-(
Better chance for the Broncos, Belichick has no way of knowing how Osweiler will play them.
He earned it. 
[Broncos fans to Manning](https://youtu.be/grbSQ6O6kbs)

Mike Florio is just a clickbaity asshole
If the pat's D-line shows up with hot melted butter we could be in trouble
I'm waiting for Peyton to ~~attack Brock with a steel chair. Incapacitating Brock with one strike to his left knee.~~ appear and give Brock a Nationwide jingle.
If the Broncos beat the Pats with Brock leading the way, they pretty mch have to bench Petyon for the rest of the season, right?
This should be Peyton's last game, im happy they are using Borck so i can finally hate them the proper way.
Fuck you Broncos.

Thank God. I hope it's Brock time from here on out.
I see this being the Pats first loss.
Mort lies.
Bill is probably already locking his chops.
FOR THOSE ABOUT TO BROCK 
RAISE YOUR PINCERS!

Welcome to the Abrockalypse, New England!
Swiggity swooty Brock...
We love to feast on lobster up here in New England. This'll be... *delicious*. Good luck, Brock.
Pretty hard to justify playing Manning after Brock's performance. 
Gonna be fascinating to see how he handles facing the Patriots in his second start.

If he plays well, even if the Broncos lose he should be the starter for the rest of the year.
This is the best decision i guess. But i hope Manning can be back to the playoffs and face Belichick and Brady one last time
Is there any word on Ware yet? 
Thank god. I was afraid we were going to start Peyton just because it's the patriots and the Peyton/Brady rivalry. 
Hey everyone remember this from two weeks ago? - [*Average ticket to upcoming Pats-Broncos ... $719*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/3rouas/average_ticket_to_upcoming_patsbroncos_719/)

Going back and reading the comments is sad/hilarious. 


As a pats fan living in Denver, this makes me a little sad.
May be a dumb question, but why would Kubiak say this? Doesn't it give Belichek more of a preparation advantage? Just don't tell the media anything that week and tell your players in private.

Just shut down Manning for the season 
In Brock Lobster we hope.
Hashtag Montana Native Brock Osweiler.
TIME TO ROCK OUT WITH YOUR BROCK OUT DENVER 
I kind of feel bad for the people paying $700+ see this game if they got their ticket to see the final Manning vs Brady matchup.
if this is coming from mort there is no way to know if its true or not. 
I hope we can still field a team by then.
No reason he shouldn't, Manning needs to heal, a week does not do that. Also, this is a huge test for his future. I am looking forward to this game. 
RAISE YOUR PINCERS
Well, we still could see them go in the playoffs. I fully expect Peyton to play again this year and Elway made this decision with the big picture in mind. Peyton needs to heal up. 
Dang, was hoping to see 1 more Peyton vs Brady. 
I believe as long as Peyton Manning is alive, who is starting for the Broncos will be "news" and even then, I'm not sure he won't return from the grave to get another shot at it.
This was reported by Chris "Making Shit Up" Mortensen, so I'm fully expecting Peyton to play.

Choo choo 16-0 here we come
Peyton didn't go to Chicago or help Brock out at the QB meetings right?
As a Chargers fan, 75% of me can't wait to see the Broncos get shredded. But then the other 25% is sitting here thinking "shit, if they win, the media's going to take their lips right off Manning's dick and place it firmly on Brock Lobster's, and we're going to be stuck with another era of way too much Bronco coverage."       
Please don't lose, Brady.
Brady is 0-5 in Denver when playing the starting QB. 2-0 vs the backup. I have a feeling that will change next Sunday. 
The Patriots are going to bend him over the barrel and show him the 50 states if you know what I mean.
Loss # 3 for Broncos.  Will be a close game though. 
Dat 11-0 tho.
Watch Osweiler-Manning be the Broncos version of Brady-Bledsoe
This kills the lobster 
They're calling it Surf V. Turf.  I'll let you figure out why.
Pats gonna eat this lobster for dinner.... He had it easy vs a banged ups bears D last week.... Also did you guys know he is six foot eight and played basketball?!
I am disappointed honestly by a lot of these Broncos fans in here but the Broncos organization has to do what is best for their team. I am all for Brock starting from here on out if he plays well, regardless of the results of games though.

[Peyton be like] (http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/016/212/manning.png)
Never thought I'd see such an uproar about a ref getting a call right. They just can't win. 

Won't someone think of the referees? 
I love Peko, but this was dumb of him. And it's time to stop talking about it. The first thing we should be talking about is how you let them move 60 yards, in 70 seconds, with no time outs. 

Fuck all the bullshit about the call (and it was a good call by the refs) time to talk about letting them score 21 unanswered points in the 2nd half, or letting them move at will on the final drive. Get those things right first, guys.
Rex did this two years ago, when the Patriots were using illegal pushes on field goals. Then, at the end of the game, the refs nabbed Chris Jones for it on what would have been a 56-yard attempt for the Jets. 15 yards for unsportsmanlike; Nick Folk chip shot for a Jets win.

IMO it's just fair play to call out your opponent's illegal plays. Not really a matter of "everyone does it" if *your* team isn't and the other team is, and you can help the refs catch it in the act.
I missed it. What happened and what was the issue exactly?
I dunno why anyone is up in arms over this. It's a penalty. I was more surprised by the non call after Bucannon launched himself helmet to helmet into Green. Even Collinsworth pointed it out for Christsake! 

Edit: werds 
Go ahead and shit on the Bengals, they deserve this one. That's some stupid shit that you learn not to do in peewee football. I love my Bengals, but fuck that's stupid.
My question is: As a defensive player at the line of scrimmage, can you purposefully make noise, to make the 'set, go' inaudible for OLineman?  In college, Ohio State QB's clap their hands once to signal for the ball to be spiked.  In a game earlier in the year, a defensive player on every play, ran up to the line of scrimmage and clapped his hands repeatedly to try to 'mimic' or throw off the Center to QB snap.  No foul was called.  Now I know college and NFL rules differ significantly, but is this rule strictly for imitating the QB or just the words?  Could you make an argument that the specific words were changed, therefore it's ok?  Is it only a penalty if you say 'Omaha' against Peyton, what if it were changed to 'Lincoln'?
The Defender claims he was yelling "get set, get set" in an attempt to alert his squad to a coming run play, with 8 seconds on the clock, and with the Card's out of time outs.  Makes no sense.  Why would Ari. march all the way down there with under a minute to go only to run out what little time was left with a run play?   Lewis co-signing that business is sad.  His player, and thereby his team, was up to no good, got caught, and still claims innocence in the face of what the rest of the football world understands is the case.  Such an insult to everyone else's intelligence is about as unintelligent as they can get.  
It was the first time I've ever seen it called. Definitely not something the refs could notice unless they're told to look out for it
Marvin Lewis and the handful of whiny Bengals fans have been acting silly, this was a totally legit call. It's childish, you lost, lose with some grace. 

With that said, all of the Bengals fans at the game were really cool. The Bengals had the best fans of any visiting team we've ever hosted. I've probably been to about 40 games at UoPS and I've never encountered a better group of fans. 
BOOM. I love it. Fitzgerald even said in an interview that they were doing it all game. The new ref positioning though puts him right back of the lineup inside 2 minutes so he close enough to hear it for himself. Dudes were cheating and still gave up 30 points. 
Oh this will go over well. Are we welcome to join your "-Gate" club now Colts?
Is there a video of this?
Can someone explain this to me? I'm not aware of the rule and couldn't watch the final minutes of the game.
Wait so what actually happened? Was the defense just saying what the QB says when he wants to snap the ball?
I mean ... if you get caught doing something like this it kinda makes it your own fault. Idk what argument there is for the Bengals' side.
#CADENCEGATE
Texans are shitty enough of a team where we don't get the respect of even being Cadenced. That shows the kind of respect the Cardinals demand.
Are Bengals fans actually salty about the refs getting the call right and being caught cheating?
So what exactly happened?
Odds on the Bengals trying this next week?
Dirty cheap crap football. I'm so glad they paid for it at all he most critical time. 
I cannot believe how much bitching there is over getting called on being a cheater and breaking a rule they have known since pee-wee football. 

Bengals fans as a group are looking like ridiculous whiners right now. They get called out for trying to cheat and then try to blame it on everyone but themselves for trying to cheat. 

Man their sub is a joke right now.

&gt;[#AZCardinals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23AZCardinals) had alerted officials that [#Bengals](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Bengals) had been mimicking cadence earlier in game, so they were watching for it on final play.

The sad part is the Bengals trying to pretend they didn't get caught doing what they did.  They broke the rules, got caught and it cost them the game.  Own up to it and move on.
Frustrating listening to all these bengals fans talking like this was a garunteed win. The cardinals are 8-2 they're a good team and they beat the bengals fair and square. They actually looked better to be honest.
Cadencegate 2015
Amendola is clutch as fuck

Edit: Hahaha
As someone who didn't see the game, can someone explain what happened?
No way. It must just because they have bassy voices.
CadenceGate!!!!
is Lewis from the belicek tree? 
[deleted]
What is mimicking cadence? Why is this not allowed?
ELI5?
I want a video of the Bengals being so desperate to win that the defense has to mimic Palmers snap count.

I wonder if they have been doing this all season.
Thank fuck based McCourty
Uhoh! I vote we do a 5 million dollar investigation into whether or not the team was cheating. I want cell phone evidence! Did the qb know about itm The the coach know about it? I want them interviewed. Not once not twice. 3 interviews. By a weird mustached man who will look through your phone. 
Looks like the patriots have some competition
I'm still confused what he did that was illegal... and why it was illegal
Who's the Bills LT? Handling Jones pretty well.

Edit: oops
Can we join the -gated community now?
so wheres #mimickgate, theres actual documented proof of a team cheating and getting away with it and finally getting caught, best double standard in football, if this was the pats this would get millions in fines, removal of the player from the league and draft picks and games turned over, funny fuckin league were in here so far, 10/10 guys. sweep it under the rug, provide 0 consistency.
I'm not saying it was okay, but if they were doing it earlier in the game and the refs knew and didn't call anything, it seems kinda shitty that they call it on the last play. 
Remember that time the St Louis Cardinals hacked into another team's server and we never heard about it again? Cheating is simply a matter of [perception](http://i.imgur.com/PM1PHWV.jpg).
The weekly excuses for the refs blowing a game again, every Monday.
So come up with a better cadence 
First time we have been a favorite since Week 4 2014 I believe 
Imagine hearing this 2 weeks ago. 
The NFC North has quietly become one of the most exciting divisions this year. The Bears are nipping at the heels of the Packers and the Vikings.
Cutler is playing really well and the Broncos are trending down right now. Makes sense.
I'm really surprised that the Broncos are dogs against the Bears. Peyton was bad (albeit not last Sunday bad) all year long and even if Brock plays poorly he'll probably play about as well as Peyton did on average... and that defense hasn't gone anywhere.
What a time to be alive
I don't think people should use File Transfer Protocol to predict game winners.
I want to go back to being the underdogs. Life is so much more fun when you're winning as the underdog. Now we got lofty expectations here trying to defeat a really good Broncos team even without Manning.
Bears are at home, on a win streak and facing a first time quarterback. This isn't rocket science.
Can you imagine how hard you would have laughed at this in week 4?
Denver became it's own trap game.
FTP
Here's a direct link to all the spreads this week

https://i.imgur.com/ELIrAze.jpg
Love when we are getting points, I hope this gets up to 3 by Sunday.
The last time we were underdogs we sent the other team out of the building onto a losing streak. Here's to hoping Broskter can not turn the ball over and generate a few TD's
Lots of people are probably pouring money on Chicago right now because they think Brock will suck. Personally, I think they're very wrong.
The Broncos haven't been underdogs vs a team with a losing record (outside of September) since 2011 http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201112040min.htm
Hopefully coming in as the underdogs lights a fire under them the same way it did when they faced the Packers.
If anyone had said this 4 weeks ago people would have laughed them off the internet
This game will rest on brock's lobster claws. If our offense can manage to not turn the ball over 3+ times and put up a few TD's before garbage time, we have a good shot. Not to mention we will probably be rolling out Kubiak's offense instead of the hybrid Manning/Kubiak offense
Talib coming back makes the Bronco's defense whole again. I can't imagine them losing this (but i certainly hope they do). 
I'm pretty sure the Broncos will win this game.  If Peyton Manning were still the QB though, I'd take the Bears.
FTP as a Bears fan means something much more meaningful. 
The darkest of timelines. 
What's surprising is how unsurprised I am by this. 
fox, fangio, gase, cutler, pace.

cannot say enough about those five guys
No matter how you cut it. 2 weeks ago Denver was ranked 2nd and Chicago was 33rd. Even with the absence of manning, it's kind of insane to be in this situation now
FTP indeed.
You know, the Packers were favorites in our game too.....
What world are we living in.
If you said the Bears would be favored over the Broncos three weeks ago you would have been laughed out of here before you could hit post. But here we are. 
We need this win to sweep that whole division. It would be priceless
Just placed my largest ever bet on Denver.
Home field is usually worth 3 points so Vegas thinks on a neutral field the Broncos are 1.5 points better. I think that's fair.
This is only because the Broncos are starting their back-up QB. Most people see that news and expect a poor performance, but the reality is up to this point in the season, the Broncos have had literally the worst QB in the league and they're still 7-2. Brock will definitely be an improvement for the team, although it seems weird to say that about PFM. 
Watch us get torched by Brock. 
I know about "any given Sunday," and that the NFL changes year to year, but this has possibly been the most unpredictable NFL season I've ever witnessed.
For those who don't know, typically Vegas gives 3 points to the home team, so this line is saying the Broncos are 1.5 points better than the Bears.
THIS SEASON IS FUCKING NUTS AND I HOPE THE BUURRS WIN AND THEN GO ON TO DESTROY THE SUPERB OWL.
New quarterbacks are always hard to predict
Reading one point five point was really weird in my head. Like a second decimal point.
14-13 Bears over Broncos. Defensive td and special teams td
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING TO THIS SEASON?!?
I read that as 15 points, my brain literally boggled 
What? So they lose one game and now the Broncos are no longer considered good? What gives?
It's never a good sign when lines swing this much. 
Had you told me this 4 weeks into the season i would have laughed in your face
Bears over Broncos and Dolphins Cowboys are even despite Romo's return. May be a great week to hit the casino. 
http://i.imgur.com/SKOb7UF.gif
Would have been pretty **bold** for someone to **predict** this at the start of the season.
Thank you for lowering my expectations. 
Excellent. Love the underrating we're getting right now. Give me the +1.5 ASAP.
We all knew that Peyton would be done at some point.  Still feels crazy to actually be witnessing it firsthand.
What a time to be alive.
It doesn't matter who you play, it matters when you play them.
Black is white, night is day, cats and dogs living together.
I mean it's really not saying much. IIRC the standard "home team advantage" is 3 points by itself right?

I don't know if I agree with it (Bronco's get Talib back, and Osweiler can't be worse than Manning's been), but 1.5 isn't really anything headline worthy imo.
Both Bears coordinators Gase and Fangio could find themselves head coaches in the NFL next year?  At least their coordinators are first rate.
I hate the Bears more than most things in life, but I will be not sad if they destroy Denver after the leaks coming out from that organization this week.  Peyton deserves better.
Fuck, it's a crazy world to think that The Bears are the Favorites against the Broncos.
This is a ridiculous spread. When did that Denver D stop becoming historically great? Free money. Can't wait.
http://e.lvme.me/swtmvsx.jpg
Good. We like being underdogs.
Fuck! i got it at 1!
AW HELLLLL NAW
Is this a joke? If I had a convenient way to game I would put an absolute TONNE of money on the Broncos.
This year might be one of the most wonky ones I've seen in awhile.. Good is bad, bad is good, everybody's hurt, two top teams go undefeated only to crash hard. 
I don't want to live in this world anymore. 
Oh fuck off
