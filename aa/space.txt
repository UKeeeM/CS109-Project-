Me, near the end of the gif:

"Hey, there's the big blob that will probably turn into a moon."  
\*blob gets pulled apart by gravity and turns into a piece of spaghetti\*  
"Oh, nevermind."
I think this is the simulation of the early earth gettting hit by the mars sized planet. Its the most accepted theory to where the moon came from.

edit: yep it is, here is a short video about it if you want to know more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibV4MdN5wo0
After careful analysis I have determined we would not survive such a scenario.
Any idea how long this simulation, theoretically, took to play out?

EDIT: I've found a public research paper on the topic at [researchgate](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/232280421_Forming_a_Moon_with_an_Earth-Like_Composition_via_a_Giant_Impact)
My first few thoughts upon seeing this,

1. We'd die.
2. Ohh we'd die real bad.
Stunning.  Is there a simulator where you can alter variables such as size, mass etc?  Something on the simulation to show the passing of time would add to it too.
So out of curiosity, why doesn't the Earth have a ring of debris today?
What would be happening on the surface of our planet if this were to occur? Would the other side of earth feel massive earthquakes or slight shudders? And how quick would it really happen? Would we be able to look at the sky and see a massive object hurtling towards us, or would we have seen it months/years in advance?
Would planets actually interact like this? The smaller ones just melt when they get near the large mass and start merging with them.
I was expecting to get let down by the gif ending too soon but I'm glad I wasn't!
Is this what happened with Saturn?
At what speed would all this take place? Over what kind of time frame?

Without hit by the mars sized planet would earth have enough mass to have magnetic field? I was wondering this since Mars was too small have it and thats why it lost its water? Sorry for my English and thank you for reading.
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/LRSmtYLVU90?t=7m) stunning scene from Melancholia.

Not only do you blow up half my home, you then process to cover the rest of it in searing hot lava. What a dick 
I will feel really sad about whoever staying on the last standing blue spot. The shock must be enough to mince them all into soup but some may survive around 1 more minute... experiencing the cosmic horror as he/she witness the end of the world.
Why doesn't the earth have rings?  All of the outer larger planets do.
Our universe is so big this is probably happening 1000x every second, somewhere ?
If this happened today do those living on the opposite side of the impact die instantly as well?
[When two planets actually collide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsV500W4BHU)
I'm pretty sure I could survive that with some canned food and a gun. Now I just need a pickup truck, a dog, a guitar, some beer, and a girl in daisy dukes. 
Someone should make a sci-fi movie where this happens to earth. Seeing this in advanced CGI would be awesome. The plot could be some heroic effort to build an "ark" to save humanity and send us off to some other habitable world.
"So, the scariest environment imaginable. Thanks.  That's all you got to say.  The scariest environment imaginable."
Very cool. How long would that whole process take?
Wondered if there is a game or something like this?
Initially I thought: "Oh, that wasn't so bad... oh shit."  Well, at least you got some nice moons and a ring system out of it.
This is fantastic. I thought I was in /r/simulations for a moment. Great stuff!! 
Do the warmer colours represent higher temperatures?  
If the planets collided, would the "end planet" be engulfed in the liquid warm core of one (or both) of the planets?
Anyone have a simulation of moon formation after the collision of earth and theia?
Is there a place to run simulations like this for myself?
And now the planets with rings and multiple moons make sense to me!! 

The more you know!!!
This is quite possibly the coolest video I have ever seen on Reddit 
Anyone know what the magnitude of such an earthquake would be on the Richter scale?
Crazy simulation. What kind of timeline does this simulation happen over? Hundreds, thousands of years?
I apologize if someone has already asked this question; but are there any theories out there that talk about what Earth would have been like if the collision did not happen? Is there life on Earth now because of the collision? 
So I'm thinking there might be some gravitational forces at play there.
So basically, in less than two days the earth would become a world of lava?
Does this simulation include the physics of both bodies rotating around a star or does this happen in a totally free vacuum state?
What is the time frame on this? How long would this 40 sec simulation be in real-time?
I would like to think that during the short time between the formation of the earth and the formation of the moon - life had formed. Maybe one day we'll find an artifact deep within the earth of some previous evolution. A crude depiction of some unimaginable life form.  Maybe that object will show that not only is life itself inevitable, but so are garden gnomes. 
Loved it - But it doesn't appear to accurately simulate planetary collisions especially given the simulation appears to more closely resemble tiny drops of liquid rather than two larger solid objects.

This is particularly evident later as the 'moon' peels off and enters the new main planet.  Can this simulation be redone with stronger bonding between the smaller particulars to better simulate a solid object?

Not complaining - just interested.
There is still a green spot towards the end.. 


Is this kind event livable to ANYTHING in that zone?
I wish that would happen today with Earth.  Preferably in the middle of the night as I am asleep.
What is the timeframe of this gif?
basically, from the beginning of the gif until the end, how much "time" has passed on the representation ?
I was so sure the bigger one would just absorb it and keep on chugging along. Evidently I need to stop playing that game. :/
I wanna see a simulation like this, but it's earth and theia and the moon is formed out of the collision
Maybe it's just me, but is it possible for rings (like those of Saturn) to form this way?
So since this is the most popular theory for where the moon came from, it's possible that all life that lived on Earth at the time of the collision is now buried hundreds of miles beneath the surface?

Hey /u/Isai76,


This is now the top post on reddit. It will be recorded at /r/topofreddit with all the other top posts.
Real dumb question: is this how planets get rings?
Could anyone fill me in on what the different colours indicate?
What does the color of voxels/particles represent here?
So, is this how the rings happen in planets like Saturn?
I'm curious to see a much smaller planet crash into that same sized planet. 
Reminds me of playing the powder toy back in the day with radial gravity on.  
We were shown his simulation this semester as a model for how the moon was created. As one of the current theories is that a mass about the size of Mars hit the Earth 4.5 billion ago, starting the Earth's rotation and creating the orbiting matter which later coalesced into the moon.
Kind of looks like this could give way to Saturns rings (from my ignorant point of view) any credibility to that possibility? 

If not how were Saturns' rings formed?
Most gas giants have rings, it's just a matter of how dense they are often thought to be a torn up moonlet.
Would we be dead before we could witness any of the cataclysmic immensity?
Would all the ejected material return that quickly in real time?
What would just the impact moment look like in real time?  I know this is sped up to give us all a better perception 
Is there anyway to tell if this has happened by studying our planet? Is there geological evidence left behind from this? 
I am not sure I understand it correctly. There are 2 objects colliding, one slightly bigger than the other. Why would the smaller disintegrate completely? What if both are gaseous? This simulation looks as if it has been made to visualize a theory as against a model to predict a collision between two celetial objects.
This really confused me because I wrongly read "two __planes__ colliding". haha :)
Would this be considered a mass extinction event?
Wow, that's so cool. Shouldn't the bigger planet have broken up though? It seemed to still stay in shape due to gravity but I thought that after being broken up into smaller fragments, the pieces would just float away.
Now show it to me in first person view.

Come on internet! You can do it!
What's the source for this?

Or in other words: is this legitimate astronomy/physics or is this just a pretty video with barely any basis in reality?
This is the asteroid that hit earth and formed the moon, not 2 planets colliding. 
So... if this is how Earth got it's moon, it's not too silly to assume that Earth was hit by a planet that already contained life? That's how life got here to Earth maybe... ?

It looks amazing seeing the tidal forces splitting apart some of the larger objects.
If we agree that the moon was required for life to begin on Earth, this would make our planet much more rare than just the being in the "Goldilocks" zone.
Beautiful, would be amazing if we could get the source code to see which variable used and how interact each other, how defined each planet's system, etc
Is this where rings around planets potentially come from, or is that another source?
How about if a Jupiter size planet hits a small size planet like Venus or Mars directly? Would it be similar to this or would it be similar to an asteroid hit?
One has to think that didn't go well for the residents of, well, either planet to be fair. 
very cool, just imagine how intense the meteor showers would be to see! on a more serious note, how did the atmosphere stay in place with all this?
So here are my questions about this. 
1. How long would it take in real time for something like that to end the way it did?
2. With it form like that because of the gravity of the planet, is that why Saturn has its rings in that very similar formation?
What do the colors indicate? The particles close to the "surface" of the larger planet are mostly red. What does this mean?
[deleted]
Is this why Saturn is the way it is? Big but very low density with a ring around it.
I like how at this scale, the planets are basically liquids.
This is amazing. Any info on the color code used?
After watching Melancholia, I am terrified of this scenario.

I mean we have no defense against it. It would just happen. But I think what freaks me out the most is that when everyone is gone and the Earth is destroyed...there will be no one left that remembers anything about our world. Just silence and space. 
This is absolutely terrifying. If a planet was about to hit Earth, there's nothing you can do. No matter where you stand, no matter where you go, you can't survive it. You'd have to leave Earth to survive that impact.

This is wierd, I learned about this in school today. 

Teacher said "This is the hottest the earth have ever been, and probably ever will be." Kinda neato if you ask me!
Doesn't look like there's enough (if any) of the blue area for all of us to survive :(
If that happened to earth I wouldn't have to pay my bills next month.
Watching this on loop at 400% zoom so that it fills my whole screen.

Good way to start the day.
Does this have anything to do with how saturn has its rings? 
What do they do if it DOES get stuck? Just kind of go "Shit." and make it become a stationary research station?
Stumbled upon this going through the [NASA](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08530) database!

&gt; This animated piece illustrates the recent escape of NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity from dangerous, loose material. Fortunately, Opportunity weathered its "Jammerbugt" and is again on its way toward Victoria Crater.

This is so cool. I wish we'd see more stuff like this - the minute details of the interactions of our technology with the Martian environment. 
Another world, a soil that was never touched by human hands directly.
The fact that these videos come from another planet still blows my mind... how far we have come.

*Sorry I just had to let that out*
That video is sped up quite a bit I think... they didn't just gun the engines and hope for the best, right?
How mad would the great men and women at NASA be if it got stuck like Spirit did? If I was in their position, I'd be absolutely furious, and some non-essential clipboards would get snapped in half

Whoa, look how much of the tread was filled with silt or sand. Or whatever we call it on Mars.
What is the NASA version of "just floor it and see what happens"?  Probably something like, "Applying maximum voltage may displace the loose substrate, exposing a layer with better traction."
It's easy to personify these rovers. They're an extension of us really.

I don't know why, but I find it really sad that Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity will never see one another.
Good thing it didn't get stuck. The tow charges to get it unstuck would have been astronomical.
I cant believe this thing is still kicking. Absolutely amazing. 
Watching this is so nerve-racking. All of that time and energy and money into a project, and SOIL nearly stops it from completing the task. 

I guess someone at NASA scienced the shit out of it and got it unstuck...
I love this. I wish there was more video being taken on Mars.  I know it's entirely impractical and would eat up precious bandwidth to send video, but if all they did was record Curiosity while it does its thing, I would watch every hour of it. 
Does anybody remember the toy from the 80s called The Animal?

https://youtu.be/5W4MYJt8c4w

 Why aren't they employing something like that to prevent getting stuck? 
Whew! That feeling is so good when your tire is spinning and stuck then all the sudden it grabs and you can move again. 
Went to wikipedia to scratch an itch. Opportunity is Rover-B or MER-1. Spirit is Rover-A or MER-2. Strange.
I don't know what is more interesting, the fact that mankind is pushing towards exploring other places in this vast universe and I'm able to see the exploration from my office or that I'm fascinated and excited to see these pictures of a device made from our creative mind with our own hands, get stuck in the dirt and emerge.  Exciting times we live in, and thanks for posting! 

Edit:  that was my best excited run-on sentence....:) 
I'm surprised they don't give the rovers a little more tread. I understand weight watching and partial gravity but still with all that soft sand I feel like it would be warranted

Edit: wasn't trying to say I'm smarter than jpl or anything haha just a thought. Thanks for anyone who explained a little
I think both opportunity and spirit's mission was tabbed to last for 90 sols - or 93ish earth days.  Opportunity is currently at 11 years and 194 days.  So we are talking about some serious bonus time...that little guy though...he keeps on ticking.
Lol at the folks saying terrible design etc.

Though this is for Curiosity it shows the amount of thought that goes into the design:

Take a look at this article: http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2014/08190630-curiosity-wheel-damage.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/

The wheels of martian rovers take a beating out there. That's the problem with limited transport capacity vs durability. I bet the team watching that footage all winced when they first saw the wheels trying to gain traction.
I can just imagine the time going by while trying to get out and the team back an NASA going: https://media.giphy.com/media/a79Jr229u3bzO/giphy.gif
Why don't they use a tire with more aggressive tred? Is it for efficiency?
What this picture doesn't convey is the size of the wheels.  They are about 50cm in diameter, so about 20-25cm deep in Martian sand.  Nice.
I can't believe this thing's still going.  I can go 6 months without some tire deflating or some check engine light appearing.
In case anybody doesn't know the size, here's a comparison. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/PIA15279_3rovers-stand_D2011_1215_D521.jpg

Opportunity on the left, Curiosity/Spirit on the right, Sojourner on the bottom left. Two dudes in the middle.
Martian 1: Aw, it's stuck. Should we help it?

Martian 2: No, we're documentary filmmakers, we cannot interfere. And stay behind that rock!
This will probably never be read by anyone but I cannot help saying how AWESOME it is to be able to watch a GIF of a rover on Mars that has been there an EPIC amount of time much^2 longer than expected of it and just appreciate seeing the details of "dirt" on a planet other than Earth. just wow.
Opportunity's still running after what, 11 years?  Just incredible.  The engineer that designed that rover seriously deserves an award.  
I once had an opportunity to get stuck in Victoria's crater but she managed to escape...
Just to clarify: Opportunity is not currently stuck or at risk of getting stuck. These pictures are from 2006. Here's a color view from after Opportunity backed out of the ripple:
http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/images/mer20060720.html
When I stop and think about it, it's pretty special some angry apes from a different planet managed to construct and send a machine to a distant planet, and then watch through it's eyes as it works.

Man, IFLS.
To be fair, what you don't see in that gif is the other 5 wheels turning, presumably with more traction.  And obviously, that's why the smart people of NASA made it 6 wheel drive. Those wheels are also huge, wide, and self cleaning.  A really cool design.  http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/images_blogs/wiredscience/2012/08/curiosity_wheel_pattern_morse_code.png
Is Opportunity taking Google Streetview pics of Mars? Cause that would be pretty fun to look through.
Why don't we see more footage from Mars? To me this is way more interesting than still pictures. It feels like "holy shit" we have robots walks all over Mars. 
Jacked up ~~Chevy~~ rover tryin' get a little higher, 
It just had to put a little ~~mud~~ Martian soil on its tires. 
Can i ask what happens if it gets stuck? Also how long is its battery life? Does it recharge? 
Look at the treads on that thing.  Not much too them but the guys at NASA must have a reason.
Do the rovers have ways to clean off their own wheels? That dirt really looks caked on there
Serious Question. Are those tyres the best for that type of terrain? It looks like it can't grip onto any surface.
They wouldn't have so many darn potholes on Mars if those Martians would just pay a little more tax for infrastructure!
Guys, we're watching video, from the surface of another planet. IS THIS REAL LIFE?!?
Could you imagine the conversation to call a tow truck?

- [Curi] Hey, I need a tow. 
+ [tow] OK, where are you?

- [Curi] Somewhere on Mars. 
+ [tow] No problem.  We'll be there in about 20 to 40 years.  Earth time. 
They need some sort of propulsion system to blast these things out of ruts and stuff if they get stuck! Or put tiny little adorable chains on the tires.
Can we take a moment to talk about how freaking awesome this is?

I'm viewing a gif on my phone. From a robot. On MARS. 

From freaking MARS!
After watching the Martian I feel I am fully duly qualified to say "that's probably dirt, not soil"
Pfft, that's nothing.  The China rabbit is still functional.  On the moon!
How tense was this rover operator? Like his name would go down in infamy in the office for getting the rover stuck in some dry mud... I'd be sweating bullets and if I did get it stuck I would turn in my two weeks.

I am sure the person who got Spirit stuck isn't with NASA anymore... Just saying.

Seems like if this was Martian technology it would just be hoovering over the ground.
I could almost feel a room full of people at NASA sweating bullets when I saw this.
I was rooting for it like the little erector set Rover the kid built in the Sandlot 
Could you imagine what would happen if it was stuck? "We're funding a mission to Mars so somebody can poke Opportunity with a stick to get it unstuck"

If it gets permanently stuck. It's not a loss since they can still leave it there for Matt Damon to use.
Why didn't they out bigger tread on the tires? We knew it was very sandy there. 

https://www.google.com/search?q=sand+tires
All i could think about was this guy.

http://www.fiz-x.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/tv-the-big-bang-theory09.jpg
I'm sure NASA spent thousands of expensive engineering man-hours deciding on that tread pattern, but it sucks.
Have you ever seen millions of dollars almost become that obsolete?
Still blows my mind there is a nuclear powered robot the size of a small SUV exploring Mars.
Am I the only one that thinks those wheels have a terrible traction design? The treads seem so shallow to me.  I have to assume all those scientists noodled this quite a bit before deciding on those particular wheels......  but even cheap remote controlled toys have more traction on their treads.
If you're reading The Martian or have not seeing the movie stop reading the comments now.  People are making references  to the movie and book and saying spoilers with out warnings.  You've been warned. 
The dude driving that was most likely freaking the hell out and spamming different buttons trying to fix it.

Kind of like when you haven't saved your game progress in forever, and the system freezes.
Is this shit from mars? How many cameras does opportunity got? And what communications technology does it use, to be able to send this to earth so quickly?
If 'Opportunity' and 'Spirit' have been on Mars since 2004, approximately 11 years Earth time. How long have they been on Mars in Mars time? Does time not move differently on Mars like in the movie Interstellar?
of course they ran a lot of tests with previous designs of the rover wheels to make sure it wotn get stuck on a hill of sand that easily.
My heart almost stopped, I'm glad it got out.. It is just amazing! I love it all, I can't wait for more information
Do they have the capability to push the rover with the boom?
it's ok. Space Damon would just tether it out. no need to worry, NASA.
How are they actually driving this thing? Is it automated? Will it just keep rolling the engines if it actually does get stuck?

Or do we need to wait a few weeks for a command to come from NASA to tell it to turn right or pick something up?
It has got to be stressful as hell to know your multibillion dollar, years of planning mission could go tits up over a couple inches of loose dirt. 
[Regolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith), not soil.
As an off-road enthusiast. No he didn't. You don't even start to think you might get stuck until you haven't made any forward progress for five minutes.

Aren't those rovers equipped with some kind of mechanism that can be used to free them in such situations ?
Reminded me of going to the Imperial Dunes. In my head I heard, bbbbrrraaattt bbbbrrraaattt. 
Can someone explain why  don't they use caterpillar design?
This is the stuff nightmares are made of. That gif had me cringing so hard.
I'm telling you, that damn thing has become self-aware.  We should kill it while we still have the chance.
Maybe they won't be so quick to dismiss my idea of putting mud tires and a cup holder on the next rover. 
What happens if it gets stuck, can it not just reverse?
Didn't this happen a few times or with another rover that just had to be abandoned?  

It looks as though it is in reverse in this gif. Notice the direction of the scoops in the tire tread. But now that I think about it maybe the tires on the other side of the vehicle have an opposing tread pattern, and are the ones that actually pushed it out of the soft soil.
How does it get stuck? Isnt the soil rock hard?
Go ~~Speed Racer~~ Opportunity,

Go ~~Speed Racer~~ Opportunity,

Go ~~Speed Racer~~ Opportunity, goooooooo!!!!
That video quality makes it look like the wheels are one step behind the technology used in Tonka Trucks
Where is Victoria Crater? I can't find any source that shows the location when looking at the whole planet
Does that mean the soil has a little bit of moisture?
That's nothing. Let me tell you about getting stuck in a Michigan snowbank.
Messing with my head - I can't get over the fact that I can see the wheel spinning forwards or backwards at will....
I don't think it would have gotten stuck, the tires are designed by engineers so that it doesn't happen, things have to be earth independent when we send them to mars.
So if it did get stuck, couldn't we just send the OpporTWOnity to go get it?
We should be sending rovers every year.  If this one dies I will die a little inside.  We need to know more about mars.  And then we should send one from Mars to Jupitor
They should really consider putting a grappling hook on that thing. Or an arm that it can push itself with. Maybe some tracks instead of wheels. [A backhoe. Like this](http://r3.forconstructionpros.com/files/base/image/FCP/2011/03/16x9/640x360/1cxtracked3_10244147.jpg)
why dont they go to the edge of that big ass canyon and take pictures, isnt it like 10 miles deep or some shit. sounds cool.
Hey Opportunity, what did you do on Monday?

 -- Tried to get out of a hole.

What did you do on Tuesday?

 -- Tried to get out of a hole.

And Wednesday?

 -- Still tried to get out of a hole.

Thursday?

 -- Hole.

Friday??

 -- Got out of the hole.
That is a beautiful clip, but what are we looking at and what is it being filmed from?
Holy shit, that debris that flies away when it separates.. Looks so fricking awesome. Great footage.
This was a Hollywood level shot. I'm sure someone with a film degree could explain why this was so beautiful right down to the angle and timing. It just feels directed. With a good ass cinematographer too. 
That's an absolutely amazing shot. For anyone wondering, the source says the rocket's payload reached a maximum altitude of 75 miles (120 km). Which makes this booster separation altitude probably somewhere close to the altitude Blue Origin achieved with their New Shepard vehicle last week.

[This song played in my head](https://gifsound.com/?gfycat=FriendlyClosedCod&amp;v=lkzWF1UE1CI&amp;s=100) as I rewatched this
Does anyone know how strong the explosion is that separates the two compartments? What would it be equal to?
By the end of the clip, the blackness of outer space is fisheye bent in such a way that it looks like a giant, obsidian planet. The ol' sobering celestial switcheroo.
~~I love the flash of light.  It's weird to watch light simply *flee* from it's source, completely unimpeded.~~  

~~Edit - Before anyone else follows this chain down and has a bone to pick:  I'm just saying that it's a pretty flash of light.  I wasn't trying to define the light, its properties, interactions, whatever.  It's a unique environment to view a pretty little explosion.~~

~~Is this the part where someone takes umbrage over the word "little" and has to describe the entire fucking separation process?  I get it.  You all know cool shit about space.~~

THERE IS NO LIGHT

ONLY DARKNESS

ONLY ZUUL

Edit - Aw!  Obligatory thanks and whatnot!
It's always so mesmerizing to me how things in space move with very low friction from air resistance, in this case, the way the four cables are behaving as the object they're attached to (with the camera on it) spins.  It's like watching math in action.  

To quote Spock, "Fascinating."   

Cheers!  
Wow, I now get where all the space debris comes from. Like, I understood that debris was inevitable, but to see so much junk explode from just that one separation, I get it now.
This is... way more beautiful than any other seperation I've seen. Thanks for this!
I frikkin love booster separations. This was so satisfying. Ahhhhh.
After 10 seconds into the gif, the earth's horizon looks concave. Why?
Ahh.. This is making me dizzy. Can anyone stabilize this so the image isn't rotating?
How the Earth's curvature changes is pretty amazing.
If you imagine the right cable as the top cable's shadow, then the top cable looks MASSIVE and seems to briefly brush up against the Earth.
Do we have footage like this from other launches?

I prefer to believe that capturing this footage was intentional, that a rocket scientist calculated the spin and timing of this separation, and then made sure that this camera would have the whole thing in frame.
After watching 10 seconds into the gif, the earth's horizon appears concave....
Am I the only one who feels like a floating tentacle space creature when watching this?

A gif so good you can almost hear the explosion and the separation.
Just wondering, is it normal for there to be so much debris to be ejected when the booster separates?
Hollywood has ruined me... This just looks CGI to me... I know it's not, but dam it... If I ever go to space I hope I don't think it's fake!
So cool to watch this, I was on the Purdue team that put our payload together. Great experience as a student

Guys, there are people in space! I mean literal human beings, right now, are in space!

Does anyone else just randomly freak out/marvel about this? By the looks on people's faces when I do it would seem not.

I always wished I lived in the future, then sometime in the last year or two I looked around and realised I was!

Pardon my ignorance but I am genuinely interested.  

At what point in time are objects no longer measured in altitude, but measured in velocity?

Surely it makes sense for something designed for escape velocity, perhaps even an object that is in an elliptical orbit, to be more aptly described as having a velocity, opposed to an altitude.  

Thanks in advance.
Just wondering, is it normal for there to be so much debris to be ejected when the booster separates?
Absolutely stunning view up there. I can't help but feel a surge of adrenaline watching humanity on the outer edge of the planet, using science to achieve amazing things.
I thought from the title that Union Pacific Railroad company started a space program and it actually made a lot of sense to me 
Is that the moon i'm seeing? What are those objects at the tip of the rocket?
The shape and color of the equator of the craft before ejecting happened.
Everybody who doesn't experience motion sickness needs to use their intoxicant of choice right now and then rewatch this gif. The rotation and unique content make this supremely entertaining if you're already a little disoriented. 
There are formulas to convert those 6 Keplerian Elements eccentricity semi-major axis inclination longitude of the light are appealing.
Quick, somebody figure out the relative masses!
That almost gave me vertigo. I am not sure if i would make it in space. 
Where is that on the earth? Like below this, what are we looking at?
This is possibly the most interesting gif ive ever seen
You see that booster firing itself at that Alien ship?  NASA just confirmed other worldly life.
Awesome! I wish I could try to get into the space industry somehow.
Clips like these always give me a bit of thrill.  Even with all our calculations and timing and specifically designed equipment making stuff like this function on a very systematized level, there is still a thrill in the concept of lunging things into the dark vastness of space.  The thought of gripping onto gravity as the one major and trustworthy force out there.
I don't know if /r/spaceporn exists, but I think this is the epitome of it.
I believe the fisheye lens is so amazing like holy shit we are in the morning.
Why, at the end, does it look like the earth is curving the opposite way?
Watching that burst of separation, I'm amazed how carefully these things have to be planned. One too many ft/lbs, it all goes irreversibly wrong.

"The terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile, but that it is indifferent."

Stanley Kubrick.
Amazing shot, took me a minute to realize it was a full sized rocket. Model rockets, small ones, both look like that AND have a similar method for deploying their nose cone. Although, for a model rocket, it's just dragging out the chute, not launching a payload.
Those small shrapnel if they were to hit me what damage could it cause? 
perfectly captured motion sickness.
    
but super bad ass.
What are those objects at orbital velocities are described using 6 Keplerian elements back to the angle and timing.
Thank you so much for posting this beautiful and inspiring video.
So beautiful... It reminds me of when Wing Zero Custom first took flight.

I hadn't figured rope would be one of the materials used in constructing rockets, or is it just frayed cables that look like rope?
So mesmerizing. It's interesting how objects move when they're in orbit
Can anyone explain what that debris is from the separation? I mean I think it's water turned to ice but I'd hate to think it's trash floating in space forever.
Given that the lower section should be empty of fuel and *much* lighter, shouldnt conservation of momentum dictate that the upper section should be ejected slowly while the lower speeds off downward?
I can't help but hear the last piece going "peace oooouuuu^u^u^u^u^u^t
Related thought I've had recently and wondering if someone here can answer, what happens to the booster/fuel tanks after separation? Does it just become part of the giant space debris shield thing we got going on up there? And how do space agencies predict where the debris is so it doesn't hit launching vehicles?
what is all the debris that comes from the separation?
If you like this kind of stuff, then Kerbal Space Program is the game for you!
As a geologist, my first thought was, "ooooohhhh, that looks like the San Andres range of New Mexico!"....google search.....Launched from White Sands....ahhh. yep!

Very surreal video.  Love it.
Your move Bezos.
Need some pointer on the background music. Who is the artist?
Based on just the clip shown, I like to think I'm a giant space octopus
That is awesome I wodnder if he got the free chesty strap with his GoPro ?
Looks just like a computer simulation.  Perfect.
Is that rope? Rope doesn't strike me as a material that would be used in Aerospace designs.
Really makes me think of the [Sabre Launch in Halo: Reach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYcCuU4lrVw).  I feel like they got it mostly right.
NASA used to put motion film cameras between stages and then made sure that this camera would have thought it would be r/reallifedoodles/ Yeah its beautiful but I am genuinely interested.
Just wondering, is it normal for there to be so much debris to be ejected when the booster separates?
They'll probably be able to use that footage as marketing material when trying to pick an argument with someone who was just waxing poetic about a pretty goddamned light.
why doesn't the bottom half move? shouldn't the explosion that separated the two parts push both pieces of the rocket away?
Several layers of parallax - the beautiful camera pan, the rocket slowly spinning.
I don't know exactly what it is, maybe its the music I'm listening to as I watched this, but that is the most badass thing I've seen in awhile.
What chunk of land is below? Looked like a glacier or snowy mountain top near an ocean. Maybe East Africa?
Breathtaking. I watched the video someone linked further down and had goosebumps - the video's clarity and the timing to capture it like this is fantastic.
Wow, that's beautiful.  Is this a real shot?  Seems too good to be true.
Great shot! But the Orbital Debris problem was my graduating Thesis, this makes me cringe...
Someday we're gonna get the shit fined out of us by some crazy Alien Federation for littering space. 
Like, I understood that debris that flies away when it separates..
And there are still people that believe we haven't gone to space ffs
This looks like something straight out of interstellar, martian or gravity
The separation of rocket boosters always makes me uneasy; isn't there a huge danger of them falling to Earth and causing harm?
ya know I think a lot of people (like me) find separation to be a rather passive term.  Where this shows nicely it's actually an explosion.  Just an interesting thought how calculated a separation has to be.
Am I the only one that has always wanted to see how many G forces I could take before passing out? I used to love the old UFO ride at the fair! (Yes I know that's like an ant compared to the real thing)
Wait, but the way the cracks are positioned indicate the person broke the wall through the other side. 
Is this the one at Goddard?

Also, the centrifuge was probably one of the funnest things I've gotten to do in my life... well until the G measles and pain from the blood pooling/burst capillaries set in a few hours later

edit: to clarify, I did not do the centrifuge there, but out at the one in San Antonio. It was great seeing a bunch of autographed NASA pictures as they use that one too for training
I need to stop drinking and Redditing....I read that as "NASA's human centipede room". Sigh.
You mean on the *outside* of the wall to the centrifuge room, right?
Does anybody else really really really want to get spun around in one of those?
Whoa that's so cool! Do you work in the centrifuge?
Did this remind anyone else of Robert Gober's artwork?
wait a sec... why is that person's legs outside the room... 
did the centrifuge push him off or something!!! 
i just want to know, what are human centrifuged for? won't his insides all come out?
Or *outside* the centrifuge room? The guy couldn't have gone through the wall and left TWO holes.. 
However, if I'm lying down, with my head pointing towards the center of gravity would still be in the wall and left TWO holes..
I love the fact that someone went to the trouble to make this, and then the administration had enough of a sense of humor to allow it to stay up.
Wait, but the way the cracks are positioned indicate the person broke the wall through the other side. 
I was under the impression they used the metric system instead of measuring in feet.
Title is wrong IMO... It should say "Saw this at a room next to the NASA's human centrifuge room"
Isn't anybody else bothered by the fact that it seems more like he popped from the other side rather than being flung from the side the camera is? I mean where is the torso hole??
Never been more entertained in /r/space Its really more of a dead giveaway too Maybe he was a really pathetic attempt to be funny...I am very ashamed of myself.
Even though this probably might not be the right subreddit I was just wondering I have a dream of sorts to work aboard the ISS. Anyone here in reddit have any experience with Canada and it's space programs or any sort of advice of what I should study in college to be someone aboard the ISS? I'm 15 right now and while I am taking advanced math and just physics I don't really know that much about what I should study or do to accomplish this dream. If anyone can give me any advice thank you
wait a sec... why is that person's legs outside the room... 
did the centrifuge push him off or something!!! 
Sure is a beauty, isn't she? Statue of Liberty. First time seeing it? Oh, you just came over? Well, have I a deal for you. For a small price, you can own that statue. https://youtu.be/9LCNrIsHfl0 I happen to have the title for it right here..... 
However, if I'm lying down, such that my legs point toward the center, the blood only has one leg to try new equipment and to do in my life... well until the G measles and pain from the side the camera is?
Apparently, that was a force to be reckoned with...
Going in a centrifuge is on my bucket list. Along with becoming an astronaut and going to outer space.  
wait a sec... why is that person's legs outside the room... 
did the centrifuge push him off or something!!! 
Read this as NASA's human centipede room. And I was like: "Well, they definitely got some NIH funding!"
Misread that as "human centipede room". (I'd bet more people did the same)
Well, hopefully not the last. We'll get there again one day, won't we? :(

You are forgetting to [mention the best video that was ever shot](https://youtu.be/Dr98RgNjAgg?t=27s), the assent of the LEM back to the Command Module on Apollo 17.  The camera operator in Huston had to zoom back and pan the camera upwards two seconds **before** the LEM blasted off from the moon, due to the time that it takes the radio signal to reach the moon. There are no third takes with this shot.  They attempted it before with Apollo 16 but timed it wrong. 
Technically this video are  the last photos taken while humans were on the moon. 
 
Why does the ground in the last photo seem much smoother than in the first?

Edit: Thanks for all your answers! I would give you all gold, but I won't give any of you gold.
I took the liberty of creating a high quality version:

http://imgur.com/4mKGxh0
Let's say first and "most recent" photos taken by humans on the Moon.  We all better hope they're not the last.
Good to see that since we have arrived on the moon, we have built adequate grain storage pyramids.
Question about the moon- would being on the surface resemble being on earth in regards to its roundness? For example, if you run on wrath, you wouldn't even now you're technically running in a "circle". You just keep running what seems like straight to you, but in reality you're going around the globe.

Is the moon small enough for you to be able to see the horizon over your field of vision? If not, what would running on one of those tiny planets like that seem like?
Is the first picture a better quality, or is the environment totally different?
Every time I remember that we landed on the moon it absolutely blows my mind. I can't believe how far we've come as a species. In roughly 60 years we went from learning to fly to landing on a foreign body ~~millions of miles away~~. It makes me proud to be a part of humankind. 
It reminds of when you look out your window at 3AM to see the snowfall vs. 3PM after people went around and mucked up the place.

For anyone curious

http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-announces-first-manned-mission-to-moon-2015-10
My  son, a First Year Engineering student at Purdue,  would point out that the first human on the moon (Neil Armstrong) and the last human on the moon (Gene Cernan) both received their undergraduate Engineering degrees from Purdue. 
The pic on the right looks like an N64 game, and the left pic looks like it's 2015 remake.
I still can't understand the obsession with Mars.  We shouldn't think about anything else until we have the moon colonized to the point that we can manufacture things there in micro gravity.

Apparently a space elevator would also be feasible on the moon...that would be massively useful.
Quick question... why are there no stars in the sky?
I'm sure someone has already asked, but where can I get the raw scans of the moon photos taken with the hasselblads?
In the first photo,the metal cone looks like a bowl to a shitty acrylic bong that would have been used primarily in the 90s.Astronauts are so meta
this has caused me to ask a question I had never before considered. how is a spaceship able to stay planted on something like the moon? wouldn't gravity cause it to hover at the least and float away at the most? maybe a dumb question, but I'm not super smart and would love to find out how this happens.
Alternatively, I'd like to see "The First and Last Photos Taken by Non-Humans on the Moon."
looks like we built mountains out of crater holes...  Good Job guys!  Lets go home!
That looks like a jigger in the first photo. They were about to make cocktails 
Is there any where online to download every picture on the moon ?

Imagine driving around on the fucking moon... not many stories can beat that at the pub!
"why can't I see any stars?"
"because it's daytime."
Why can't you see the stars in the pictures?  Is there something close to the moon's surface which would obscure the stars, or is it simply a camera effect?
Amazing how different they look. One looks like a hard rocky surface. Thd othe almost like a fine sand.
Won't be the last, there will be plenty of photo ops when the Moon becomes a theme park 
Why does the first one look a million times better than the last one?
Fun fact: There are no stars in the sky because it is daytime and the sky is black because there is no atmosphere to scatter the light.
Why does the ground like that seem like? http://i.imgur.com/3bO2gyh.jpg This might show some perspective.
I'm guessing the picture on the left is the last and the one on the right is the first?

The title suggests otherwise.
Isn't it amazing that in 1969 we got a clear broadcast from the moon and apollo 11 right to American TV sets, (you know the old 13 turn dial bunny ear tv's) and yet over 2 decades later during Desert Storm we struggled broadcasting footage from a middle eastern desert.

That's really something isn't it? That's kinda odd huh?


Did you know traveling to and from the moon is like 234,00 miles... But our astronauts these days and their shuttle's operate from 200 to 400 miles up. 

It's really interesting. 

We haven't been back to the moon in over 4 decades to.

That's interesting to. 

It's very interesting.
[deleted]
If we ever do go back to the Moon, then we probably don't need the missions to be manned, right?
The comparison really shows how technology in photography has come along.
Woah. We left some mountains behind. We need to [bring them home](http://i.imgur.com/zLHM9h4.jpg).
Not to seem crazy, but why does the moon look like it has more color in it when viewing it from Earth with a good telescope?  Is it a trick of the eye, the atmosphere? In every photo taken by the astronauts, it seems dim, grayish, and rather lifeless.
We landed on the moon!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-f_DPrSEOEo
What are those plus-signs on the right picture for?
So interesting. I feel like I can drive to the horizon pretty quickly.
As I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come (but we believe not too long into the future), I'd like to just say what I believe history will record: That America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return: with peace and hope for all mankind. - Gene Cernan
At what rate does shit hit the moon to create all of the indentations
What's up with that flat triangle mountain? Do we have a full picture of that somewhere?
Take only pictures, leave only footprints.

And a few million dollars of 1970's tech.
Of you ain't the first to take a picture of the moon you're the last!
I feel like a dumb dumb asking this.. but why can we not see any stars in these pictures?
Can someone explain why there are no stars visible in the sky? 
Love the reaction control thruster photobomb.  Cool comparison!
Looks like they did a pretty good job paving.  Only a few potholes in the last one.
It's been 50 years and we've done noting with the moon. Can't we at least use it for dumping our garbage?
Why are there no stars in the sky in pictures taken on the moon? 
Why are there never any stars on moon pictures?
might be a silly question but: Why cant we see any stars? Wouldnt the lack of atmosphere greatly intensify visibility?

Also, i dont know how im only just learning that we've been to the moon 6 times, interesting!
The newer pic has a small black dot in the sky. What's that? 
Funny how there are no stars in the background.
I'm looking at the tracks in the second pic, and it looks like someone took their driving test up there. *I'm gonna start by heading over here, hang a left, three-point turn, go back the other way, parallel park, get out and walk around a little bit, annnnnnd I'm done. Better head back ~~home~~ to the tin can I'm living in while I'm here.*
What's kinda fucked up is how much Neil's first words overshadow Buzz's. The dude stepped out less than 20 minutes after him, but "One small step for man" is the only one you hear about.

("Beautiful view," btw)
first pic looks like someones about pack a bowl on the moon. Gettin high indeed
High resolution: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/PIA15279_3rovers-stand_D2011_1215_D521.jpg

Wikipedia caption "Two Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers stand with three vehicles, providing a size comparison of three generations of Mars rovers. Front and center is the flight spare for the first Mars rover, Sojourner, which landed on Mars in 1997 as part of the Mars Pathfinder Project. On the left is a Mars Exploration Rover (MER) test vehicle that is a working sibling to Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in 2004. On the right is a test rover for the Mars Science Laboratory, which landed Curiosity on Mars in 2012. Sojourner is 65 cm (2.13 ft) long. The Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) are 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long. Curiosity on the right is 3 m (9.8 ft) long."
Curiosity is almost as big as a car. And I think Mars 2020 is going to be same in size..
I'm surprised nobody's done a movie about a rover from another planet arriving on Earth.  It could land in times square or something.
Its interesting to note that the largest one (Curisoity) doesn't have solar panels; it is internally powered by a [radioisotope-thermoelectric generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator) or [RTG](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Cutdrawing_of_an_GPHS-RTG.jpg)
You know what's awesome? Some day, probably hundreds of years from now, these will sit in a museum on Mars, where planet tourists will visit and marvel at the ancient robotic technology used by us plebs. They might even leave them where they last stopped, and encase them in a little shed/room to protect them and people can drive around to view them.

My favorite part of that is that one of the little ones is basically an [unkillable monstrosity.](https://xkcd.com/1504/)
Here's [original picture](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15279) with a little bit more info.
One rover that is technically on Mars as well... [Prop-M from 1971.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_3#Prop-M_Rover)
I'd imagine any Martians living there would be terrified to see Curiosity. That thing is intimidating!
Imagine what NASA could do with decent funding.
I was never curious about the size of Curiosity, as I had assumed it was about the size of a german shepherd. Curiously, it is way fucking bigger than I ever imagined.
So this might get buried but I was a co-op at JPL for a few years and one time they had the rovers out like this and [let us all take pics with them!](https://i.imgur.com/mzT2p.jpg)
Here is a closer look at Curiosity http://i.imgur.com/yLXNxIz.jpg (at the Kennedy Space Center)
When we can give NASA websites the reddit hug of death, I'm reminded that there are still so many people that care. People who are curious, who dream of exploration beyond the limits of our bright blue sky, who stare into the stars at night and see each and every light as a future adventure, a future space launch, or even just a photograph.

Keep being awesome, people, because without our collective yearning for the stars, *we* might just go dark on *them*
I've seen this image before, but I'm still a little surprised whenever I see the size of the current rover. I still have the idea that they're all the size of RC cars stuck in my head.
The next one needs to be the size of a monster truck, with 8 wheels, and spider-like appendages.
Saw one of the rovers in action at Jet Propulsion Labs once. The scale is impressive, they also let us put various rocks/debris in the way and let the rover cruise over them. Crazy to think about them doing their thing on Mars.
I doubt this will get answered, but why the consistency with the six wheel design?

My assumption would be that it helps with uneven terrain, but I'd like to know for sure.
I just love everything about the rovers. The engineering is top notch. Opportunity^^^^(? ^^^^don't ^^^^know ^^^^if ^^^^it's ^^^^the ^^^^correct ^^^^one) originally designed for a 90 Sol mission (One sol is 24 hours and 37 minutes, so around 92 days(?)), is still waddling around on the oxide covered planet. This engineering from NASA and also the other space agencies that worked on it proves that humanity can achieve a lot of things together :)

I just CAN'T wait for the Mars 2020 rover! I mean, look what they did with all the other rovers and data they got from them. The Mars 2020 rover is going to be even better and more advanced. I also hope they will implement the tiny drone, that would just be amazing, and it will also be a first! Imagine what data we can get from it.

Mars is a planet in our solar system populated entirely by robots.
Wow, that one in the middle looks remarkably like a rock.

Are there plans to create another Rover?
Maybe it's more impressive to think about them doing their thing on Mars. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Mars The helicopter is a lightsaber handle.
Does anybody know why they don't put beefier, more "off-road" looking tires on the rovers?
What are the scientists doing on Mars without helmets that's dangerous
Woah, woah, woah, hold the phone!  How in the HELL did those two guys get to Mars to pose with the rovers?!  I thought we were YEARS from having people make that trip, and those guys are up there posing for pictures?
If you look closely you can see two rocks shaped oddly like human males. Aliens?
I want to know how big the Viking landers are compared to these.
Why can't a flying drone that will work on Mars be developed? Terrain wouldn't be an issue right?
They seem to be posed on a sort of simulated Martian surface - does anyone have more info about this?
It amazes me how much science and money was needed to just put an sun powered relatively toy sized RC CAR on a piece of floating red rock a few million killometers going up from the ground my bed that I'm currently laid down required.
Seeing this picture made me go hunting for a size-comparison of the Viking landers. Stumbled upon a picture of [Carl Sagan standing next to a scale model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e8/Sagan_Viking.jpg).
This was shot on the same sound stage as the moon landing, just in color this time.
Wow, that one in the middle looks remarkably like a rock.

Are there plans to create another Rover?
The scientists even went to Mars for the photoshoot!  Now that's dedication!
Good thing the scientists are wearing white lab coats so we can see they're scientists.
My first thought was: "Why are they standing on Mars without space suits!?!?  Scientists are dumb."
Those scientists are fucking dead. No way a man can survive on Mars without a spacesuit.
So, is this the Martian surface? Are these scientists photoshopped in? I'm confused as to the origin of this photo. 
So, which one of these sings to itself every birthday?
Correction: All the *NASA* rovers, other countries do sent rovers up as well.
Kinda sucks that not long ago I made this exact post here and only received 60 upvotes, but such is reddit
My uncle works for Ball that made parts for these rovers, had some interesting dinner conversation about space exploration for thanksgiving 
I wonder how large the Mars 2020 rover will be, relative to *Sojourner,* *Spirit/Opportunity,* and *Curiosity.*
I always forget how big Curiosity is. For some reason I always picture it being the size of a large dog, not a small car haha
Beta radiation is a NASA concept for future missions, but it wouldn't be a great idea.
The machine on the right is unbelievably badass! Holy shit that thing must have cost a fortune to build! 
Damn, *Curiosity* is a freaking tank. Never realized how big she is compared to everything else.
This produces a paltry amount of shielding required make the car too heavy to be examined or tested.
This might be tempted to use fissile material and get a chain reaction going.
Potentially stupid question, but how did they get a picture of all the rovers when they went up years apart?
Can someone explain how this picture exists? Shouldn't those rovers be on Mars or were they all built at the same time? Are they models?

Like if it's a small, lightweight platform with a little shed/room to protect them and people can drive around to view them.
Space mining is about to get real...

As long as we can get other countries to go along with it.
This bill is along the lines of the open louisiana prchase in the 1800s. "If you can get to it, it's yours."
Good luck to even the US enforcing anything in space outside of near orbit. Space pirates here we come!
I've lived long enough that "black president signs asteroid bill into law" isn't fiction.

It's a good time to be alive.
I sometimes fear humanity will end when some company or country 40 years from now tries to tow an asteroid into orbit and it crashes into earth instead.
I'm curious how this can be harmonized with the UN Outer Space Treaty. While articles 1 and 2 only forbid national appropriation, surely companies making claims to own property there would need the backing of a country (in this case, the US) for their claim to be meaningful in any way. 
Doesn't this violate the outer space treaty? Countries cannot own space, and its my understanding that a country has to own something to be able to give it to its citizens.
More importantly, H.R. 2262 also alters the Office of Commercial Space Transportation's regulations for non-government spacecraft.

Case in point:

"(Sec. 103) Certain time constraints of requirements for commercial space launch and reentry experimental permits are repealed. Rockets, reusable launch vehicles that will be launched into a suborbital trajectory, and designs for such vehicles as well as rocket designs are covered. DOT may issue an experimental launch or reentry permit notwithstanding the issuance of any launch or reentry license. Neither shall the issuance of such a license invalidate an experimental permit.

"DOT may issue an experimental permit for reusable suborbital rockets or reusable launch vehicles that will be launched into a suborbital trajectory or reentered solely for crew training regardless of whether the crew trains before or after obtaining a license.

"Experimental permits may also authorize an unlimited number of launches and reentries for a particular suborbital rocket or reusable launch vehicle or reusable launch vehicle design (currently, only for a suborbital rocket design).

"Prohibits any person from operating a reusable launch vehicle (as well as, currently, a reusable suborbital rocket) under an experimental permit for carrying any property or human being for compensation or hire."

TL;DR:  It is now *much* easier to get something into space.
&gt;This legislation establishes the same supportive framework that created the great economies of history

So, conquest by whichever country at the time has the power to take what it wants?

Maybe, as far as space goes, it's time to start thinking about 'us' as a planet and not a couple hundred separate entities.
"I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law, I merely enforce it."
Where's an application to become a space miner?

I want to become a space miner.
Really, it should be based on maritime salvage rights. You go get it, it's yours, barring others having a legit claim. But you can't claim it without getting there.
Can someone explain to me how this doesn't break international laws regarding space?
I remember writing my Communications speech and my English 102 final about asteroid mining only three years ago. To see the progress we've made fills me with excitement and hope that I dreamt about when I first researched the topic. 
Lets just hope we are not gonna start digging up alien markers that reanimate corpses

MAKE US WHOLE!!!!! ALTMAN BE PRAISED!!!
Does this law state that the US recognizes the property rights of any human?  If it's just recognizing Americans we are going to have some colony battles again.
So we're going to accidentally blow an asteroid into trajectory with the earth and die aren't we?
I've lived long enough that "black president signs asteroid bill into law" isn't fiction.

It's a good time to be alive.
I always knew I lived at the crossroads of history

Looking back this will be the time when mankind first exploded into the stars
Honestly if you can get there and mine it, it might as well be yours.  If you are butt hurt over that decision, the USA is probably the most inefficient gov't right now and we are still ahead of you.   
Holy shit! That means if you steal someone else's asteroid haul then you'd be a space pirate. 

We've reached the future!
Ownership of resources ultimately comes down to who has the best army.

This reminds me of the skit from Chappelle Show

"The United States of Space" 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-NkX86uPI0
As long as some multinational corporation doesn't start hurling asteroids the size of Texas on a collision course to Earth all in an effort to "maximize profits."
Sorry, boys, I’m just a tourist with a fragged nav console. Could you tell me where I am?
This seems to be incentived and synergistic forces will find a way to eliminate the industrial need to come back to earth.
Where's an application to become a space miner?

I want to become a space miner.
With some intense maths couldn't you knock an asteroid into Earths orbit with rockets and explosives and just crash land it at a test site, the only danger is an asteroid falling on lots of people because of a miscalculation of trajectory. 
Believe it or not, the Constitution has a clause providing for the acquisition of a piracy (ships and booty) permit.
Are there any wealthy businessmen on here? Can i apply to be an asteroid miner 
So lets say an alien civilization shows up some day claiming such asteroids, what then?
What?  He signed something the repubs are for? Wow.
I just did a presentation about this in my fiscals class! Asteroid mining, in my mind, will become the most important aspect in space exploration. We're taking huge potential threats to our planet and turning them into a huge source of income, jobs, and resources.  This industry will be the foundation of humanity's interplanetary endeavors.
Well, I can finally, confidently and without any indifference, no sarcasm and no controversy say:

Thanks, Obama!
Start spending that swiss bank account money instead of hoarding it, corporations. I wanna see rocket technology get the funding it needs, and I want a fleet in TEN years! The future is here mother fuckers!
As a mining geologist, I'm pretty fucking excited. Let's do some space exploration!!
Very concerned about all of the 'removed' comments. This may be an odd thing to say but. How the hell can the president of the USA sign a Bill to allow space mining. I know America think they own the planet but now the solar system! Really, they can be the ones to hand out permits. Just brilliant..
Really hoped humanity's foray into the universe would be as one. Not as greedy corporations grabbing anything they can sell. Also might open up law suits from aliens in the future. "Your rock? NO it's OUR rock!"
I've a mixed opinion on asteroid mining, especially the notion of placing them in Moon orbit. If someone forgets to carry a 2 they might wipe out billions of people. 
Seems a bit redundant. Everyone knows the solar system belongs to America to begin with. Just try to take the minerals from us.
At last, a chance for me to live out my dream as a space salvager, collecting dead satellites and debris and junked rocket components that are floating in low-earth orbit and selling the parts back to the space agencies.  


What's the difference between a celestial body and asteroid resource/space resource? **Isn't an asteroid considered as a celestial body?**

&gt; shall be entitled to any **asteroid resource or space resource obtained**, including to possess, own, transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource obtained

&amp;

&gt;It is the sense of Congress that by the enactment of this Act, the United States **does not thereby assert sovereignty or sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any celestial body**




I literally just wrote my capstone paper (end of university paper) on asteroid mining and property rights in space. Only 50 pages, but still intensely researched.
This is such a huge fucking deal that I can't even begin to impress upon you how historic this is.
Basically, several of our asteroid mining companies have been waiting for this exact document before they INTENSELY fund their projects and move forward.

If you have questions, please pm me.
Amends this bill but refuses to touch one that puts teens behind bars for having their own nudes. 

What a time to be alive. 
What kind of resources are we specifically aiming to own exactly? Or is it more just a general bill for any resources that may be viably mined?
Can someone explain what resources asteroids would have an abundance of that we don't have on earth? It seems like a really high cost factor of going to space and bringing back resources. 
I wonder what language they use to define an asteroid. Hopefully they didn't just make it legal to pirate satellites. =P
So does this mean that all the stuff I find on the property I bought on the moon is now officially mine? 
Sure, that's how it starts. Next thing you know, cats are banned and no one can fall asleep.
Good, now if their property hits your property when they botch re-entry with material you can sue them.
Meanwhile  Russia claims vast Arctic territory, seeks U.N. recognition.
Goddamn Jeff Bezos' rocket engines are still warm to the touch and the ink hasn't even dried on this bill.
Having read the bill as presented in the link ... I'm curious ...

What is to stop me from liberally interpretting the undefined term "obtain" to include hijacking other people's asteroids once they've done the hard work of redirecting their trajectory towards a near earth orbit, or another processing facility?

None that I can see. So not only has this laid the groundwork for futuristic asteroid mining, but it's set in motion the foundation of SPACE PIRACY!!!

***YARRRRRR!!!***
One big problem I see with "space property" is that on earth your land is your land. China isn't gonna say a iron mine in minnesota is theirs. Obviously it's in the US, right? Now how does that work with asteroids? What if China and the US both sell the rights or whatever to the same asteroids? How do you settle a space territory dispute?
I'm calling dibs on these...["mine"](http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/wiredscience/2010/12/saturn-rings-nasa-weiss.jpg)
So, how do you claim an asteroid? Like, let say tomorrow they find an asteroid that will come in close proximity to Earth and 5 companies all launch rockets to try to catch it. Who gets it? Who ever gets there first? (assuming they don't just pool their resources and spit it)
What if something in another part of our Galaxy already owns the rights to said "asteroid"?
888 comments, I'm ending this. alsospaceiskindacooliguessihavetostayontopic
Let's see, mining probably will happen in 40-80 years I'm guessing.  So we've only got about another 200 years before we start fighting over them and get real life Star Wars. 
If we bring large amounts of materials back to earth, won't that eventually affect our orbit around the sun? I know you can stabilize an object orbit by speeding it up if it gains more mass, but then it would affect our years and thus the seasons.  Someone do the math?
Now we need foundries and orbital shipyards. Reduce spacecraft construction surface-orbit needs to food/personnel/terrestrial finished goods/etc
Lovely, now we can buy and sell virtual resources.
World's first trillionare will come from space mining. 
I wonder if we'll look back from the future at this historic signing as a terribad awful thing like slavery, the mongol invasion, or the british invasion... 
They are secretly working on that Death Star idea that was proposed a few years ago...
Mining asteroids will be cheaper than putting people on Mars.
This completely undermines our freedom in space as space pirates and entrepreneurs. 
And this Nasa article that describes this Kickstarted company called LiftPort trying to save money by aerobraking around the Earth and take us up in it.
Better start training to be a pilot. the demand will be high.
I don't get it. Was there previously a law against this and if so why? Everything in the bill seems like it should already be the default setting.
[Puts on Cynic Hat]

As well know, democracy in legislation is dead with laws being framed and made by rich, influential individuals/companies.  

[Puts on Hat of Hope]

Several of those scum-sucking one-percenters is about to or will pour big money into space.  Let the bootstrapping begin. 

I remember hearing that this law isn't clear as to if companies are allowed to claim an area of an asteroid for mining, and then go up to mine it. Does anyone know if this vagueness was cleared up?
There's a good song about it. I think it's called 'Radioactive' by Imagine Dragons

That can't be the Milky Way, because Star Wars is set in a galaxy far far away..

Wow, seeing that thing gave me a chill. I'm amazed it's still there. 

/saw it on opening day

/related note: Empire Strikes Back came out shortly after Mt. St. Helens erupted. In Portland Oregon there was a lot of ash in the air and on the ground - fine gritty gray dust. Most people in line outside the theater had some kind of breathing and/or eye protection, from bandanas and ski goggles to full-out gas masks. The dust made the daylight weird, and nothing was shiny. It felt like we were in a bizarre alien refugee camp. 
Anything keeping somebody from like.

Living in that, or building a little home underneath it?
Have seen at least 2 dozen of these "Milky Way rising" images. What is the fascination with the Milky Way rising posts?

This is very, very curious, psychologically.

My good friend Joby Harris actually illustrated all of these posters. I sent him this picture and he said it's very encouraging that people like these so much! 
Do you have a special printer or did you take the files somewhere to have them printed? I kind of want to copy this idea! 
I did the same thing in my apartment back in September :)
http://imgur.com/DpJNIEQ
Those planets need real names, dammit!! Like Heinlein or Asimov or.....
You don't believe, but it's exactly the same for me ( with the same posters! )
ps. I thought no one else comes to mind  do it :)
Is there a subreddit for apartment decorating? this post made me want to do something to mine. Bare walls for the last 6 months lol
Budding biologist here, but if the star is redder for Kepler 186f, shouldn't the grass be any colour other than red? Red pigments would just reflect away the red light (hence the red colour) rather than absorbing the wavelength. Chlorophyll is green and has red and blue abs profile. 
I know I've been playing too much Fallout 4 when the first thing I noticed in this picture is that your lamp looks like the exact one you can craft in Fallout 4. I wish I had a picture to show it.

Steve Thomas also makes some beautiful posters with the same theme 
http://www.stevethomasart.com/#!space-travel-posters/ckbl
When I divorced my ex wife in 2007, I spent the first 6 months in my underwear unless my kids were over. I would walk into the house and drop trou a la the dad in The Goldbergs.  However, my tv never changed from The Science Channel. I would watch How It's Made or have it on in the background as I made dinner. 

One day, my son asked me why it was always on that channel. I told him that his thirst for knowledge will surpass mine's. Today, he's addicted to science videos in YouTube and watched the whole Kaplan series. 
Those posters are great! If you like vintage posters, here is a site where you can print tons of nice ones. People sell prints on eBay, but these are free:

http://www.freevintageposters.com
The true privilege is being able to practice your own taste and **discernment**.
One of the coolest things about living alone is decorating your place so as to be as close as possible to an extension of your soul.
This will go perfect with the national parks posters I  have up!
Ultimately, the most depressing thing about politics is there's no ''I vote  NASA'' box on election ballot papers
If you lived with someone else an they didn't approve of you putting something on the walls that you loved...they weren't the one for you. 
This is cool to see. I work for Kepler helping find these planets and this gave me a great pick me up to keep going. Thanks.
Wow, those are nice ! I'm moving into my new apartment this week end and this is exactly how I will decorate my big ass corridor ! Thanks :D
I want to print these! But what do i ask for at my local print shop?!
I have two questions

1. Where did you get those printed? Just a local print shop or does NASA sell them?

2. What type of frames are those and how much did they cost you?
With those, the best part is you don't ever have to worry about *not* living alone anymore!
Hey! Very nice. I also have done this! I have more similar posters, tell me if you want the files :) 
I want more of these, 'now that I live alone, I can do what I want'

Or is there a subreddit already?
protip posters usually look nicer mounted straight on to boards rather than traditional frames, they still look very professional. You trade that icky glass layer and weird not-quite-right fit of store bought frames for a nice finish and you still get the weight and definition of the distance from the wall, also you can just cut the board a little bigger if you still like the idea of a border!

Edit: by boards I mean foam or card, you can go heavier if you want but foam is pretty standard and not that pricey.
Ummm...this looks like a picture of the inside of a doll house.  Are you playing with dolls?  Is this why you live alone now?
When I read:

&gt;Now that I live alone I can do what I want

What immediately popped into my mind was:

I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
My living room is covered in camping gear.  My spare bedroom is a lab.  The kitchen is all mine.  I don't wear clothes at home.  

I love living alone.

They look wonderful! I've always wanted to do a similar thing with New Yorker covers.
Awesome man. I can't wait until I have my own house someday, will go all out with images like these!
These are awesome! Anything else like this exist? Space wise? 
I'm seriously running out of wall space in my office, but I've got to find a way to make room for these.
Wow that is great. So cool those are available for free. What did you print them with?
I really like the style of these images, does anyone know of others similar to this?
whoa, what the hell is that pylon of light. never seen a lamp like that
These are so cool! And I love the frames you picked for them!
Man, I can't wait to live alone AND be able to decorate. Damned military barracks.
What size did you print these off as

Anyone got a link to some frames?
these are brilliant!

Saving them to print later...
My room was 3 feet from the store same day but $29.99 if it's mailed to you.
My wife and I have them printed on fabric and hanging on the wall. :)
Poster size? Doesn't it depend on the size of the posters?
These were full size in an exhibit at the JPL open house last month. Really cool
I would watch How It's Made or have it on in the fact that Wallmart did not exist the state.
I sent him this picture is that your lamp looks like the exact same size prints at Costco are 8 bucks if you get the 16x20 prints.
-Poster-size NASA travel ads! Thank you, NASA, for making these amazing images

Thank you - my stupid friends that work at NASA never told me they make these cool posters.  
Greetings fellow space tourist: http://i.imgur.com/DPMFgqu.jpg

And now you can rollerblade in the house without anyone telling you how it's a bad idea! (For some reason that was my first move when she left, it was glorious)
I love these! Got a plan to do something similar with old F1 posters. 
I think they look nice. I was saying because I wouldn't know where to get it framed cheap.
there is another poster - it says "explore the universe"  and a cartoon astronaut - does anyone know where i might find it? can't find it on the site... 
So cool! Did you just print them out or did you order them from somewhere?
Any place where you can buy them? With like the proceeds going to NASA?
oh, so this isn't a fallout related post? b/c it looks like it from the image

I don't live alone, but I have the HD-4307 one framed. 
Very nice! How did you get perfect sized frames?
Steve Thomas also makes some beautiful posters with the national parks posters I have up!
How is this kind of art style called? I really like the style i just not necessarily like the space theme.

That is sweet! I planned to do the same thing with different galaxies and Mars shots.
i have that same soft  blanket with the lovely little birds on it. And I love your posters

Have those same ones in my apartment! Good choices 
People don't think to use them for this kind of stuff, but I had mine at Kinkos and bought matching clearance frames at IKEA, so I'm assuming it's anIKEA floor lamp.
With those, the best part is you don't ever have to worry about *not* living alone anymore!
I love the mild tone of retro going on. I think some people go a little overboard with it, but I think this is a perfect amount.
I'm having trouble determining what the last one on the far right reads. Can anyone help?
Fun fact: decorators call this frame height (far up towards the ceiling) public style. Typically for homes art is centered at 57" from the floor for optimal viewing while standing or seated, but many businesses (hotels in particular) hang art up high toward the ceiling like that to avoid people leaning or setting things against the frames. 
You don't believe, but it's exactly the same for me ( with the same posters! ) ps. I thought no one else comes to mind do it :)
Those chairs are the ones your parents sat and watched moon landing ?
Isn't that awesome?! I love the frames at Bed bath and beyond.
Nothing beats living alone. You don't have to take crap from anyone.
F yeah, nasal! I love the posters. Get more and make some wallpaper! 
Now that you live alone? What kind of person wouldn't want this awesomeness on the wall?
NASA was giving them out at the International Astronomical Union conference in Honolulu but you had to know who to ask. I'm glad there are high resolution files available for the DIY minded person.
I did this at work, in my office, for fictional places. Beat way to work in the gaming and scfi interests with the office decor. I have Arrakis, Rapture, and Gallifrey. Love yours, though! May need to add to the collection.
That guy has a red lightsaber. I don't trust him. I wouldn't let him on the Space Station.
I hope some alien civilisation is halfarsedly observing us, and has seen both this poster and clips from the star wars films and is now shitting themselves.
Hm. There's a face hidden one one of the telescopes (Or space modules?):
http://fused.com/face.png

Anyone know who it belongs to? :)
"What color lightsaber do you want?"

"Gray."

".. uh.. you sure?"

"Yes. Gray."

"Okay..."
I fucking love NASA!   Give them more money!  Seriously why aren't they looking into crowd funding?  Are they?
Am I the only one that was expecting 45 ISS crew members in the photo?
Tell me there's some way for them to watch The Force Awakens whilst up there!
The guy on the bottom left is an Emergency Medicine doctor as well as an astronaut!
Have they done a Stargate SG1 picture for any of the crews?

If not, they need to.

Some of the most highly trained and intelligent people on the planet, who routinely risk their lives to breach the final frontier... and they're still a bunch of nerds who would dress up like Jedi.  Love it. 
At first glance, the thumbnail looked like a Guardians of the Galaxy poster.

There...wasn't any real change in awesomeness.
I look at the blue lightsaber dude and all I see is Nicholas Cage's eyes.
My first thought (seeing the guy in the upper left on a mobile device) was: why did they pose all those astronauts in Star Wars gear, but also include Nathan Fillion?

It would be cool if Disney sued Nasa, the media shitstorm would probably propel funding for Nasa to unreal heights.

Come on Disney, embrace the dark side for science!
That X shape of solar panels of ATV seemed like something from SW universe that for moment i didn't even realize it is real thing.
Question: would VL be a valid way to write 45 in roman numerals?
Maybe I'm reading into this too much, but I totally see Mr. Lindgren and Mr. Kelly as Plato and Aristotle from [*The School of Athens*](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Sanzio_01_Plato_Aristotle.jpg). But it was probably just a coincidence 'cause that's what "I can use the force" hand gestures look like. 
I absolutely love that a bunch of space nerds took a super nerdy space picture. This is so good! 
This really is blatant and official government sponsorship of a religion (the force). This needs to be stopped so that we don't have Christian and Muslim groups demanding equal time in space.
This is freaking awesome! The bottom left dude looks like Mark Cuban 
I don't know who's been doing the marketing for NASA for the last 10 years or so BUT THEY ARE GODDAMN GENIUSES.  

Sorry for the language - but during the shuttle era space was literally too boring to tune in to.  NASA had it's budget chopped all to heck and we're more interested in what they're doing than we ever were.  
I find it hilarious they're all dressed like Obi-Wan. I just picture these Nasa guys geekin out over the poster idea and someone says they call Obi, and then someone else points out that he isnt even in the new movie and eventually that leads to everyone showing up dressed like Obi. I realize they may have just been going for generic Jedi #'s 1-6 but those are Obi costumes. 

So the day of the shoot comes, and clearly everyone realizes they kinda look silly all dressed the same, but its too late.

Based on their expressions you can get an idea of what they're thinking when the photo was taken. 

Going from right to left, starting at the bottom right as 1 and going up and around so that the bottom left is 6.

1. "I just look like Lord Varys wandered onto the wrong set."

2. "I shouldn't have let them talk me into this, I wanted to do Doctor Who."

3. "Let me seduce you with my force powers, sexy camera lady."

4. "No, let me seduce you with my force powers!"

5. "Oh my." (ala Takei)

6. "Stop. Just stop, we all look like tools dressed the same like this. Look I'm holding a Red saber, and I'm supposed to be a Jedi?! This shit isnt rocket science people, trust me, I work for Nasa."
Have they done a Stargate SG1 picture for any of the crews?

If not, they need to.

Love how the entire comments section is about the dude with the red lightsaber.
Just had to add this. 


In Sweden the surname Lindgren is very common in the community of Finnish gypsies (romas?) and the name is kind of associated with all the negative things gypsies are supposedly known for (stealing, robbing, scamming yada yada...), so a red saber is "fitting" for the guy. 


For the record, I do not share those negative views on gypsies. 


Also,  wicked photo! :) 
The nerdiest part of all of this is that they included Expanded Universe lightsaber colours.
Can someone tell me where I can get a Jedi costume of that caliber?
I thought Chakoti (bottom left) was a fictional character from Star Trek Voyager turns out he is a real astronaut. 
Who did the hilts? They don't look like Parks... ultrasabers, perhaps?
Geez, I'm gonna need a warning next time. The 38,880,000 pixels brought Chrome to a crawl.
Dang, there's 3 Russians and only 1 American on the ISS?
Not being funny, but I think some of this image might have been photoshopped. Shame on NASA. 
I feel like the second guy on the left side came in dressed as Spock because of a miscommunication and they just threw that robe on.
This just proves that Star Wars is the biggest movie to come out since... I don't know Lord of the Rings? Maybe even further back.
As a photographer I have a new goal in life, to work with NASA to shoot an ISS Expedition poster. 
I'm not sure if it's just Late or if the guy top right bares a resemblance to Nicholas cage 
The only thing that could make this better is if one of the astronauts had snuck in the Vulcan salute.
For some reason posts like this always remind me of Revenge of the Nerds. Specifically: https://youtu.be/Nke0Gj2SUOs

Am I the only one? 
Have these guys not heard of the Outbound Flight? This is inauspicious. Although, I guess it isn't because it ain't canon anymore.
Well...it's confirmed, NASA is the highest obtainable club for sci-fi nerds. Gods love 'em!!
I zoomed in for days and couldn't find a single pixel :D
I feel assured knowing we are sending only our best nerds into space.
When this is why we get attacked by aliens, I'm going to be so happy!
They totally did this so Disney can send a copy of Force Awakens with them.
Question: would VL be a valid way to write 45 in roman numerals?

This may be unpopular, and I do love Star Wars, but this is a tad cringe-worthy. NASA astronauts actually going into space is way more badass than a fictional portrayal of mystics waving around impossibly dangerous weapons.


No women or black representation in this picture? Food Strike! Ban the reporters!

Triggered.
What's with Mars in this poster? Are they doing Mars mission related stuff?
5400x7200 image. Nothing really remarkable about that, but originally I thought it was all black seeing only the upper left side (my browser had been zoomed).
Dude on the bottom left looks like a rugby player. I'd be sure to steer clear of that particular Sith. 
I'm starting to think that a time traveler came back in time give George Lucas ideas on Star Wars. And then because of how popular it becomes we will begin trying to really hard to replicate things from the movies. 

Something something we end up like the Star Wars universe.
Dude with the white saber, you're my hero! White sabers never get any representation.
Come on guys, everyone knows Spock is from Sfar Trek, not Star Wars.
Just goes to show that even some astronauts didn't get laid in high school.
I didn't know Phil Collins (bottom right) was finally accepted!! Way to go, Phil! 

You'll be in my heart when you're in the air tonight. And for you it's just another day in paradise, against all odds of course. Do you accept congrats texts from strangers like me? If so, don't lose my number.
Seen this before. Isn't this from like half a year ago?
He's not a Jedi, I can see right through his ruse. Those eyebrows are a giveaway that he's sneaking into the wrong franchise
The guy with the blue lightsaber looks remarkably like Nicolas Cage.
This is a great fuckin picture. The crew looks so convincing. Should be castes in the movie 
Let's not forget that they named an actual spaceship the Enterprise and started all this! STAR TREK RULES! 
Hey guys can someone explain the actually science they are doing ? What types of experiments and tests or just what a typical day involves?

Hm. There's a face hidden one one of the telescopes (Or space modules?):

Unfortunately, it appears being a Jedi is a prerequisite to becoming an astronaut these days...
When the human race is destroyed and the aliens find the star wars movies and this is, they're gonna think we were really cool
So I have to be ancient to be an astronaut all these guys look over 40
Their logo looks suspiciously like a star destroyer. ....are we the bad guys?
Dude on the bottom left looks like a rugby player. I'd be sure to steer clear of that particular Sith. 
Cool poster, but they should've used orange for Lindgren's lightsaber. Red crystals are only used by the Sith, and he's dressed in Jedi Master Garb.

Oh no..... My inner nerd is showing.... *runs away*
That picture is so high-rez, when you zoom-in those guys are scary close!
How many blow up dolls/ flesh lights do you think they'll bring? Or are they just gonna fuck each other 
I love these guys! We should really be giving these nerds all the money they want. They already do so much with so little!
It's interestin how Russian look Russian and you can easily pick them out from the other white guys.
Not a single representation for the dark side,  so disappointing.  But this also shows the true meaning of balance Mr. Darth brought to the universe.
I believe this is considered a quasar, that is, a supermassive black hole that consumes matter and converts it into screaming electromagnetic waves (or other things)—they are thought to be the nuclei of distant galaxies.
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but I seem to recall that in that picture the black hole isn't eating those clouds, but rather emitting them? It's been a while so I don't quite remember the details. 

:(
My god.... That must be hundreds of thousands of light years across.
[A supermassive black hole actually in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7xl_zjz0o8)
I was waiting for the image to animate. Then again, considering the timescale of the universe, it could be animating.
This looks fake, anyone please prove me wrong because this would be awesome if it is real?
It's strange to see such massive objects visible from so far away.

For instance each one of those galaxies in the background are easily 100 million light years across. 

Light has to travel 100 million years just to traverse the span of one of those small spiral thingies in the background of this image.

That just befuddles me, it's absolutely maddening how large space is. We as children are taught a (ex·treme·ly) vague concept of the universe/space.

What is even more amazing to me is that in the background, most of those objects are entire galaxies filled with billions of their own stars.
Is there a way I can schedule a trip into a blackhole in like 60 years so I can settle this matter on a personal level? When I'm near death, I'd be okay dying (or living somehow) by purposefully entering a black hole. 
After reading through the comments, my head is broken. I just can't fathom how that's a galaxy and its 15x wider than ours (let alone 100x more massive). Super structures of space are Incredible.
This picture reminds me of the cell cycle. Specifically Telophase, where one cell is about to become two. The interconnectedness of the universe is apparent both macroscopically and microscopically it seems. 
NASA Goddard uploaded an interesting video to YouTube the other day, explaining the basics of supermassive black holes. It's called "Our Violent Universe". Well worth your time.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSZUh3yqg-0
Thought this was a gif and stared at it for longer than I'd like to admit [7]
Where is it? I see no black hole? I see bright light in the middle.
I would like to know why there are lens flares from the stars on these kinds of pictures. And what determines the angle that they protrude. Sometimes I see them up and down, left and right instead of at a diagonal like in this picture.
How has no one mentioned the song by the same title?

http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bBb-J0hcBQA
Wow, looks an awful lot like mitosis! http://www.molbiolcell.org/content/17/10.cover-expansion 

Hopefully someone can help me with a question I've had on these for a while...

Why do the jets seem to be affected by some resistance? The behavior is very similar to what you would expect to see if you squirt dye into water, with a narrow initial stream that slows down and forms a cloud further out.  In the vacuum of space, what causes this behavior instead of a steady constant narrow cone type of situation?
So I'm confused, is this an actual image taken from space or just a mock up of what it would look like?
Wow the jets are so much bigger than the galaxy itself

Imagine being in the path of one of those
Actually, those super bright things in the background are also black holes in action. Black holes with accretion disks, that is, also known as quasars, also known as black holes that had a star come a little too close. 
For some reason when clicked this picture, my brain thought it was a gif and I was staring at it for about 2 mins before my brain said fuck sakes its just a picture.  
At what point would it start becoming lethal to be near it?
someone please explain what im looking at here. 
I wonder what those jets are hitting causing it to suddenly disperse into a sphere at each end rather than just continuing in a straight line?  And why at roughly the same distance?
Why do the relativistic jets disperse like that? Is it because of scattering off of interstellar particles? or why would they slow down and balloon out?
Why isn't gravitational lensing of surrounding galaxies more apparent if the black hole is so massive?
Can someone cinemagraph this to show its behavior?
glaciers melting in the dead of night and the super star was sucked into the supermaaasssive......
Serious question: is this a real image, that anyone with time, skills and their own  ridiculously powerful space telescope could see, and it would look exactly like that? Or is this what people seem to always refer to as an "artist impression" of a very lower quality or very different image or even of a bunch of numbers extracted from the logs of measurements equipment (like radio telescopes stuff)?
I always remember being told quasars were "baby galaxies", didn't know they were typically supermassive black holes.
It's incredible how big those "jets of clouds" would have to be.
So about how big is this thing in relation to our sun?
Cannot help but imagine that the matter being consumed and turned into those ejected jetstreams *could* conceivably include an intelligent civilization in the process of being annihilated.
Are those star looking things on the background galaxies?! :0
Question - is the light we see at the center the accretion disk? Is it possible to see the actual black hole with our naked eye in this pic?
Woah...a real photo that shows a black hole? How many photos like this are there?
So uh, from the left cloud's tip to the right's, how large is the distance between them?
I thought supermassive black holes didn't have the jet and accretion disk, that they just swallowed things whole.

Or is this incorrect?
If that is a black hole, why do we see light, especially at that intensity, at the center where the black hole would be?
Then he realized that the quasar itself is a subclass of quasar where we are looking almost directly down the beam.
How big is that, anyway? Do we have any idea how long it would take to form?
I´ve seen movies where black things are supermassive... Havent seen a space setting yet though.
My question: Is it normal that the thought of this scares the living hell out of me?
Wow the jets which tend to be really really close to a decent radius.
I can't believe I just sat here and looked at this image for 15 seconds thinking I was watching a realistically depicted slow gif of an incredible spacial phenomenon.

When the gif seemed to be moving too slow, I clicked on the screen to move the video to a later stage to see a bigger difference. 

That's when I realised why I am not a scientist.

That's when I realised it was an image, not a gif.

And I couldn't believe I sat here watching an image with such awe.

And after writing so far, I am still thinking of what else to write.

I have nothing else to write.

I'll go watch another image or something.
This is a Quasar. Almost no quasars look this good so I assume it's an artist rendition or something. The current theory is that matter around a spinning black hole in what's called an 'accretion disc' is super heated by tidal friction and just the general energy of system to the point where it explodes off into two distinct jets of opposite directions. Generally these super massive black holes are thought to be at the center of a Galaxy and there is evidence that there is a super massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Some even believe that the Milky Way Galaxy has already produced a Quasar. 

Quasars are extremely long and are propelled by the magnetic field generated by the plasma in the accretion disk (when matter gets really hot it becomes charged as it becomes stripped of its electrons. Spinning charges make magnetic fields. Magnetic fields propel charged matter). 

The reason Quasars never really look this good is that one beam tends to be pointing closer to us while the other is pointing farther away. If the Quasar were to come directly toward us it would appear to be a giant blotch. If it is slightly angled, the closer jet will appear but the farther jet may be moving away from us so quickly that the light from it is red shifted and dim. This makes it, generally speaking, difficult to see the farther jet. 
Wait, i thought that black holes where never seen but only theorised about.
Can someone explain what I am looking at, is it taking in matter from one end and spitting it out the other? or are those big clouds the ends of the disk that is the black hole?
Another potentially amazing space pic that means absolutely nothing to me or to most people. What are we seeing here other than blobs of brightly coloured string? 

And just to clarify is that what we would actually see if we looked at it or is this another of those fake ones where it turns out you would see nothing like this because none of it is visible...? 

These pictures are frustrating.
A black hole's gravity is strong enough to suck in light to. We see light coming out of it. Therefore, it isn't a black hole, but something else.
Weren't we just debating whether or not black holes actually exist a few years ago? What changed?
It's hard to fathom just how huge these things are.

And that's coming from someone who's stood next to one at Cape Canaveral. (Which I believe is the same one as in the photo.)
I was just at Johnson Space Center yesterday. It's totally unfathomable to understand the scale of these things. Even sitting in a room with it, it's almost mythical

I visited the Kennedy Space Center and was able to see this first hand.  It's simply mind boggling to come to the realization that human hands built this.  [This](http://i.imgur.com/xuLSb5j.jpg) is a picture I took of one of the engines.  There are so many individual parts that had to work in harmony without failure... Just incredible.

Kind of off topic, but I was also amazed at how many people from different countries were there as well.  They spoke different languages and dressed differently,  but the look of awe and wonder on a person's face is universal.  What a wonderful experience.
That's so cool. I have a similar picture of me there as well! http://imgur.com/duWvxtR
Last year, by chance, I went to see all three of the Saturn V displays. KSC and Houston for work trips that I added a day to in order to go visit the NASA stuff in the area, and a trip with my son's Cub Scout troop to Huntsville. 

Way cool!!!
Here is a comparison next to the space shuttle, and other rockets

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/50/Maximum_payload.PNG
I took this picture. I was at KSC with a robotics team from my school for competition and we took a tour of the Saturn V facility. This is of one of my teammates. I knew she posted it to Imgur and Facebook but its pretty cool that it's now resurfacing on the front page for me.
Saw the one in Houston last summer.

Awesome is the only word to describe it, in the way the word was originally intended to be used. 
It's amazing to think that what took us to the Moon 50 years ago was the top of the line back then, but nowadays our smartphones have more a powerful CPU than what guided the rockets.
I will stand by the fact that the Saturn V is the single greatest man made invention of the modern era.  You can tell me that vaccines, other medicines, hybrid cars, etc. are more impactful/relevant... but given the level of technology at the time and the impact it had on our SPECIES, this single controlled explosive is absolutely the the most amazing thing we've ever made as a civilization.  
Is the Saturn V named because it was the fifth version of the rocket design, or because it has five thrusters?
I took a [video](https://youtu.be/vdFdnPH-npk) of me walking the length of the rocket a few years ago. Nevermind the goofy commentary it was only intended to be seen by a few friends. Also vertical video, i have since seen the error in my ways.
I don't know what is more impressive: That we built a machine that got us to the moon, or the fact we did this in the fucking sixties. The sixties! Computers no more powerful than a pocket calculator, no previous exploratory missions, JFK said we would land on the moon before 1970, and holy shit we did.
I remember sleeping in sleeping bags under that monster of a rocket for 5th grade space camp.
I was there in Jan! Used a GoPro to try and capture the whole thing (still failed). http://imgur.com/a/wQevi
[I have a picture from the exact same spot!](http://i.imgur.com/UTjdJda.jpg)
I'm always fascinated by the S-II stage of the Saturn V.

With the first stage they were like "let's cram as much power as we can into this baby, screw weight!"

But with the S-II they were like "ok, you need to shave off weight. Yeah, keep shaving. 92.4% fuel? Ok, stop shaving weight."
I just went to this 2 summers ago. It was really cool! I enjoyed it. 
Where did these rockets come from? Where they just some spares they had out the back or prototypes that are engineering mock ups? 

Seems like an awful lot of money sitting around on display.
That's at KSC, right? If it is, I've slept under it for a night during a 5th grade field trip to KSC in 2009.
I went there a few years ago. [Here's a picture I took of it (no human or banana for scale, sorry).](http://imgur.com/u6siVrF)  

The Saturn V is the largest and probably the most amazing rocket I have ever seen. It still amazes me whenever I see pictures of it, especially with a human for scale.  

This thing fucking sent us to the moon. 46 years ago. *That's* fucking amazing.

Not on topic, but did anyone else walk near the lights underneath the rocket? They seemed *really* hot when I was there.
I hope some day soon we can look back on this image the same way we'd look back at the size of a computer taking up an entire room not too long ago.
We should have never stopped flying these things. The Shuttle, although very cool, was entirely impractical and doesn't come close to a V in the amount of stuff it can take to space. God dammit Nixon.
I was just there in April! Had an incredible time. You're told how big these things are.. but I was literally speechless when I saw how massive they were in person. The Saturn V was unreal. Thinking of sitting on top of that thing right before take off made my butthole pucker a bit. 
"Too bad propulsion technology hasn't advanced as fast as CPU tech has since the 60's."  Agreed.  It's market-driven.  Consumer demand makes CPU tech more profitable than propulsion technology.  Space exploration is a "public good" in (Public Finance 101 terms) and therefore needs more govt $.  It's always been that way (eg, Christopher Columbus needed govt money also.)  I wish humanity cared enough about space exploration...think about what we'd already have accomplished.
[Here are some pics](http://imgur.com/a/mb9am) I took back in August.
Awesome! [Here's me in the same spot two years ago.](http://i.imgur.com/QF5T9id.jpg)
stood there a few weeks ago and was blown away
I don't think I ever realized the bottom was 'plated up'. I'm surprised there's anything at all there, really.
... Holy god that's gorgeous. Thank you for this picture.
Someone needs to photoshop this into a movie poster. /r/photoshopbattles get on it.
Last year we got the chance to hold a banquet underneath this giant. It was amazing. They set it up after closing so that all of the other visitors already left. It was pitch black outside, but key structures and the inside of this hall were still lit,. It was an indescribable experience and I'm very thankful that NASA gave us this opportunity.
I remember that felling of finishing of the recording of going around the moon, then walking out and BAM!! You see the rocket. 
Went there this summer. It's as impressive IRL as it looks on the photo.
I've stood in that spot. It's not easy to wrap your head around the size of the thing, much less to imagine the firepower coming out of those engines. But in a couple of years, we'll have a rocket with even more power. Can't wait to see that one.

I stood next to one of these in Houston. It looks big in pictures, but my god it is crazy to stand next to one of these and picture it blasting off into space. 
I got a similar shot of it, but there's just no good way to show how long it is. Plus, it was a bit more crowded that day.

There's [one in Houston](http://www.jefflewis.net/graphics/galveston_&amp;_caverns/DSC00192-Saturn_V,_JSC,_Houston.jpg), if that's closer than Florida for you.
I've stood under this!

Truly an awesome experience that everyone should have at some point in their life.
...designed with pencil and paper.
Awe inspiring. To think that men would actually strap themselves to the front of that badboy.

Saw the one in Houston last summer.

Awesome is the only word to describe it, in the way the word was originally intended to be used. 
People are saying it's in the Johnson space center. Wasn't it in the Kennedy space station (FL) a few years back??
I took this exact same picture. In fact, I even took a picture of a rocket launch from International Drive. I ain't gonna post it, though, because then that would be the 19th time this has been reposted.
Yes. That is a prime example of an We're-not-fucking-around-here type machine. 
Pictures like this make me think "If aliens ever came to earth and saw things like this, maybe, just maybe they wouldn't think we're all that stupid." Of all the other stupid shit we do, things like this make me proud to be a human.
If you guys like this kind of stuff check out the movie named "In the Shadow of the Moon". That is my all-time-favorite "human achievement" type movie.
Small fact; it is the the most powerful machine humans have ever built. The thrust to weight ratio of the Saturn V and the guidance mechanisms should be THE WONDER of the human race.
My father was director of testing for the Saturn V program.  We lived outside Tullahoma, Tennessee, at Arnold Air Force Station, which was close enough to water and TVA power but far enough away to not bother anyone.  The station was purpose built to house the facility, and the living quarters housed the military personnel who worked at the base.  The testing facility was miles away from the housing area, which itself was surrounded by dense woods.  You could hear the roar of the engines and the wind tunnel when they were testing, and could feel the ground pulse of the noise and power.  The sound was like the loudest, biggest, baddest thunderstorm of all time, but octaves lower and more pervasive and menacing. 

We have one where I'm from in Huntsville. It's still scary as fuck to walk under that thing.
I did a Honeywell leadsership thing there and got to have a nice dinner underneath it!
More like "the rocket that put the thing that sent us to the moon into space."
Did you know that just one of those F-1 engines has more thrust than the entire Space Shuttle has on launch?

And that when they were made, American scientists and engineers were still using Customary?

Pretty crazy.
I live less than a mile from this place! (Huntsville)

They do beer gardens, it's awesome getting drunk under this rocket!!!
I've been lifted up to grab both of those bottom engines, spent too many hours there when I did tours there
Looks like this was taken in the Davidson Center at the Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL. Amazing place!
Kennedy Space Center. As someone who lives in Florida, the Disney parks are cool, Universal studios is fun, but KSC is my favorite place to visit.

Is this at Kenedy space center? If so I got to sleep under this thing on a fifth grade field trip, pretty awe inspiring
You need to go see the upright mock-up in Alabama.  It's breathtaking. http://i.imgur.com/YYNs61u.jpg
Wow, I never really thought about how huge this thing must have been. That's insane.
[This](http://i.imgur.com/c4fUpbl.jpg) shows the amazing size of that rocket compared to other rockets.
I was at that museum when I went down for the last shuttle launch. Really amazing stuff.
I had the chance to speak to one of the engineers that worked on the rocket. He said that it took I think 5 tries before they got the rocket to work. 
Those were the days!  5.0L v8s and Saturn V moon rockets.  No one cared about MPG back then.
That first stage burned about 13 tons of fuel a second for just around 2 minutes. 

Here's a high speed video from a Saturn V launch: http://youtu.be/_HcnmthntUo
20 tones of fuel per SECOND. 7.5 million lbs of thrust, the most powerful machine the human species have ever devised. Truly incredible
The Saturn V is still the most powerful vehicle to ever carry humans. Or anything.
First thing I thought was 'but if it went to the moon, how is it still intact down here?'. I am not a smart man.
That's gotta be Kennedy space center. I visited it a few years back. All the way from Denmark. 
You know what I like about this rocket? The fact that I use its measurement to tell authorities to quit harassing me when I tell them the maximum range for flying my quad-copter is 400 feet which is just slightly higher than the Saturn V rocket which reaches 363 feet.

Related. I always get shivers when you see that massive stream of exhaust moving despite being recorded with a 500 fps high speed camera
I want to see this so badly, I could sell my kidneys for the gas money there, however, I want to go after I graduate from my Engineering school.  I want to be able to truly admire the awesome and the complexity, not just go "oooooo big rocket!"  This would be like my Mecca and I envy everyone who gets to see it.  One day though, I will be the happiest man alive.
This is my "happy page" about the F1 engine used in the first stage.  Best illustrations/breakdown I have found.  Also a good section on combustion design and pulse oscillation/shockwave concerns.

Wouldn't it have been easier going straight up, instead of sideways?
So how many Saturn V's are there and which one is the real one, not too familiar with this.
So do those things just come plummeting back to the earth when they detach?
Amazing machine, I guess it's still the most powerful rocket ever made?..The Inspirals had a tribute to it back in the days of Britpop too...

Saturn 5, you really were the greatest sight
Stretching out on A summer's day
Houston, it's calling me back to her
An eagle lands, and A planet full of people raises it's hands
All hail the men who will walk up in heaven today
The Space &amp; Rocket Center in Huntsville, AL.  This exploded view of the Saturn V is amazing, you don't understand how huge these things were until you're under it.  I was at a conference there this summer and we had a dinner reception under this thing, it was one of the coolest things I've gotten to do (also there was an open bar so that helps).
That's at KSC, right? If it is, I've slept under it for a night during a 5th grade field trip to KSC in 2009.
i got on reddit on a weekday afternoon and browsed for an hour to get this picture of the Great Orion Nebula.
Thankyou, seeing incredible pictures like this is just beautiful. If its not too impolite how much would it cost to enable a picture such as this?
So dope! I was in Ritewood CA last night getting a star lapse on my 5D3/70-200. Where'd you go? What equipment did you use?
posts with titles like this always remind me of [this](https://36.media.tumblr.com/cdb616311e65a4d6fb9071b2385d77f1/tumblr_mmt0t0Tttr1r4edc9o1_500.jpg)
Nice image! You've got a fair amount of bloom that could be filtered out to increase the contrast.
In the Nebula so clear in these conditions that you can actually see it? Or does is require some after shot edits or something?

I apologize for my ignorance I've just never had the opportunity to see something like this in person so it's making my head spin a tad
I know it's a stupid question, but how do these photographers capture pictures like this
Did it have the purple and blue colors with your naked eye?  or is that something the camera does?
I will never see anything like this. I live in NJ, and too poor to travel to California never mind ever being able to afford your camera. I Thank you, this made my day
Wow you drove _3 whole hours_ and stayed up in _3am_ in the _COLD???!?!?!!11_
The background made me realize just how much we are living in an ocean of stars.
Great picture. But "3 am in the cold" in the California dessert? So like 50 degrees? Maybe 40?
Anyone else seeing a [red cobra](http://i.imgur.com/Wc4ToJK.gif) in the middle there?

Can't unsee, amazing pic!

EDIT: Added [gif](http://i.imgur.com/Wc4ToJK.gif)
Absolutely beautiful. Are those colours natural?

It looks exactly like a turkey, also.
interesting composition. Why is there parallax in the image, with the larger stars literally appearing in the "foreground"? With this distance, isn't essentially everything at infinity, thereby negating the effects of parallax?
What impresses me even more than the nebula is the star density next to it. I was only able to photograph it under medium to high light pollution and never saw this amount of stars.
Absolutely incredible. Thank you OP. What a feeling it must be to see this in your camera. 
This bugs me -- great work by the way -- because I camped for two nights in Death Valley and didn't end up with a single good picture. I rented a bunch of astronomy gear, and couldn't get proper alignment on the mounts for accurate clock motor tracking and I couldn't get any of the cameras focused properly. All of that made worse by it being pitch black outside. Major major disappointment but it was still amazing after we gave up to just sit back and stargaze. 
It's just amazing how our universe has been formed, and how the constant evolution of the stars and galaxies, as well as this nebula, continues to advance. Beautiful photo, and thanks for the effort!
Awesome, thank you OP.   

Totally worth it......^though^I^put^in^no^effort
Did it look anywhere near as amazing to the naked eye? I ask because I've been around aurora before and they rarely look as good to the eye as they do on film
Was this taken in Death Valley? I'm thinking of making a trip out there soon.
Nice job on the HDR image, and a decent about of the surrounding IFN, too.  M42 is both an easy and challenging target, this is better than most of the images you see of it.  Well done!
I envy you. That sounds like it would have been a lot of fun. Great photo and thanks for sharing it!! 
Hi, I live in California and have just recently started getting into astronomy. I wonder if there is any desire to do a reddit meetup star party or tutorial or something? sorry if this is the wrong forum to post this.
Just curious. When you are out there can you see this with your naked eye or is this bc of zoom and long exposure?
It's crazy the photos you can take with the new iPhone
You should arrange a more convenient meeting time and place with whoever gave you the picture next time
That's Mufasa. He's facing the left, and holding his paw up on the left as well. Its really just his face, his eyes, hairline, and mouth. He looks angry. Definitely not a nebula
I think your drive was time well spent.  That is an amazing picture of the nebula.         That and Saturn are my two favorite objects to view through a telescope.


This is dedication. Thank you for sharing your work.
That's too cool, I've always wanted to photograph space like this. Thanks for sharing this and some of your professional knowledge too.
That's really beautiful. Does anyone know what it would be like to live on a planet there? If it's even possible, would it be really bright all the time?
Looks awesome. I'm so happy it's the winter again, because I'll be able to spot this beauty every night!
Is it just me, or is there a bear in this picture? 
Absolutely breath taking! Might I ask what kind of camera you used? 
This is beautiful. Quite an amazing shot.

Makes me wonder what I'm missing out on due to light pollution. 
Just an FYI you can buy [this](http://www.telescopes.com/products/zhumell-z10-deluxe-dobsonian-reflector-telescope) telescope for the low price of $550 and see this nebula, among other fantastic celestial bodies. The best part is you don't even have to drive 3 hours into the desert to do so - if you can see Orion then you can see the nebula with your naked eye already. Unless you live in a super-light polluted area then you can see some really good stuff.

I owned this telescope for a while and my gf and I would take it in our backyard and see some great things. A couple years back Venus transited the Sun and we set it up to see it. It was really cool, we put a filter on the lens, pointed it at the sun and then held up a piece of paper and it projected the image onto it. If you're interested I'll see if she can dig up the photos. (The heat ended up shattering the filter we put on the lens, but worth it.)
that was actually the first thing I 'found' when I got my first telescope ~10 years old.  I ran into the house thinking I discovered something.  I would just randomly turn the knobs scanning the sky.  found Saturn that way too.
I badly wish we could see this stuff every night with the naked eye, it'd be amazing 
Awesome pic! Have you ever seen a ufo while camped out in the desert looking up at the sky?
So what are you complaining about?  ;)  haha, just kidding. The way you worded it made me chuckle. But I know you were trying to convey that getting great shots of space is not a trivial endeavor. It is indeed a great shot. Well done. :)
I totally though the thumbnail was the same picture it with fog and water droplets all over your lens and this was going to be a "I fucked up" Kinda thing.  But great shot! :)
I think I'd cry if I saw that in person, it just seems too big to comprehend.
I truly respect this photo, and the work that's been put into it.

But... I can't possibly be the only one that sees the penis in the middle. Call me a child, and claim I have no respect for art, but that's a penis.

I'm sorry...
Gotta respect you for your efforts there! Good luck even seeing half those stars anywhere in the UK night sky.
Wow, what a beautiful picture.  It's amazing that there are still places where light pollution doesn't ruin our view of the stars.
HOLY SHIT!!!!!  I've been absolutely obsessed with going out to the desert (I'm in Atlanta, GA, so not a quick trip) to see if I can see the Milky Way.

Thanks for sharing!  Can you say more specifically where you were and if you think there are any better places out west to see stars?  It will be expensive for me to go out there, so I want to get the best spot the first time, if possible.
Thanks for the effort you went to to get this image. Beeeeeuuuuuutiful. 
Amazing picture.
Living in the city limits you to see something as beautiful as this. 
Where I live we have Fremonts Peak. (Central california) 
Can someone explain how a camera can catch such great photos? Is it just the type of lens used? Thanks in advance!
what parts are in the background and what parts are in the foreground?
This is spectacular. I want to get into astrophotography. I noticed it's not super sharp, is that just the way it was captured, the equipment used or just the way it is supposed to be?
This is beautiful! When I'm done with college, I want to take a vacation anywhere that I can see a night sky not polluted by city lights. I've always wanted to see scenes like this, as well as auroras!
Spectacular picture and it makes me sad. I haven't seen the stars like that in a very long time. 
wait... who's Orian; because someone should totally tell him something weird is up with his belt.. Awesome pic dave!
wow i wish i could see this in real life im from europe sadly 
when u see it it must feel so super weird or makes u feel so alive 
This is absolutely beautiful! Assuming that photography is your passion, keep doing what youre doing! Hope you don't mind if I set this as my lock screen :)
Not sure what's more badass, the picture or the journey to get there.
Awesome picture! But why does every photo someone post have to be.. I had to drive 100 miles, hike 10 miles, stub their toe and ward an army of badgers or some shit to get this photo. Can't you just say. I took this fantastic picture for you guys.
"3 am in the cold"

Unless it's 30 below and you're scraping ice off your windshield, I have no sympathy. Regardless, your struggle was hella worth it.
What a shitty title. Hate it when posts have unnecessary backstory trying to garner sympathy/support/upvotes. Just post it and an accurate (relevant) description and be done with it.
What camera settings do you use to achieve pictures like this?
Is that the fuzzy thing near Orion's belt? Superb picture.
We gotta get Code Talker on this before it spreads throughout the base.
Wow! Which camera did you use for this amazing photo?

So how do you take pictures of stuff like this so far away? What equipment do you need? And is it expensive? 
Unrelated question: when you say you drove 3 hours into the desert, is there roads to drive on? Are you just driving on sand? Is it legal? Sorry if these sound stupid, I've lived in the city my whole life and think it'd be cool to drive out into the desert. 
What are the pink parts? Pink stars? All those cloudy parts? Also stars?
[deleted]
If I were to look at this with the naked eye it would appear as no more than a dim star. Is that correct?
What is California desert cold?  
Signed,  curious Canadian. 
Was it with the naked eyed, or you had a telescope?
you can view it without equipment?

also, i want to observe the sky but i dont know what to buy someone can help me?
where in California did you go? I'm currently in California hanging out in the desert for a bit, I want to see this for myself
Great shot! Haha...tell me more about how cold it was in the California desert.
And if you cut another line down the middle perpendicular to the ground, that'll show you how many degrees off the equator you are!

EDIT: As has been discussed below, this is only an approximation, of course. It works best at low latitudes, over short periods of time, and when looking east/west along the direction of rotation. Outside of that if you REALLY need to know your latitude, you will have to start measuring from the pole star against the horizon instead.
I shot 186 five second exposures to cut down on light pollution interference, and managed to capture Jupiter, Mars, &amp; Venus in the frame. I stacked all the photos together to create some startrails. Then I extracted one of the photos and isolated the planets, which are neatly lined up on the ecliptic, and re-inserted it into the startrail rendering. That's when I observed the difference between the ecliptic and the rotation of the Earth are roughly 23 degrees apart, which makes sense because the path of rotation would be a right angle from the Earth's axis.
Supercool, thanks for sharing! It's difficult to actually visualize those numbers when reading about them on Wikipedia etc, so it's neat to actually see it depicted. 
Thanks for making and sharing this! I feel like this is exactly the type of thing that would make science more accessible to people
It's really strange to me, to think that we're hurtling through space at a million miles an hour, listing like a battleship taking on water.
Lot of people don't realize that this number is important.

* Earth's tilt is 23.5 degrees and is a huge factor for seasons
* At 23.5N to 23.5S, the sun's noon angle reaches 90 degrees at some point in the year
* The radius of both polar circles is 23.5 degrees. Within these circles, at some point the sun is above or below the horizon for more than 24 hours.
I always wondered how to observe that. Scientists back in the day man... I couldn't imagine seeing this and understanding what it meant, but someone made the connection through observation and experimentation.

Seriously amazing. Anyone remember offhand who it was who discovered the tilt?
Halfway through this I worried if it was one of the "100 proofs the earth is flat" things. I was pleasantly surprised.
Noob question, from a noob that always loved space annd had great curiosity in it, but never found any confirmation or otherwise to this:
Does this mean planets have all their orbits in a straight line to each other?
As in, should you even be able to form a straight line with more than 2 planets save for a few coincidences?
Thanks for posting. Always nice validating scientific theories on your own.
Very cool.  
  
And now a dumb question from a non-scientist who is currently in a debate with a flat-earther (I still am amazed that such people exist, but they do):  does this image prove that the earth is round, and if so, could you please explain it to me like I'm 5?  Much thanks. 
So two genuine questions.

1.why don't the planets have trails?

2. Do all the planets orbit on roughly the same plane? What caused this?
I'm a normal dude of normal intelligence but could you explain the significance of your photos/gif?  It does look quite beautiful.  
I'm not buying it.  I've seen some things on the History channel that call all this into question.
How far do Mars, Jupiter, and Venus deviate from the ecliptic? 
Whats the coolest is you spent the time to check your evidence and verified the veracity of our knowledge.
Complete noob here but have been intrigued by Astronomy lately and trying to learn it slowly on my own by reading here and there. Am I correct with my understanding that throughout the night the planets appear to follow the same path as the stars (rise in the east, set in the west) due to the Earth's rotation? However, night to night, little by little if viewed at the same time each night the planets will go along the ecliptic path? Is that correct?
You're honestly not that good at geometry. I've taken all sorts of advanced math classes. 
Please ELIF:

The star trails in the picture are curved and also the line that represents the alleged direction of the earths rotation does not line up parallel to the trails (to my eye, it's quite a bit off).

So how does this picture actually demonstrate what it is supposed to?

Thanks!
Can we all just take a moment to point how absolutely beautiful this is?
How far do Mars, Jupiter, and Venus deviate from the ecliptic? 
I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time visualizing why Jupiter, Mars &amp; Venus viewed from Earth would form a line on the ecliptic?  Is it just because they happen to be on roughly the same plane as Earth's rotation around the Sun?  Like if Pluto was in there, which isn't on the same plane, it would mess it all up? (typical Pluto)

How far do Mars, Jupiter, and Venus deviate from the ecliptic? 
Actually quite insightful. I never questioned how we knew we had a 23 degree tilt. It's good to see it so plainly explained.
Anyone else think watching science in action is like, the coolest thing ever?
Can someone explain why Venus is visible? If the planet's between the Earth and the Sun, how can we see it "following" Mars and Jupiter? Or are the latter just really far ahead along their orbit? In which case, they're *that* bright?
I clicked on it and the first image was just stars and I'm thinking "ok so you have star trails from a long exposure, what the fuck does this have to do with anythingOHHHHHHH ITS A GIF NEAT"
I already knew the Earth's axis rotation was 23.5°. This just made it *really fucking cool.*
The slide that says "Path of Rotation" would make a fucking awesome album cover.
Since you made frontpage and got quite a few relatively clueless people like me reading your post: You just illustrated wonderfully the difference between a layman watching and a scientist observing.

I would have watched pretty lights in the sky. You observed scientific information that verified the tilt of a whole planet's axis from the exact same thing.
Could someone from history have looked up at the sky and noticed those angles to come to conclusions about our world and the universe?

Maybe this is dumb. But is that what Galileo and the like did?
The slide that says "Path of Rotation" would make a fucking awesome album cover.
I still can't comprehend how these two objects make a DENT IN SPACE that makes them stick together across that distance.  

Edit: Wow. Everyone explaining gravity to me. I do understand gravity thank you. It just boggles the mind a bit when it's seen in context.
Zoomed right into earth and tried to pan out to the moon blind. I died in space.
An imposing combination of awe inspiring and depressing at once.

Fuck.

8 million km. If you travelled that far every minute, it is still a decade to reach Alpha Centuri.
Humans traveled that distance from Earth to the Moon...it's mind blowing to think about when you actually get a chance to see visually how big that distance is. 
This feels like another picture that suits [Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl5dlbCh8lY). 
There is something ominous and lonely about looking from this point of view...
This is the reason why the Apollo missions were badass. A species of Earth left their home planet and went to the fucking moon
Dumb question- how come, in pictures of the Earth like this, we don't see stars in the background...?
Are there any photos like this that have a perspective that shows the sun and earth? I've searched and found lots of computer generated images but not photos like this.  Would the sun's light wash out the earth?
Source: http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2015/11191545-akatsuki-and-procyon-updates.html
Is the distance between them correct? Or more accurate: were both Earth and Moon more or less the same distance away (relative to moons orbit height) or did we lost some apparent distance between them to hte third dimension?
This picture creeps me out for some reason. Mind fuck is probably the appropriate way to put it.
are both of them equidistant from the probe? If so, the scale would be correct
Funny to think that on the Earth there are billions of humans (and even more billions of other living things) moving in all direction in the picture, but on the other one, the moon, there is nothing, no movement.
This is a really cool shot.

I'm somewhat surprised at the lack of quality of the photo, though. It was launched in 2014, why the lack of resolution? Is it because it's main camera is a lyman-alpha camera?
I had to clean my phone screen to find the moon. I'm a disgusting individual. 
This is my now the background on my work computer.  Whenever the everyday stress and bullshit start to get to me I'll look at this picture and remind myself that my problems aren't that important.
I put my cursor over the earth, and then slowly moved it toward the moon, pretending that I was looking through the eyes of the first moon-bound astronauts. I immediately began to get anxious, remembering how far from home I have felt at different stages in my life; riding my bike to the park for the first time, driving to another neighborhood to see a friend, moving away and living on my own. And to be on a rocket, propelling further and further from home, so disconnected, no ground to catch you, surrounded by a habitat that will kill you. So exposed. 

I had to catch my breath and pull myself back into my computer chair.

Such a powerful photo.
We are just an insignificant, barely visible grain of sand in a desert as vast as my lack of imagination (that is pretty damned big).  Suddenly my slow internet and the dandelions popping up in my garden aren't such a big deal.  Wonder why that is...
This really puts into perspective the great distance of earth and the moon.
I waited for this image to 'load' for way too long...I'm my defence the sun was in my eyes
Probably a dumb question: Is this zoomed in a whole lot? Would the Earth and moon be visible to the naked eye at that distance?
You get a sense of the fragility of the whole little system there - like one nudge and it would break apart. 
Well, there goes my mind. Anyone got a un-blown mind spare?

How on earth did we travel that distance in the 60s?
Just because I'm ignorant - why aren't their stars in this picture? There was another one from Saturn that also had no stars in the picture.
Is this a composite photo? They look a LOT closer than I thought they would be.
How lucky are we as human beings living on Earth, also think how small are against Saturn or even the sun.
I thought there was a piece of dust on my screen. Didn't notice the picture had loaded already 
Man, it's great to understand the distance between Earth and the moon. 





Crazy how far apart they are. This is [an awesome video](https://vimeo.com/139407849) showing the scale of our solar system, mind blowing
I very much enjoy learning about space and all, but I can't help giggling about this just being two dots lol.
Every time i see pics like this i think of it from perspective of astronaut un-tethered drifting off in space.

I don't know what would be worse in that scenario...know you are going to die, or how you are going to die.  Just for a minute think of this..if they made a self contained suit that replenished oxygen, used urine filtered in suit for water into mouth...you would be drinking yourself..do death.   After you stop peeing, you starve to death in space.   On man that would be terrible.
Cool shot...really illustrates how dark the whole Moon is.....it is dark grey like asphalt or charcoal.
Man, it's great to understand the distance between Earth and the moon. 





Very rarely do I ever get a true sense for how far away the moon really is. This is one of those times.
As a puppy, my dog loved being chased by the larger dogs. Her name is Procyon.
I find it interesting thinking about the Apollo 13 astronauts when I look at this photo–the drama that played out in that distance.

What I do not understand is how the colors are so vivid from such a far distance through the atmosphere...
Just goes to show you how small we really are... I love things like this.  It puts things into perspective....
The physics student in me wishes the title would say 8 Gm instead of 8,000,000 km
Wow! When I see this I would think that the moon would be much smaller in the sky! 
Someone please photoshop all the planets of the solar system between the earth and the moon, I still can't believe what I learnt on reddit (that they would all fit in that space)
If the Moon and Earth were stationary, at what distance (from the Moon) would an object be pulled in by Earth opposed to falling back to the moon? Or in other words, what is the gravitational midpoint? 

*edit: It would be cool to know the answer, but better to see the process of solving the problem and the answer.*

*edit 2: possibly when both bodies F=ma are zero?*
Probably a dumb question: Is this zoomed in a whole lot? Would the Earth and moon be visible to the naked eye at that distance?
Probably not that but it was an episode of the first time, driving to another neighborhood to see often.
Dumb question...is the Moon on an angle to the Earths N/S poles or is it just straight out to the side?
If you could see stars in your eyes in combination with the speed of light.
As vast and incomprehensible as the size of the person on this ship its only 9.
great post you can get an idea of how far the moon is from the earth with the naked eye, scary to imagine being an astronaut leaving earth to live on say mars, very scary view!
Whats that other planet in the far right hand corner? Is it a star? [edit] - it was a crumb on my screen sorry guys,
It's hard to believe all the other planets can fit inside that gap between the Earth and the Moon! 😨
Can someone explain to me how the ISS is able to move around the earth in 2 hours ( I believe) but it takes days to reach the moon? Do we have to fly slowly in order to not "miss" the moon or get slingshotted into the void?
I can't comprehend that we can fit all planets in between the 2 and still have some space left. 
ridiculously disoriented.   

Which direction is the probe headed from earth? Where is the sun in relation to this picture, and what is the moon's orbit around earth?  
So if gravity warps space like fabric (like the videos show) then how do we have objects that orbit at different planes? (like vertically orbiting the sun from our perspective)  Wouldn't that imply that the fabric isn't flat and that it exists at all planes?
Gamma ray burst hits your side of the earth and you are gone before you've even realized it. Yes, space is terrifying.
I'm always amazed at just how far away the moon really is.
Is there an original source. I want to email it to my teacher. Reddit is blocked on my schools wifi. 
Can someone Photoshop all the solar system planets in between with realistic sizes?
Isn't it a fact that all the planets can fit between the earth and the moon? I'm sorry, but I just can't see how they could all fit between there. Can someone explain if this is a perception issue or a made up fact?
Fragile motes of dust in the void. 

All of our differences, all of our wars - over faith, politics, ethnicity and origin  - are so profoundly petty when seen from this vantage. 

I maintain hope, but images like this of *us* make me want to cry for humanity.
I always read Japanese POPCORN when I stumble on this article in my frontpage
I had to clean my screen to make sure the mom wasn't just a smudge 
Anybody know the distance from earth to the moon? How long does it take for us to travel there?
Maybe I'm blind or stupid, but where is the Earth in this image?  All I can see is the moon (I think).
They're both closer together and further apart than I thought they'd be.  
There was another one from Saturn that also had no stars in the universe, we are the universe trying to convey is that I was looking through the eyes of the moon, gives ~231km/pixel.
It looks like We are not bigger than a star. It makes me feel so small
Whenever I see pictures like this, my worries all vanish and I realize that nothing is too serious.
This is exactly how I feel when I go to the pub and realize "feck! I forgot me wallet at the gaff!"
Way to make me feel insignificant, Jerk space telescope.  Space is terrifying. 
Thats very hires on the earth for being so far away. You can see clouds.
I have to look back at Big Bang Theory recordings to understand all or just a little bit of that.
Looks pretty much like i have shot a picture of the moon.
In the image, the diameter of the earth is ~45 pixels. Using the (avg) diameter of earth gives ~283km/pixel.

The diameter of the moon is ~14px. Using the 3475km size of the moon, gives ~231km/pixel.

The distance between the moon is  the distance between the earth and the moon is ~850 pixels in the image.  The avg distance of the earth to the moon (according to wolfram alpha) is 385000km, giving 452km/px.   

The CLOSEST the moon gets to the earth is 363,104km (says google), which gives 427km/px

if the moon or the earth is closer to the camera in this image, wouldn't one of the km/px values calculated from the diameters be higher for either the moon or earth?

So It looks like the moon and earth have been moved closer in the image.
We never get a decent shot of earth from NASA. The truth is out there.
That must be at an angle. All the other planets are supposed to fit in the gap between them
Procyon probe? I definitely would have sent a probe to Alpha Centauri or Epsilon Eridani first.
You get a sense of the fragility of the whole little system there - like one nudge and it would break apart. 
anyone hyped up for the launch of James Webb telescope? i know its a bit left but i'm really hyped for all the images that will be taken
"Silvia, do you realize just how tedious it is to polish a 2.4m diameter mirror to the level needed for this project?  Because I swear, if you touch it, you're going to learn really fucking fast."
I helped make those!  The hexagonal panels, as well as several other joints in the frame, are beryllium. They were formed as near net-shape billets, provided by a third party supplier.
I've been waiting for this to be deployed since my Astronomy class...in 2010.
How fucking amazing is it that we can take a small mirror of 6.5m and see things billions of light years away!?!

Seriously... 6.5m... Not "planet sized mirror"... 6.5m.

Wtf.
Just to set expectations here, remember JWST looks mostly in infrared.  That's what's really exciting about it.  Hubble is mostly in the optical range with a bit of infrared.

Hubble is looking at mostly much shorter frequency ranges so its angular resolution is very good.  Even at several times Hubble's size, JWST won't necessarily see "better" than hubble, it will be looking at much longer wavelengths so its angular resolution with actually be quite similar or even a bit worse.  

But that's not really the point.  The point is that we can see infrared much much much much much better from space.  This is what you want from a space-based observatory.  Something you simply cannot replicate on the ground.

In fairness to Hubble, it was really not possible to replicate what it can do on the ground when it was designed.  The crazy shit we've come up with to get around atmospheric distortions are pretty incredible.

But even with its small mirror hubble is very capable both because of the extremely high quality of the optics (yes the mirror was flawed, but only because it was ground to the incorrect specifications, not because it was not made nearly perfectly) and because it's in space and has no atmosphere to contend with

JWST is often billed as a successor to Hubble, and it is in a way and I'm sure it will produce some amazing pictures, but they will be in a completely different spectrum than our eyes can normally see.
Another stupid question here:

Why can't we just build a really huge mirror that's like 20m across? Wouldn't that create even more detailed images?

Okay, I'm gonna ask the shitty question: what's Plan B if this thing doesn't make it to orbit and gets operational?
I am a piano teacher and my adult piano student designed the mirrors on the James Webb! I was so proud when he shared this with me.  I shared the news with my younger student(13) who is a science enthusiast and he said "Wow really?! Tell him congratulations and that I said hi!" 
This JWST is more or less the largest possible spaced based telescope we can build at this day in age, until we have the capability to start assembling space-based telescopes IN space that is.
I saw one of the mirrors get made, its super cool. Its made of beryllium and gold I think. But theres one question about the design that I have. Since the mirror is out in the open in space, how will space dust effect it?  
Since the mirrors are of an hexagonal shape, does that mean that it is easier to assemble multiple images taken from the same region just like Hubble did with the [Deep Field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_Deep_Field)?

Edit: Or is it just the geometry of the camera that matters?
At night sometimes I wonder and imagine the idea of the whole world investing their war, defense, weapons budgets into NASA or space in general
This telescope sounds amazing but it's not going to give pretty visible light images like the Hubble right?  Is that a good move if it's being branded the "Hubble replacement"?  Wont the general pubic be disappointed?
Wow nice, this is a much bigger upgrade than the upgrade from Silvia to Hubble!
They better not fuck anything up...I've been waiting years for this.Deployment is going to be scary.
We have a ground-based Hubble here.  As in, we have a mirror that was incorrectly made for the Hubble running one of our ground telescopes.  The first few mirrors were made wrong, because they made them with atmospheric corrections in mind.  We have them.  It's great.
We got to go inside the clean room where they're assembling it. ;)
Here's a little exclusive tour I got awhile back. http://imgur.com/a/ZFrS3

It was a Friday so we didn't see anybody working on it in the bunny suits but seeing the gold plated mirrors here don't do them enough justice. 

Our tour guide was Scott Lambros, he's such a cool dude. :) 
Let's hope they don't have to go out there and fix the mirror like with hubble. 
Someone tell her to kindly take her fucking hand off of that mirror.
Do the hexagonal mirrors act together as one super mirror, with a level of detail comparable to a single lens that size? Or is it more of a composite, parallel imaging thing? 
Is there any simulation of what kind of images we can expect? What are some of the first areas that they plan to target?

To give you guys an idea how huge Hubble is:

Here is a shot I took of a true to scale replica in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum. The thing is freaking massive.  http://i.imgur.com/iZY0LVK.jpg 
Can you say DAAA-YUUM, Silvia looks like she's up for a real good time...
Anytime I hear about this telescope, my brain automatically substitutes the name James Webb for James Woods and I experience a very brief feeling of the surreal.
Who is Sylvia and why is she touching such a accuracy vital mirror?
So a few months ago a bunch of big astronomers released a long document forecasting the future and highlighting what's needed beyond James Webb. They are making the case for a "HDST" which is a 12 meter diameter space telescope. They argue that with it we will statistically be able to identify alien life and without it the statistics and certainty are against us. 
How much more can this "see" compared to Hubble?
The problem with the JWST compared to the Hubble is it will be at one of the lirange points millions of kilometers out. Meaning if everything doesn't go perfectly and say stuff doesn't unfolded properly or is calibrated then we basically sent out the most expensive piece of space art. 
I don't get why we don't have an orbital manufacturing platform by now. We have the technology,  resources and drive to do so. The things we would know about the universe at this point If people had more ambition. 
Do the hexagonal mirrors act together as one super mirror, with a level of detail comparable to a single lens that size? Or is it more of a composite, parallel imaging thing? 
I'm so used to gifs about *look how much bigger this star is than that star* that this "space gif" was underwhelming... but I still appreciate what you're saying. *This thing accomplished so much, and now look at this bigger and better version of it*. 
I don't understand the practical implications of the massive size increase of the mirror, but I'm pumped to see more detail and have lots more objects in space discovered! In the words of Randy Marsh, "so cool".
And offers room for larger instruments to be parlayed in to space.
How does Hubble always point at the same point in space when observing? I assume it orbits the earth and makes passes pretty frequently, so I don't understand when they say Hubble was focused on an empty part of space. Capturing the ultra-Deep Image, for instance. 
Seems to me orbit would make this difficult.
Let's hope they don't have to go out there and fix the mirror like with hubble. 
But how will we repair it if something goes wrong?!?
As someone who operates our earthly 6.5m telescope it's quite large.
The JWST YouTube channel posted a '[Ready for Mirror Assembly](https://youtu.be/kNt-YTX4FEo)' video on Nov 21. [1:22]

*It's hard to adequately express our excitement at beginning the assembly of the James Webb Space Telescope's mirror. But I think this video will give you an idea. There is big stuff happening in the cleanroom this afternoon, as we begin this process. You can watch on our "Webbcam" - the biggest views are linked from this page: http://jwst.nasa.gov/webcamMax.html (though the front page of our site always has the Webbcams embeded). Enjoy!*
This, and Hubble is in Low Earth orbit. James Webb is going to be at Earth's L2 Orbit. It's hard to imagine how much better the images are going to be. Pretty exciting stuff.
Now imagine a 30m telescope.

That's what is being designed as we speak.
Is there one comparing all these with that one that looks like a flower?
Would someone care to explain to someone without any knowledge of astronomy how different the level of awesome between those two telescopes are?

Is it like 'we can get a 10x better resolution", or is it more like "see this blurry, dark-ish dot infront of this star here on this photo made by the old telescope? That's actually a planet of said stay, and here's a sharp, 20kx20k image from the newer one."
Here's a [nice comparison of telescope mirrors](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Comparison_optical_telescope_primary_mirrors.svg/2000px-Comparison_optical_telescope_primary_mirrors.svg.png) including all the large ground-based ones, some of the telescopes planned for the next 10 years are absolutely huge...
I'd rather have Silvia, although she may be getting up there in age
Could you not retrofit this and add more mirrors as time goes by?
Two days ago, they mounted the first mirror. The full mirror is set to be completed early 2016
Just imagine all the things hubble showed us that nobody expected. This guy will probably do the same. The questions we want answers to are nice and good, but I'm excited for the things we don't even know enough to ask yet, and the unknown questions this thing raises.
Serious question, how are these secured onto the frame?  I mean there's no NASA due with a power drill, right?
I was waiting for "Your mum's mirror" to pop up. Internet ruined me.
I just toured the Marshall Space Flight Center with a friend who works there. We got to see the vacuum chamber there they did a lot of testing on the James web mirrors. It was a massive massive chamber but they could only fit a small section of it in at a time
It's beryllium because it can become impractical really fast.
Nothing like science to give me chills. Fucking love technological progress.
And now compare it to the Overwhelmingly Large Telescope. Oh, I forgot, that was cancelled =(
How much better will this new one be compared to the hubble?
I love this photo.

http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2467.html
Another amazing thing: 
While the orbit of  hubble is around 570km from earth's surface, James Webbs one is 1.5 Million km! So james Webb is actually orbiting around the sun (and not the earth)!
Surely, we could build larger than this, right?  What's stopping us?
Gosh, whatever the fuck would we do without this helpful animation to explain the difference between 1.75 and 6.5.
Incorrect. That's Sylvia standing next to the Steven Segal filmography special release. 
I have mixed feelings about the James Webb telescope.

It's awesome, amazing, inspiring. It'll bring us fantastic pictures for years to come.

Okay, but, the Hubble telescope is 2.4 meters and was launched in 1990....... it took us 25 years to launch another telescope and it's only 6.5 meters?

So it took us shy of 3 decades to add 4 meters to our telescope. I feel like we aren't living up to our potential here.
Webb mirror too small. We need a bigger one. How the hell do we expect to see aliens without a bigger mirror?? Maybe the size of a football field will do. 
All this work and we'll still not be able to prove the existence of space vampires.  Great.
I am a huge fan  of this project and am ecstatic that we were ale to save it from being canceled.

That said, I  just don't think today's NASA is going to pull this off.  I hope I'm wrong, but I just see this failing ...

... big time.
I can't be the only one who was waiting for my mom to show up can I?
I like that the new telescope looks like something out of a TARDIS.
Let's hope they don't have to go out there and fix the mirror like with hubble. 
For some reason I was expecting it to zoom out again and have a mirror the size of the sun.
I can't see the Hubble Mirror properly because Silvia is in the way.
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG1noHXNo2o)'s a big taller
I will believe it when its actually launched. James Webb was suppose to launch in 2014 and now its changed to 2018 :/ I hope politicians don't try and cut the funding again on this technological achievement. The images that James Webb could capture might just inspire the future as corny as that sounds.
[Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah . . .](http://youtu.be/yDZK6H3d5bk)
I usually love the popular images that get posted here. I don't this. Why should I care?
I take it those fold out, because that would mean the rocket is even bigger
My draft for a new mirror would have it so large you could use it to walk onto the planets.
[deleted]
Slightly dissapointed. I was expecting for them to zoom out a THIRD time and have a mirror the size of a fucking building.
There was a telescope crop circle in chilbolton observatory. It looked a bit like this.
This is just wrong, you can clearly see that the objects are not to scale. How come this has so much points?
This Instagram from NASA answers exactly that: https://www.instagram.com/p/6k4pUMFbys/.
Take a selfie with your left hand holding the phone, right arm down.  Now take another selfie with your right hand holding the phone, left arm down.  Now merge the images so that your arms are both down, and you'll have the same effect, a selfie where you don't appear to be holding the camera.  

(Not exactly the same as how Curiosity does it, but close enough to explain the process.)
It is a combination of several images merged into one cohesive image. That is why you dont see the arm extended out with the camera.
Heres a video from JPL of the motions curiosity goes through to take a selfie. 
http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/video/details.php?id=1171

And here is a link to one of the comp'd images before cropping.

For example: This ["mirror selfie"](http://imgur.com/ZN82GxY) I took using the same technique
Man its wheels just keep getting worse and worse. I wonder how much longer Curiosity has until one of those wheels goes caput? It definitely has outlived its estimated failure date.
[Source with picture description](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/details.php?id=PIA19142)
It's actually pretty easy. You just have one of the camera guys in the studio take it.
Almost all rover photos (particularly the wide angle ones) are multiple small images stitched into panoramas.  Therefore they never show the arm of the camera taking the photo because it moves around between each shot.
It's a composite image. They take two or more images from a variety of angles, then stitch together all the pieces that *don't* show the camera boom in the shot.
It has a selfie stick that stitches together multiple pictures to remove the arm from the final result. In a way the arm is photoshopped out but the result is not fake in any way. It's just derived from the fact that you have multiple shots in multiple angles so you can effectively have layers that you can manipulate.

For example put your finger right in front of your left eye and focus on it. Your left eye never sees what's behind it but the right eye does. Therefore you can combine the data and remove your finger from the resulting picture entirely.
NASA has some serious selfie sticks. Who said the space program was a waste of money. 


*"The view does not include the rover's robotic arm. Wrist motions and turret rotations on the arm allowed MAHLI to acquire the mosaic's component images. The arm was positioned out of the shot in the images, or portions of images, that were used in this mosaic."*

something like this probably

It really blows my mind to think these pictures are from another planet, also just wondered if everybody looks for signs of life when they see these pictures
uses the chrome of a ufo or just asks the alien to hold the camera for a sec
If I remember right it's a bunch of images taken that have been stitched together to make the image you see
something like this probably

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iK7vRYeY3U#t=0m46s
Also sometimes they edit out the long ass arm taking the photo combined with multiple photos. 
It really blows my mind thinking that this is far more images than two, but you get the idea.
It blows my mind thinking that this little robot made on earth is chilling out there on another rock. 
You just have someone from NASA walk into the sound stage and take a picture.
Why does he low key look like he's about to drop Mars' hottest mixtape of 2015
Why do they bother doing a composite image like this? Wouldn't it be more in the spirit of the whole thing to just take a single picture with the selfie arm in there?
Then someone cuts and pastes together the two halves without the arm was held in two different directions.
I'm only realizing just now how much the surface of Mars looks like powdery chocolate.
They hire a photographer and have him come to the secret soundstage and take photos. Then they kill him.
Since no one is being serious, they just photoshop the arm out of it.
There are actually 2 curiosity rovers to prevent them from being lonely. This explains multiple phenomena, the rovers ability to outlast its predicted life span due to sharing the workload between the 2 rovers. It also explains how these selfies are taken, rather, normal photographs of one another

Also sometimes they edit out the long ass arm taking the photo combined with multiple photos. 
Put you finger up in front of you face, 6" or so from your nose. Look at whatever is behind your finger (the wall, your computer screen, whatever.) See how you can "see through" your finger? Same principal. Your two eyes are acting like two cameras taking two photos. When those photos are merged in your brain, your finger becomes transparent. 
I wish we had 3 legged Space Cars to drive around on Mars. I want to go to Mars. 
You can see the Shaddow of the Camera arm, They have merged Several Images.
This just made me want to see what we could do with some drone mounted cameras on Mars. That would be some epic videos!
[deleted]
I understanding the cropping of images and splicing together but think about this... The photo has a picture of the camera itself. Explain this to me.
It's probably a composite image of 2-3 selfies from different angles. 
Are these photos taken in color, or in black and white and then colorized by NASA?
I believe NASA said they did something similar to what /u/frid explain
I was really hoping that someone would do one of those things where there's another photo of this photo from another angle, and so on and so on . 
There's a setting in the camera app that allows you to use the front camera instead of the normal one. The curiosity rover found the setting
Is that one of the drill holes for a rock sample just in front of the rover? 

Destin did a video on the drill &amp; process. Pretty cool stuff. 
Im pretty sure they just edit out the arm of the rover
Recently I discovered Google's (new?) app called Street View that allows you to create spherical composite pictures ("Photospheres") with just your phone's camera, and it's awesome!  First time I took one I realized afterward that my legs/feet were not in the photo after it stitched everything together -- it surprised me.
It doesn't have the nessissary body mechanics to take merged selfie. At least I'm pretty damn sure it doesn't. 
I just love the fact that technology's finally gotten so advanced that Curiosity actually looks like something one would find for sale in some Jawa's sandcrawler on Tatooine. 
I made a few timelapses over the weekend, and I thought /r/space would appreciate the timelapse of the night sky with the Large Magellanic Cloud in view! [The full video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P1aycRHcQk)

Equipment was a Canon 600D with a Samyang 16mm f2.0 lens. Each shot was 25 seconds long, taken one after another.
How on earth did you get the stars with the bright lights from the house on the left?
What jellyfish?  I was expecting something like Encounter at Farpoint here. o.o
I think some wizards show up and try to avada kadavra each other in your gif.
I don't want to alarm you, but I think somebody you know might have [mutant powers](http://i.imgur.com/v0FK77F.jpg).
I love the lighting and how the green dashes flash in the sky.  What would that green be anyways?
Where can I go to see such stars, I live in Phoenix Arizona, and I only know Light Pollution.


Now can somebody stabilize this gif to the night sky?
Question - how do you get the actual shot to move / pan?  Are you physically moving the camera or is it something you add / edit in post-production?  I think I saw that these were continuous 25-second shots so I'm not sure how you could physically move the camera without affecting the quality.
Did anyone else notice that one "airplane" stop and pause for a moment about 70% into the .gif while the stars kept moving?

It's weird how there are so many shooting stars in just  one night yet I can count on one hand the number I have seen over my entire life time.
Can someone stabilize the sky in that so we see the Earth move instead? I kinda want to see that now...
I get off work around 1am during the week. And every night the first thing I do is look up at the night sky. I work in the sticks and it is amazing seeing the Milky Way and so many stars that the night is bright. Very nice timelapse OP. I just love space and science in general.
Hey OP and you in south america or NZ or Australia? I dont recognize these star patterns?
wow this is fantastic, i could watch this for hours!
Very nice work! Please consider xposting this to r/timelapsegifs. I think the light clouds passing by actually enhance the final product by giving another sense of the time scale.
This is why I want to go to the Southern Hemisphere.
Nothing reminds me more that we are just specks on a large rock floating through space then a time lapse facing the stars. 
I saw a couple lasers, did you inadvertently film your neighbors engaging in a space battle?
I'm not sure if this a comment on human nature but I ended up looking out for the people by the house more than the stars
How on earth did you get the stars with the bright lights from the house on the left?
I love how the people in the house just randomly starts shooting green lasers at the sky in the middle of the night.

Oh wow. I'd love to live somewhere where the sky looks like that. I didn't realize how much light pollution actually affects my view 
Darn, if i dim all the lights in the neighborhood i would not come close to that night quality ! 
I feel so small looking at timelapses of the night sky.
Hey Mcflymoose, do you perhaps know of any cheap equipment that would enable me to either see the stars, take pictures of them, or video tape them?
Why does the camera appear to creep upwards in relation to the house? Shouldn't it be steady? 
I watched this 5 times and still did not know where the jellyfish is. help
I didnt realize how often shooting stars occur before seeing this.  Ive only witnessed 2 shooting starts in my whole 19 years of life and you just captured numerous shooting stars in one night


Whats with the tree moving toward the beginning of the gif
I actually feel like I'm the thing moving and space isn't.  Very well done.  Hard to feel the actual effect of reality from our little rock. 
Wow, never realized the sheer volume of shooting stars in a fixed portion of the sky, in a single night nonetheless.  Was this taken during a meteor shower or a period of unusually high activity?  
How is the camera able to pick-up and record all these stars if there is a huge amount of light coming out of that house?
Not even a second when that gif starts, it looks like something big and white falls from the sky in your yard off to the right. 
Looks like you live in British Colombia. 
Absolutely gorgeous shots. Reminds me how beautiful life can be.
Two questions; how high is your ISO? How long is this time lapse overall?


i don't see polaris and the field is rotating clockwise.  south america?

I can understand why they thought the rest of the universe moved around us... Every time I see these time-lapses, I forget for a split second that the Earth is rotating not the other way around....
Where was this time-lapse taken? So clear. 
Are the occasional streaks aircraft flying by? I was thinking they might be meteor streaks but then realized it's unlikely with a time lapse.
I wish  my neighborhood was nice enough  that I could leave a camera  outside  all night.
Anyone have the timelapse shot that stabilises the stars and shows the earth rotate? Want to show someone.
Is there anyway to make it so the sky is held still and the earth and clouds rotate to give us an idea of the earths rotation?
Wow, never realized the sheer volume of shooting stars in a fixed portion of the sky, in a single night nonetheless.  Was this taken during a meteor shower or a period of unusually high activity?  
Are those so called shooting stars? Didnt know its so many of them during a night. 
this is one of the timelapses that give me the most the impression of being on a moving object. 
Amazing and incredibly humbling, we're just spinning and spinning.
Are those stars really that big or is it the the exposure making them look so large and glowing? If they are really that big, either they are not that far, or they are super far but super large? Can someone shed some light on this?
Looks fantastic - lucky you can see such a clear sky from your place :)
It blows my mind how many meteorites there are coming through our atmosphere all day. You never notice during the day and at night you're inside or just not paying attention. 
Why is your camera moving? 
This is so beautiful, I'm glad you shared this :D
This gave me vertigo.

Why did it give me vertigo?
Why did you keep the house lights on?

Question: i live in northern california, is it possible for me to get an exposure shot of andromeda from my backyard? 
Probably a dumb question but Are there places on earth where this view is able to be seen from the naked eye? I have never seen a sky like this anywhere. 
How do you get such a clear view of the stars with the light from the house so close?
Is this what a night sky looks like when not living in a city? God damn am I missing out.
Make sure not to shine that laser into your camera. It will fry your sensor. Trust me I know from experience. 
The night sky lies so sprent with stars that there is scarcely space of black at all and they fall all night in bitter arcs and it is so that their numbers are no less.
Wish would would turn off the lights, and see this nightly. Our "world" would be a different place.
Its like we're being held in a glittery gel product.  I understood it once, when I ate
 mushrooms.   
How are you able to get such amazing view of the stars with light pollution around u?
Do you really see that many stars in the sky where you live?
This beautifully captures our place in the universe. This is so awe inspiring. I don't think I've ever really visually seen the rest of our galaxy so... plainly before. This really drives home the point that we're just a tiny rock floating around with billions of others.
Ooof... Suddenly I feel so insignificant watching the earth move like that.
How on earth did you get the stars with the bright lights from the house on the left?
I try stargazing sometimes at my house. I get to see the moon and a couple stars...and you get to see this!
Jealous right now...
I'm 15 and live in new York. I've never looked up and seen that many stars in my life. Usually seen only about 50 - 100. Damn light pollution!
One of the few truthful titles! I usually see a "My Andromeda shot with only my iPhone" only to find they used $5000 of equipment along with it. 

This is really cool to see what can be achieved with simply a DSLR and a lens. Thanks!

How did you manage to get 400 exposures of it manually with a 200mm?
I know you were combining images, but still, how did you get a picture like that in Ottawa? The light pollution is pretty bad here.
I never expected to see another Ottawan on this subreddit! Beautiful photo!

May I ask where this photo was taken?
When you realise that in that in that galaxy, 2.537 million light years away, there could be the most amazing things we have never even dreamed of. There could be civilisations of all proportions and there could be the most beautiful sights you have ever seen. And when you realise there are hundreds of billions of galaxies just like that one. You really do feel small. Great photo.
Very nice. Congratulations. A little more detail about the shoot would be great though.
Thanks for the post.  It's great learning this technique.  Did you use an app to know where to point in the sky?   My only attempts at astrophotography is for meteors, but that's shooting 11mm @2.8, so the othe side of the spectrum. 
Anyone know what they second galaxy in the picture is?
Awesome.... Pretty impressing considering your equipment. 👍
It's pretty cool how you can see the layer of stars over the galaxy, it gives a nice feeling of depth
Wow, are you on the outskirts of Ottawa? I live just beside Bell's Corners and I can hardly see anything in the night sky from the light pollution :/
Congrats. Great capture. Inspiring stuff to use with only dslr equipment. Going to try this next clear night. Does DSS automatically align the images for you? I'd imagine it would be a right pain to have to stack and align them yourself
How do people know where to look for all sorts of stuff? I'd love to learn
I have a stupid question. I'm quite embarrassed to ask this, but I really need to know. 

Can you actually see something like this with naked eyes in places without light pollution? Or is it largely with assistance of camera's long exposure? I'm asking this because I've never been to a place where the sky looks remotely like this at night. Seeing pictures like this and ones of milky way seems surreal to me. 
When did r/photography become r/MassEffect?

Just kidding, beautiful pic!
What if some alien in Andromeda is excited about their first photograph of our galaxy?
you found a DSLR and a 70-200mm lens in your backyard‽

I guess congratulations are in order!
Great shot! Try ISO3200 or even ISO1600. M33 is pretty bright comparatively, so it's possible to reduce some noise by dropping the ISO.
Finally! Someone taking good deep sky photos with similar kit to me.  I've tried this with my EOS 450D and a 55-250mm lens, on a motorised equatorial mount, and my "after" photos look like your "before"!  My camera only goes up to ISO 3200 though so I need to take longer exposures, which means I use a lower zoom. 

 I've always used Deep Sky Stacker- would you recommend your software over DSS?
It may be low-effort comment, but it is sincere. That is a beautiful shot.
 Hi Guys , thaugt like why not try this .
 But have a few questions :

Is it hard to set up ?

Cost price of installation ?

Is location of importance ? 

Thanks


Are all the other stars in the milky way? Crazy to think of the distances involved.
Would something like this be possible with a D3200? I've only ever done little bits of astrophotography myself, so achieving this would honestly blow my mind. If so, what exactly are the steps, bar the exposure etc.
what settings did you use? shutter? ISO? AP? I want to start doing this and I will have a DSLR t5 with a 75-300mm lens soon
Great shot! Try ISO3200 or even ISO1600. M33 is pretty bright comparatively, so it's possible to reduce some noise by dropping the ISO.
Thats really awesome.  Isnt it amazing you can take a picture of another GALAXY from your backyard....It blows my freekin' mind , man.

 Also,  cheers from Orleans fellow Ottawa person!
So much out there we cannot possibly understand yet it all fits in our eye.

I think if I could ever see the heavens this clearly my life perspective would change forever. 
[This](http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/heic1502a/zoomable/) is a super high resolution picture of the galaxy. If you zoom in, you can see individual stars! It's super cool!
Hey, I've been wanting to give astrophotography a go and also live in Ottawa. Where was it dark enough to be able to take this? Experimental farm?
It will forever blow my goddamned mind that we can see another entire galaxy RIGHT THERE.  And to think there is most likely something over there (multiple somethings for that matter) looking back at us at the same time.
lol kind of embarrassing, I thought the Andromeda galaxy only existed in Star Trek. I do know it has two moons though! 
That's an amazing amount of detail for only 1.6 second exposures! 
Hey space people, what's the galaxy that appears to be below Andromeda called?
Really well done! Good first time shot of Andromeda. 
Wow noice! I always wanted to do bought photography but i could never get nice results
And my camera got stolen recently : ( so now i have to finish paying it off, and start the process over
I'm curious, which DSLR camera were you using while taking this shot? It looks great!
Congrats. Great capture. Inspiring stuff to use with only dslr equipment. Going to try this next clear night. Does DSS automatically align the images for you? I'd imagine it would be a right pain to have to stack and align them yourself
Built a barn door style tracker and been working on refining it the last few nights to get this shot. Thanks for making me realise I can just go and do it anyway whilst I'm fixing it up. Awesome first capture
I'm not saying this isn't real, but it is incredibly hard to believe you just took this in a single shot with nothing but a camera. u/TheRiceEater can you give us more information? How about exif data (aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc)? what kind of post-processing did you do? is this the result of multiple stacked images? The more information the better. I've been trying for years to get a decent shot of Andromeda and even with a telescope have never gotten this amount of color and detail. At best all I've gotten is a bright smudge which is what most people see. 

Thanks in advance. 
Wooow, I didn't know there was a galaxy that big in the sky! And yet it's still incredibly tiny...
Which galaxy is just below Andromeda? The next largest and brightest galaxy in the picture 
I'm from Ottawa and very jelly! Every time some awesome cosmic occurrence happens, it's too fucking cloudy to see shit, as was the case with the blood/supermoon D:
So I notice some stars appear blue and some red. Does any of this have to do with red shift or blue shift from stars coming at us or traveling away from us?
I've got a Sony with 50-300 mm , 
lens wonder if I can try do the same
How did you get a good photo in Ottawa? the light polution is so bad i can read a book in the woods

I'm pretty new to astrophotography so I'm probably wrong but I think you're out of focus 
Good job mate. ?have u done any sky photos before??? U have clean sky in Canada. It rains here in Ireland for last 13 months
Excellent work!  I had no idea is was possible to get shots of this quality without a tracking mount.  Thank you for sharing how you did it!
Are all those white dots in the background stars or are they galaxies? 
Ugh, okay, I have a silly question...the stars that appear "within" the boundaries of Andromeda, are they between, apart of, or behind Andromeda? I feel like a child having to ask this, I mean I know they're not behind, because its a whole galaxy of stars, so they wouldn't shine through...I guess its just more of a question of scope.
"Watcha doin' honey?"

"Oh just taking a picture of another galaxy with my phone!"

What a time we live in.
Whats that little thing under Andromeda? A close star or another galaxy faaaaaar away?
My Dad says "well done, that's impressive, and looking through binoculars doesnt work anymore".
Man I love these photos, really puts into perspective how small we are.
Amazing what can be done with a simple set up. I want to try this with my Canon 7D, a 200mm 1.8 and a German equatorial mount.
I love photos like this. It's always so mind boggling to realize how vast the universe is...all those galaxies just floating out there
That is a beautiful picture!

Every time I see a picture like this it looks unreal and makes me think. Good job :)
It's pictures like these that make me wish I lived in a place where it wasn't always cloudy so I could take pictures like this.
Oh I live in Ottawa! Where do you live that's it's dark enough to see this? It's always too bright for me to even see many starts, usually :(
Great shot dude. I live in Barrie, so its nice to see photos like this from not too far away.
How are these types of photographs taken? I know they're combined images but what's the procedure? Awesome picture though !
Woah! Super cool to see a fellow Ottawan getting some well-deserved recognition. Nice pic, dude! 
How long did it take you to layer 400 images?
I mean just opening that many files must have been a day on its own
Am I seeing another galaxy right beneath Andromeda at about 5 o'clock?  If so, does anyone know it's name and its relative distance from Earth when compared to our closest neighbor Andromeda.
Very nice. Congratulations. A little more detail about the shoot would be great though.
It's crazy to think about all the intelligent life that could be going on within that little cloud of light that's actually hundreds of thousands of light years in diameter..
Things like this tend to make me sad. Just thinking, somewhere in that blurry mass of light there's a good chance there's someone like me looking out my way thinking the same thought of "how depressing I'll never get to meet the being looking out at me right now". I'm a bit drunk, did that make sense?
This is the camera I want so seeing this being able to be done is so cool this is really inspiring that I could do something like that without tons of equipment!
Can I just say that's awesome?  Very good, I want to get into a astrophotography especially with my kids, just yet to bite the bullet.

So, Thank you.

And, Good day.
What's the name of that galaxy right behind Andromeda?
Ottawa resident, here. What neighbourhood OP because I always figured that there was always too much light pollution for views like that. That's incredible.
Can anyone explain why those "stars" or whatever they are behind the  galaxy look so much more prominent? Maybe they are actually in front of the galaxy so they look bigger?
This is amazing. How can this be done? Is there some sort of instructional video?
Could someone tell me exactly where to buy something like this? Would this scope still be able to see the planets and moons in detail aswell?
Make your next attempt with a 14" F4.0 and it will be better...
Would it work to use a p900 Nikon with a telescope? 
Is there a way to tell which of the stars are planets and which are suns (or moons)?

What does the blue color of some of the stars mean?

Is that another galaxy below Andromeda (that small blur that looks like a mini-version of Andromeda)?
Wow beautiful shot! But she was way hotter in Clash of the Titans (The original, not that remake crap (although she was hot too, but something about the original mmmm))
Were you using teleconverters? I see photos of planets etc taken with 70-200's and I can't even get a decent star shot of Jupiter when it was in the sky with my 70-200. 
Wow this is impressive. Makes me want to crack out my my 70-200 and do more night photography 
Witness Andromeda, the destroyer of our galaxy. 
Perfect job. Most people's galaxy's  don't extend beyond a city block. Thank you for that image.
Oh god I need to do this. I have that equipment!
Thank you for this image and explanation! All i have is a 200mm as well and i always wondered if it could do any cool astrophotography. I guess image stacking is the key! Thanks for inspiring me!
This is absolutely incredible. Is there some way I can follow to see more of pictures like this in the future?
It may be low-effort comment, but it is sincere. That is a beautiful shot.
Where in Ottawa are you? I can't see anything more than Orion on a clear night. 
I think it's funny that inthe US everyone has to go into the desert to get a shot without light from the cities. While in Canada you can do it from your backyard
Cool... this really gives me the impression of what fish must feel like at the pet store. Looking out at other fishtanks, from inside your own...
how many shots, did you use a reference frame, what ISO, all the regular questions
Where in Ottawa did you take this! I've been looking for a nice spot to photograph from 
In the Image I notice that the objects in the left are sharp compared to those on the right. Do you know why?
Whats that little thing under Andromeda? A close star or another galaxy faaaaaar away?
The single frame shot got me interested. I tried this before and thought what the heck. The final outcome is amazing OP, very nicely done, actually amazing! I'm going to try again, thanks for sharing the specs as well, much appreciated.
That looks suspiciously like a picture a friend of mine from Andromeda took of the Milky Way.
I have a dslr and a 200 mm lens and can't even take a picture of the moon.. :/
When looking at this, all the dots are stars that are in front of the galaxy, right? Or are some of them other galaxies?
Omg this is beautiful. We need more of this in the world. Thank you sir. How long have you been into this? 
How do you capture something like that so far away with ZERO blur of the stars?

Edit: My GF has that lens and she calls bullshit. Her words! Not mine! 
Nice shot, how could you achieve this amazing result? I'm not really into photography...
Holy shit...how much did you spend on equipment? I want a telescope now
[deleted]
I'm glad I waited long enough for the .gif to load to see it move!  Bravo OP!
Pretty good picture anyway. I mean with mediocre equipment that looks great!
Holy fuck I am so glad it's not another *I shot a pic of the moon* post. Also, well done. 
I want to point out that this image has not been validated or calibrated. A validated/calibrated image will be archived with the NASA Planetary Data System in 2016.

Something so mysterious about seeing something just hanging in space. Beautiful image. 
My daughter and I have been planning on writing a series of books called The Moon Maidens where we follow the adventures of a young maiden named Tethys who has the characteristics of this moon. She lives in the kingdom of her father Saturn with her sisters the other moon maidens and has adventures in the wider solar system. 

Meant for younger girls, the stories are meant to teach them about the characteristics of all the planetary bodies in the solar system. Like My Little Pony in space the stories can introduce children to many planets, moons, and asteroids that they may otherwise never learn about.

If anyone is an astronomer or enthusiast who can help us develop our gallery of characters based on the characteristics of various planetary bodies, we'd love to have your help.

If Saturn was inhabitable, people would just stare at the rings in their free time.
How I imagine every photographic satellite: https://i.imgur.com/nEKfIp0.jpg
If you look *real* closely, you can see Destiny's servers glitching out.
Is that Hyperion just above the rings towards the lower right of the image? 
What is the other moon in the background there?
How can anyone not just be fascinated with the fact that out there, are these giant "floating" pieces of mass, in the abyss of emptiness that is space. Blows my tiny dog mind every time I see these types of images.
I've always wondered what Saturn's rings would look like up close. They look so smooth in the images.
It is mind boggling the number of people, the amount of planning, and the man hours that go into making a shot like this.
If that's where it is in its orbit, wouldn't it have to pass threw the ring?
Saturns rings are actually bits of debris floating around it correct? This must be fairly far away for the rings to look so smooth right?
That's no moo... no sorry, my mistake.

Edit: Wait, I'm thinking of Mimas. Well this one looks pretty Death Starry too. Maybe this is the second Death Star, from Jedi. Or maybe it's the Death Egg.
This can certainly be said of the angle the picture was taken at.
How big must the rock have been   that created  the crater on the top right ?
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethys_%28moon%29

[It's a lil'moon!](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Tethys_Earth_Moon_Comparison.png)

Does anyone know how to save an image from the alien blue app? I can't long press or double press to save it
Do Saturn's rings warp with the gravity of satellites? Like tides on Earth or something similar? That would be interesting to see!
I've been using Tethys as my IGN for a few games for like, 2 years, and I've never actually seen a picture of the planet before
No. a processed image would be cool Could you theoretically stand on Saturn's rings?
I read this as [thety's](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetys_vagina) which also float, but are much weirder
Now, the question is whether we're looking at the bottom of the ring, or the top. In other words, is the edge of the ring pointing above the camera, or below it?

Go ahead and sleep on that.
Check the reply to that to see things more clearly, that couldn't be seen otherwise.
Saturn has 62 known moons, and asteroids that they may otherwise never learn about.
I read it as titeys floating above frozen rings of Saturn. They must get nippy out there all alone.
I wish I could wrap my head around how big this is. Anyone wanna take a stab at giving me a scope?
Have we ever gotten close enough to the rings to actually see the makeup of them? I'd be interested in knowing how far apart the asteroids in it might be.
It is nearly impossible to comprehend how small we really are! A tiny piece in an unending universe....
If anyone is an accurate representation of what they are doing at that particular moment.
Edit just a note that some processing is done specifically to be about 140 Kbps, so transmitting a picture like this from far away.
Could you theoretically stand on Saturn's rings? Like a rover race around them because that would be cool
Can someone tell me what the object floating above the ring in the background is?
This must be fairly far away for the first time upon entering space, as it wouldn't feel the gravity and used water going down a drain as an analogy.
Scientifically you use the processed image would be behind Saturn, with the Sun backlighting the rings to actually see the makeup of them?
Do Saturn's rings warp with the gravity of satellites? Like tides on Earth or something similar? That would be interesting to see!
No. a processed image would be cool Could you theoretically stand on Saturn's rings?
Is there a neutral buoyancy region in the ether near the rings of Saturn to allow Tethys to float?
Man, my tiny little brain cannot compute how vast Space is. When I try, it just... blocks like I can't wrap my head around it. 

Welp, better go worry about what's for lunch tonight. 
Depressing to think that our species can achieve such greatness, viewing beauty from so far away whilst so many suffer right here.
Could you theoretically stand on Saturn's rings? Like a rover race around them because that would be cool
This is not floating. To 'float" is to "move or hover slowly and lightly in a liquid or the air; drift." 
Looking in the grand scale of things Saturn is within a few light hours of Earth.
Saturn has a crap-load of moons and many of the planet before Is there a neutral buoyancy region in the solar system.
Not validated means not real. Even nasa has trouble "validating" their photos with people seeking REAL photos. They are all faked. Unless it's a moon shot from Earth even then it's pretty enhanced in today's photo world
Absolutely stunning! Could you give us some information as to what equipment you used, your exposure periods, etc. Thank you in advance! 
I hope you contacted your local authorities!

Seriously though, gorgeous picture. Makes me want to blow the dust off my telescope and try to get back into the game.
How amazing. I mean sure, we see Andromeda pics almost daily on this sub, but there is something so incredible about seeing "taken from by back yard, etc" and knowing that somewhere above our heads is galaxy millions of lightyears away, that contains other worlds, and we can somehow not only see it, but capture it, and then share it for those in our world to see. Is there life within Andromeda that's doing the same to us? And is someone else blabbering on about how other-worldly it is.

I'm not high, but it's 2:00 am. Bye.
Really nice work. You should make a YouTube video on how you did this.
At first I thought this was a joke (oh look, this guy is moking people who take pictures of stars with their phones), but then I kept reading the comments......and ohhhh myyyyy goooood this guy really took this picture. That's amazing, I didn't know this was possible. Cool job
stupid question here. Are thous "background" stars are in front of andromeda or thous are background stars/galaxys... I feel so stupid
Whoever took Andromeda from your back yard, they need to bring it back.
Andromeda is awesome. the first time i saw it with my naked eye (I was at  the summit of Mauna Kea, no less), was really mind blowing. Even at that height and darkness it was just a smudge, but to think i was able to perceive light that was coming at me from over 2 million light years away really sort of puts you in your place. 
As someone who is disillusioned with most things in life, I never get tired of pictures of space - especially ones as mesmerizing as this.  Awesome picture.
Well, I certainly hope whoever took it brings it back in a timely fashion.
Who would steal a galaxy from someone's backyard? You should call the police.


Incredible picture though!!
Please bring Andromeda back to this man's backyard. #SaveAndromeda2015

What the fuck part of Phoenix do YOU live in? I get a couple stars, helicopters, and dust in the sky at night.
Whoa I'm pretty clueless but how is a picture like this taken??? 
Theoretically, we could use this image to map out the distance and angle of those stars and then work out where you live.
not being able to see Andromeda is the most depressing thing about living in the southern hemisphere
Why can a photo can be perfectly taken to show us these marvelous scenes?
I am sorry to ask this seem like stupid question, but as a Chinese who can only saw a minuscule amount of stars, I am out of curiosity. 
The coolest to me is that even if Andromeda was rotating at 99% of the speed of light, it would still appear to be perfectly still to us, even over a lifetime.
I'm from BC. 

About 10 years ago a buddy and I drove to Phoenix to watch the drag boat races. We camped half the time we were down there. 
One thing that really stood out in my memory was the sky. 
I've never seen stars like that. 
I love Arizona, it's a beautiful state and if I was ever going to move to the states I'd like to live there. 
I live around central and indian school... I can't imagine possibly taking a picture of anything in the sky and making it look like this.  

Are you further out, or what?  Is your equipment just that good?
I have problems photographing the moon with my shitty Samsung, and am usually all "ah, fuck this"...  It's all in the equipment, and patience of the photographer.

Good job man
Awesome! Is this what it looks like with visible light or did you put it through any filters to get this?
I live in Flagstaff and frequent the Lowell Observatory. This picture surpasses anything I've seen at the observatory. Great work.  
what the actual f*ck, you actually saw this right in your backYARD?!
It's always amazing to me that when we look at photos of galaxies we're viewing billions of suns orbiting a supermassive black hole millions of years in the past. This is a great photo OP.
I don't mean to alarm anyone, but IT'S HEADED RIGHT FOR US! WE'RE GONNA COLLIDE!!!!1
Beauty definition on the dust lanes!.... I envy your skies
Hey man, just wanted to say awesome picture! I would love to see a video of your time in the desert
Maybe you should put it back OP! You know... From your backyard. Back into the sky? 
AAAAAAAA! It's going to crush into us!!!

Seriously though, great pic.
Is this actually what you can see from a telescope? Does it look like that with the colours and all through the lenses?
Is it true that all the stars around Andromeda we see in the photo are actually within our own galaxy? that possibility blows my peanut of a mind. it shows the insane scale of space, of Andromeda, and our own galaxy. 
Use of your location in the title amuses me with the vastness of space. I could easily say: 

Hey, check out my pic of Andromeda from the Mongolian steppes: https://i.imgur.com/C0XzpHI.jpg

It could be right. Not a pixel changed. Despite being thousands of miles apart.
eli5: if super-massive black holes are at the center of most galaxies, why do most galaxies appear to have a star in the center? shouldn't it be busy.. getting destroyed?
Tripping during the day I was flipping through the public channels on a tv checking out nasa... I came across a Christian based cartoon show where it contained little segments. The first full segment that I watched was something called "Androids from Andromeda" which was a poem about a little boy who had this ET/android which followed him everywhere, during sleep, play, showering. The content was very wierd especially for a Christian childrens program. 
What a beautiful shot, thank you 
I think I've seen this "back yard" photo 10 times in three months in here.
OMG! Moving to Phoenix in 56 days. Can't freaking wait!

Hey, I am new to the Phoenix area and want a night of stargazing (maybe sleep in a tent somewhere). Could you recommend anywhere? I have only ever lived in big cities so this is really awesome to me!
This looks really high quality. Do you have your own observatory?
Are each of the spots behind the Andromeda other galaxies? Or stars?
eli5: if super-massive black holes are at the center of most galaxies, why do most galaxies appear to have a star in the center? shouldn't it be busy.. getting destroyed?
Can you imagine we are on a collision course with that :-)
That is how Andromeda and Messier 32 looked close to 2.5 million years ago. Also I think it is interesting to think that long from now, an estimated 4 billion years, that both the Andromeda and Milky Way Galaxies will become one entity, probably breathing new life(star formation) into the newly formed Galaxy.
I live in Scottsdale. Any good ideas as to where I could go in order to see a clear sky?
Is it possible to see this with the naked eye?  Perhaps a stupid question, but I drove a few miles out of town a couple of weeks ago just to see some stars, and after a while in the dark things became clearer and there was a dull blur just like this, I couldn't see it directly but from the corner of my eye it was clearly there, and large.  I immediately thought of AG but I don't even think that's possible?
eli5: if super-massive black holes are at the center of most galaxies, why do most galaxies appear to have a star in the center? shouldn't it be busy.. getting destroyed?
Serious question to all the amateur astronomers here: how does one get such a wonderful picture? do you have to leave the camera on, taking lots of pictures for hours? do you compile the pictures together into one photograph? is any of this photo computer generated? how powerful of a telescope do you need to see deep space objects like galaxies and quasars? Awesome picture, I would love to know what goes into making these. 
This is impressive! Something I am also looking to do with my spare time.
Thank you for sharing. It is the background I was looking for on my Galaxy S6.
Just curious, where in Phoenix? I just moved to the Foothills in Ahwatukee and the sky is so much darker here! I'm excited to take out my scope and 70d and start trying this out. I don't know much and am trying to learn from this sub. 
This is a hell of an amazing picture for our light polluted Phoenix.  Thanks also for the MeetUp link, I am going to join and hope to go in December as I can't get to this months.
Was that the really bright ass 'star' looking thing out my window the other night? It was the only thing in the entire sky. I live in Scottsdale.
There's got to be another earth in there somewhere.

No way you're in Phoenix. I can barely see shit here in Paradise Valley :( lol. Nice shot though!
Beautiful work! Reviews I've read for those astrographs say that a coma corrector (like the paracorr) are required, but I don't see one in your equipment list. How did you manage that?
I call BS! You didn't just go out and find Andromeda in your back yard in Phoenix. 

Being serious, that is pretty cool!
Wow, that's a stunning result. Congratulations and thanks for sharing!
Can't freaking wait! come to our meet up, i posted in one of the image by taking multiple photos and laying them on top of each other!
I'd imagine most of them are stars from our galaxy, with maybe a few degrees and you'll be looking for him on the weekend closest to the new moon. but I love Arizona, it's a beautiful state and if I PM you and have a low budget Thanks for answering cost.
This looks really high quality. Do you have your own observatory?
I did not know it's possible to take such picture, without working for NASA or similar institutes.... That's awesome my friend!
Great shot! The time and effort it takes to get something like this just right is worth commending you for. Well done.
I live in New York but plan on moving to either Tucson or Phoenix. I was wondering, is there affordable way to view stuff like this? It doesn't have to be this much detail, but somewhere enough to whoa me. The night sky sort of already wows me since i don't see a lot of stars in NYC (lived there almost all my life).
Awesome pic...My new iMac has a great desktop background :)
Wow, this makes me want to move to your part of town for a few months!
Does anyone know what the bright blob below Andromeda is? I assume it's another galaxy, but which one?
Is the faint glow small stars that are out of focus or is it space dust reflecting the light of the stars around it? Or is it a combination of both?
So what's the next brightest galaxy on the right side of the picture?
This is amazing shit right here. I would love to be able to see that. I'm in awe. 


Andromeda is making a beeline for planet earth, and the collision will cause global warming, ice ages, earth quakes, floods, volcanos, and death, destruction and total mayhem. And those are just the movie depictions of it.  Wait till you see the  actual calamity.     So I don't think its funny that people tweek Andromeda's nose by taking unwarranted and unflattering photos of it, which only has the effect of making that galaxy even more angry than it already is.  So knock it off.  
What a gorgeous pic. People are crazy to think we are the only life form out there. There is so much and beyond in this, no telling what there is. 
Can you share the technical specs of this shot? Equipment, settings, tweaking, etc?
Any beginner steps you could provide? What type of lens, camera should I purchase first? What kind of methods do you use with the computer?
That's amazing and very inspiring!  Do you have any go to forums with discussions on astrophotography?
Is the faint glow small stars that are out of focus or is it space dust reflecting the light of the stars around it? Or is it a combination of both?
And to think there could be someone or something out there with the same capabilities looking at our galaxy as it would appear years ago... Crazy!!
Beautiful shot. In relation to the photo, how does Andromeda look when observing through this particular model telescope?
So many lights in Phoenix AZ you can barely see the starts.  I don't buy into this one.  I also live in Phoenix. Over 5 million people.

This is one of the first pics where I feel like I can see the depth and where this galaxy is in relation to the other light behind it. You can almost see it blow out into this giant circle. Pretty damn cool.
Nice picture. I have question, how is it when we look up at the milky way we can't see our own galactic center ( on visible spectrum)  but when we look at another  galaxy (like this picture) we can see its entirety?
this is amazing.  seriously amazing,

how do you even go about taking something this, do you need to live in an area with low light pollution?

love it
I'm having a good night if I can see the stars at all. Gotta love the Chicago area. Nothing says fun like light pollution...

[More pictures of Daphnis](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/Cassini-Huygens?order=Xdim*Ydim*Zdim&amp;sort=DESC&amp;subselect=Target:Daphnis:)
Does any one know where we can find a profile oriented image of the structures?
For people curious how the rings and moon make these waves: 
The ring particles and Daphnis are at orbital velocity, which is faster when closer in to Saturn.  So Daphnis is moving past the outer ring, and the inner ring is moving past Daphnis.  Everything is moving downwards in the photo.  At the bottom of the photo, the inner ring has waves of distortion from flying by the moon (outer ring is nice and sharp).  At the top of the photo, the outer ring is distorted because Daphnis flew by at a faster speed.  The differences are more obvious in [this photo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeler_Gap#/media/File%3APIA08319_Daphnis_in_Keeler_Gap.jpg).

The waves themselves are caused because Daphnis formed slightly asymmetrically, so it is inclined very slightly to the plane of the rings.  This means that the moon's gravitational center is often above or below the rings, and the rings move out of their plane toward it as it passes.
I did a painting of this:  Daphnis at Saturn:  Gravity waves in the Keeler Gap.    It's now hanging in the main Cassini  conference room at JPL.   http://imgur.com/jpiH5RU    Dr John W Weiss, one of the lead investigators on Daphnis,  gave me a lot of guidance.   The painting was also published in Aviation Week a few years ago.
If listening to [The Message](http://themessagepodcast.com) this week has taught me anything, it's that you *should not listen* to sounds from outer space...
The shadows look like radio waves or a heart beat monitor, pretty neat!
Are these the waves you could "surf" Kim Stanley Robinson wrote about in 2312?
Doesn't the moon move at the same speed and in the same direction as the particles in the rings? How come it's making a path and waves on the side then? Shouldn't it instead create a hole around itself from where the ring particles have been caught in its field of gravity?

That is a crazy image.
It's hard for me to grasp the scope of it because it doesnt look like a bunch of tiny asteroids(?). It looks like a flat surface. 
Is that round object casting the long shadow between the rings, Daphnis?
This is one of the most gorgeous space photos I've seen in a long time! I love how it adds a totally new dimension and perspective on something we've seen hundreds of times.
This is fantastic, what's the source of the image, any higher res?
Looks like an attenuated interference pattern, can anyone explain why?
I have a hard time visualizing how high 1.6 miles is in this context.  

How thick is the ring under normal conditions?
Do Saturn's rings spin? Are they in constant motion?  That planets crazy looking
Hold on...the ring on Saturn is actually flat?? I though if you got up close it would be widely dispersed material that when observed from afar looks like a solid ring. 
Christ that's gorgeous. I'd love to see a closer picture. 
Are there any pictures from the actual moon? Can you see the rings from that perspective?
That's amazing.
Wonder if there's some place in the galaxy with even larger "structures"
Ohhh kinda spooky looking. I like it!   

Space is so cool. I really wish I had a telescope and easy access to a place without light pollution (that wasn't hours away).
saturn is so fucking cool.  coolest planet imo
I wonder what it would look like to be standing on those rings.
Almost looks like audio waves. I wonder how this pattern would sound.
At first glance I thought I was looking at the bottom of a rain gutter. 
I continue to be amazed of the beauty of our solar system. The more we zoom in, the more intricate beauty we find
And the black band in Saturn's ring are caused by the moon passing along it
Perfect timimg! I had lecture about this process and the rungs yesterday!
Daphnis must not be much larger than a typical shepard moon to have such a localized and non uniform effect.
They won't be 1.6 miles high, they'd be 1.6 miles wide.

The rings are only about 300 feet thick.
The shadows look like radio waves or a heart beat monitor, pretty neat!
So, will it fall down and land on earth, since it's obviously broken?
can you land on rings... someone explain....or build a house on them.
Just think those little tiny looking shadows are formed due to vertical walls 1.6 miles high! Jesus Christ Saturn is big! for some reason you think its way smaller then Jupiter but its not!
So wait, are these new structures that were created by natural forces within the last few decades? How were these not discovered earlier, or are they forming within a considerably short period of time?
Is Daphnis being pulverized by the ring material, or is it gathering ring material? Or both? My question is, how is it that a moon can exist within the ring structure, yet continue to maintain it's own structural integrity?
Where can I find the closest image of these rings? Are they literally a flat layer of what looks to be liquid/gas, or are they made of of rocks?
That looks like an audio track.. Music of the Spheres? Or what does it say?
Is it possible to 'read' the gaps in these rings, like a vinly record? What is Uranus trying to tell us by forming these rings?

Intersting fact: you can find 50 earths in these shadows!
I wonder what would be the view like from the surface of that moon...
Damn, I feel dumb but, I didn't even know there was a moon inside the rings. That's pretty damn awesome.
Does anyone else find it cool that the shadows of the waves in the rings around the passing moon look a bit like an interference pattern?

Although it's probably more like a splash.
Is it just me or do you guys find it hard for your brain to visualize and fathom what im looking at. Im constantly boggled by pictures of the stars and planets. Maybe its me being uneducated or thats just so damn incredible that my mind can't believe it.
gravity doesn't cause the towers, electromagnetic forces do. That's why they maintain their shape around the orbit and don't collapse as they're in a new plane of orbit. 

I would bet that there are towers on the other side as well- think of it as metal flakes forming field lines around a magnet.
we should send a probe to the dark side of the sun to see if there are any other planets behind it
[deleted]
and on tonight's Richard Hoagland show....ANCIEN ALIEN CITIES ON SATURN'S RINGS!!!
I figured it out. Saturn's rings are a digital medium with information from our alien creators. "how do you know that?" I hear you asking through the internet.

Well, Saturn's rings look like a record. Which we could scan with lasers and play back like the groovers of a laser disc... I mean DVD... I mean Blu-ray. I bet, if you were to take all the ring's data, it would be a [picture](http://ih1.redbubble.net/image.44754698.6859/fc,550x550,white_black.u2.jpg) of our makers.
Can someone good with sound editing apply this to audio so we can listen to it?
RIiiight, Nice try NASA. We all know those are really just high-end alien hotels. 
This kind of facility is called an arc jet, or arc heated wind tunnel. They're typically used for testing thermal protection systems in simulated hypersonic flight or reentry conditions.  There are lots of videos online if you're interested in seeing them in action.

EDIT [This ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCUcE0D_pcQ) has some decent footage 


the font choice is my favourite part of this photo
What generates the immense heat required for the test?
Anyone have a video source for this? Would be cool to see it in action.
They should build the heat shield out of whatever the arm is made of!

^(I'm a bot; I first read this thread at 04:00 UTC on 4th Dec 2015. www.decronym.xyz for a list of subs where I'm active; if I'm acting up, message )^[OrangeredStilton](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=OrangeredStilton&amp;subject=Hey,+your+acronym+bot+sucks).
From the article found by /u/ToughLoveAndToenails

&gt;Adaptive Deployable Entry and Placement Technology (ADEPT)....is a mechanically-deployable heat shield concept using carbon fabric: a flexible heat shield that expands to “open” like an umbrella. Recently, Ames’ engineers successfully completed heating simulation testing of an ADEPT model under conditions akin to entering the Martian atmosphere.


&gt;The photograph above shows one of these tests. In it, a flow of extremely heated air is exiting the 21-inch diameter nozzle from the left, causing a bow shock to form in front of the ADEPT test article, which is attached to a water-cooled support arm. Surface temperatures on the test article reached 3,100 degrees Fahrenheit. The bluish-hue streaks, streaming away from the test article, are due to the decomposition of the resin-infused protective layers that prevent degradation of the stitched fabric joints.


Reminds me of that breathtaking scene from Apollo 13. They detach the Odyssey, turn the Command Module away from the Earth. They start to sink into the atmosphere, the (hopefully functional) heatshield starts to glow, and the music rises.

"Gentlemen, it's been a privilege flying with you."
This is called Arcjet testing if people want to see more of this. 
I prefer the Kerbal way, strap it to a rocket and see if it stops the pilot from dying. This one may be cheaper though. 
As smart as these scientists are, they still use comic sans. Wtf guys?!
Is this a full scale test?

Do you have anymore infornation? 
So are they testing this for seepage/cracks?  What should the temperature behind the shield be?
This stuff is really crazy. I'm sorry I have no real source but my roommate who is a physics/astronomy major or something along those lines told me, today actually, that if you held a torch to a heat shield until it was cherry red, by the time you set the torch down and tried to touch it, it would be completely cool. 
I thought there was a person standing in it at first. The head would be that circular thing at the very top and then the shoulder right under that. I was super confused until I realized that it was just the shape of the heat shield.
Can someone explain how this heat shield works?
I'm curious about the durability of the heat shield, does it have a limited number of uses or it it just that it's impervious to heat now and for ever due to the type of material?
Does anyone know of a video using thermal imaging? It would be interesting to see that footage.
Was that built with Issac?

I think I've seen a model of that piece before.
are there two heat shields?  or is the smaller one a reflection?
I've always wondered: does testing a heat shield still make it good for use? Like, is it more susceptible to fault following a testing? Or is it like driving a car off an auto dealer's lot: has a few miles, but still good?
When I see something like this, it's always remind me the feeling what this STS-133 launch video gives me: https://youtu.be/kayCLca1YMc?t=4m17s

Dumb question: is it possible to produce a force in front of the aircraft that diverts air around the craft? Say a laser or plasma, I realize then, how would it slow down if it was flying in a vacuum.
could you like put a hot dog on a coat hanger into that and then cook it in like 2 seconds?
Thanks for the new wallpaper! How many degrees (celcius) does the heat shield experience during reentry?
I sat here staring at that for like a minute before I realized it wasn't a gif.
I did this in ksp once with a bunch of engines pointed at a large heat shield with Jeb on the other side. Kept running out of fuel before running out of Jeb.
give me two bottles of 'z: nothing beyond' hot sauce

put that thing in my toilet

and in two hours you will have a heat shield melted in the span of 18.1674 seconds
According to [this story](http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum30/HTML/000971.html), once a upon a time an unfortunately placed rivet in a space shuttle arc jet test model altered the plasma flow in a way that prevented prediction of a reentry hot spot on the real vehicle's OMS pods, which years later led to a near burn-through on STS-9. 
Well there is something I've never seen before. Our side has more or larger dark spots. Why is that?
Created using the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter data and a custom written OpenGL renderer.

http://bartoszwojczynski.com - more of my astronomy &amp; astrophotography stuff

Why do we only see the one side? Seems frickin' lame if you ask me. 
"There is no dark side of the moon really, as a matter of fact, it's all dark"
FAKE!! they shopped out the nazi-base, MIB alien prison and the decepticon shipwreck!

edit: typo
Is there a reason why the side facing earth seems so much more damaged than this side?
[This is what's actually on the other side](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/9d/DSI_hdapproach.png/revision/latest?cb=20130221005853)
wait, netflix told me aliens are drilling on the darkside of the moon? what gives??
Why... why have a rendering when you can get a [real photo](http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/653380f3abd9779893c96e6ab33a8d71/202428781/dscovr-moon-transit.jpg)?
Why is it called the dark side of the moon? Does sunlight never reach there?
Are there any publicly available high res photos of the dark side of the moon? If no why not? 
The internet has ruined me. I know the moon doesn't have a butthole butt I can clearly see that it does.
You forgot to include all the glass domes, the 7 mile high tower of sinus medii and various other things.  ;)
Why is this a "photorealistic rendering" instead of a "photograph"?
Hold up. The moon doesn't spin? Only one side faces us at all times?
Wow, as a 3D artist who's tried my hand at astronomy renders before, let me just say this is **really** well done.
[This is what's actually on the other side](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/9/9d/DSI_hdapproach.png/revision/latest?cb=20130221005853)
If this had been the side facing us, imagine our surprise at seeing how interesting the far side is.  In other words, we got lucky in seeing the interesting side first.
Where is the colour of the moon? Every picture, of no matter what side, is usually white washed or black and white?
I was led to believe there was a Nazi outpost on the far side of the moon. 
What reason makes the meteor hits almost always perfectly round? I'm sure the meteors arent always perfectly round
This can't be accurate.  I don't see any cities or bases Nazi or otherwise.
I think you missed a very important part... it's not gray! It has tons of subtle color variations.
True colors look something like this
http://thelivingmoon.com/43ancients/04images/Moon7/Galileo/Moon_Color_Galileo_02_PIA00405.jpg 
EDIT: I seem to be tying the knots now... why are the other pics from your site in color? Why not make the render the same? I think you could probably get a fairly accurate approximate by traslating the color info according to the value.
So tidal forces or how the moon's mass was never uniformly distributed, one side to always face the earth.
It must be old, look at the top left seems to be caused by the sun.
Just throwing this out there, but is it possible that when the pail is moving by the Earth's gravitational pull?
With enough force to hold it up , it will create a circular crater.
Is it just me, or is there a huge satanist star inscribed in a circle traced on the moon?
Would it be difficult to get a satellite around the back of the moon and take a real picture? 
I know it's not possible to see the "dark side" of the moon illuminated from Earth due to it being tidally locked to us.  But a satellite orbiting the moon would be able to take pictures, using visible light, of that side when it is illuminated (and facing away from the Earth).  Do these photos exist?  Or has no satellite been tasked with that project?

Or do scientists even bother with conventional cameras and instead use "photorealistic rendering" from the non-visible spectrum for pretty much everything in space?
It's so close yet only like 30 people have seen it for real. 
I assume that the left side of this picture is the right of what we see when looking from earth?

Why is it that one side has so many more craters than the other?
The Far Side of The Moon......That would make an awesome album title 
You guys see that spot that's a little above and to the right of the center? That's the moon's butthole.
The ejecta rays from that one big impact spread over a pretty large percentage of the surface, it also looks relatively recent in a four billion year time scale.
Assuming this rendering is new, I'm one of the first in all of humanity's history to see what the far side of the moon looks like, and I don't care much for it. I'm sure anytime past 100 years ago everyone thought it was impossible to ever see it. But now I'm looking right at it. 

I know that can be said about a lot of things, but still.
Pff yea right like im supposed to believe there isnt an amusement park on the moon, moon gate 2015
I showed my son this. I want to inspire my children to be artistic and to reach for their dreams. This is a wonderful drawing and this makes me happy for some reason. 
What about the water on the moon, anyone else remember the nuke that sent a splash of water up? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_A119
I don't understand how the moon has no spin... like, there is nothing at all ?   it is just stationary ?   How can it not have ANY  rotation ? 
I'd say we got the more interesting side. Not that it's not interesting to see the other side -- it's like being able to see the back of your head
What is that crater with what looks like longitude lines coming out of it? It also exists on the other side and I have always wondered what that is. Are these points the magnetic axes?
The reason the far side being thicker only on the left is how the moon's effect on tidal forces or how the opposite side of the moon favors the Earth after it first formed and while the Earth to the Earth side by about 2km.
The moon, contrary to what we used to believe, is not exactly on the far side being lumpier than the diameter of the past for the moon in space, you will see that it does.
The coolest thing is that would also pull the lava towards the thinner side, making the far side actually looks even more cratered...it just has less maria.
I'm late to the party but does anyone else not see Patrick Star's crater? 
This is great to see. It has such a different look to it. I like the star formation in the middle
You can still see where the Soviet reactor went critical prematurely because they forgot to account for the additional radiation due to the lack of a magnetosphere.
More specifically, this scale is called Albedo, and the Moon is essentially black and white?
Does no one have access to a camera with flash? Why has no one done this?
The moon has such a mystical yet beautiful aspect to it. Such a philosophical way to view it.
The moon rotates... the "far side" changes constantly...?
That doesn't look nearly as interesting as the near side.  I wonder why that should be.
We definitely received the better, more interesting side of the bargain!
Are there any publicly available high res photos of the dark side of the moon? If no why not? 
is it just me or did this seem to be slowly rotating? i had to double check it was a gif...
Where is the colour of the moon? Every picture, of no matter what side, is usually white washed or black and white?
It is surprising that the moon has so many craters on its surface. It makes the Moon look as though it is the shield of the Earth, and makes me wonder why is not the Earth hit by meteors that often.
Could someone point out the nazi moon base, I can't seem to find it?
Why do we not have actual photographs of the other side?
hang on...are you literally able to see the moon transit in real time or did your tripod move?
Holy shit thats awesome! Details about your equipment? 
Do you snap stuff like this often? Mind if you share your snapchat?
oh wow you can see the moon moved a bit, i didnt know you could see such things using DSLR and a tele lense
Thought i was in /r/shittyearthporn for a second but then it focused! Very cool! 
[I did the same thing a while back, but yours looks waaay better](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3amkaq/looking_into_my_telescope/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)
This is inredible! I just *have* to get me some kind of telescope, I really want to do this.
what kind of telescope do you use/ would a cheap telescope be able to view the moon like that?
People always focus on the telescope, but if you want to do astrophotography you need to look at the MOUNT first. A mount that is good for visual use may be very inadequate for astrophotography... partly because of the precision needed and partly because you are loading up the mount with more weight to do astrophotography (camera, adapter, autoguider, etc.)

You may be better off getting a smaller scope (less weight) and reducing the demand on your mount until you learn what you are doing. The mounts get pricey as you go up in quality.
See any of the moon landing trash we left up there? If so, that what shut up a whole lot of people who think the moon landing was staged in Hollywood. 
Are you digitally zoomed in on the camera screen or is that the actual full resolution? I have a 400mm lens for my camera and it doesn't fill up the frame that much on my crop sensor. But maybe its the multipliers on the telescope?

Wow.  I remember when I got a telescope as a kid and looking through it I could see mountains on the moon and it tripped me out that I was looking at them from so far up.

This is like 10 times cooler.  
Could you see astronauts, had this been the 70s? Or is the magnification not that high.

May I ask, how did you do this?
Hey OP, any chance you could upload some pictures of the moon like that. Would make awesome wallpapers. Incredible work :D
From the description and the first half of the video, I was ready to call this stupid. Yay, the moon on a screen, booooring.

Then it focused and got the brightness adjusted. Holy crap.

Do you have a picture directly from the DSLR?

I was looking at the moon about an hour ago with my telescope and  the lighting made the hill in stevinus crater glow brightly. Makes you wonder how some of these craters have high hills in the middle
Is there a youtube link for this? I'm having a lot ob trouble viewing this on mobile
This is freaking awesome!  I was out taking 30-second exposures with my Nikon on Saturday night.  The sky above the Blue Ridge Parkway near Boone, N.C. was finally clear for once.  The stars were incredible!  Too bad the moon wasn't in full-view :(  
So I don't know much about telescopes but depending on the phone, if you tap the screen while taking a snapchat video it will refocus the camera quicker so the glare is much less. Good especially handy since the videos are so short.

The moon does move very quickly No, it's the earth that provides most of the equipment you are doing go for a second but then it focused!

Jim Lovell is the only person who went to the moon twice and didn't land on it. 
If you think that is depressing, you should hear the story about an astronaut who goes deaf in a training exercise underwater from a communications malfunction. Im having a hard time finding it, but i will update. 
I met Fred Haise about a week ago!  [I'm the fat one with the phaser rifle keychain, not the baby or the female.](http://i.imgur.com/hxwc5XM.jpg)

Also, that's his spacesuit behind us!  He said he was really bummed that it wasn't dirtier...  You know, from moon dust.  I thought that was a pretty good joke.
Even though Lovell never walked on the moon, he is much more well known than some of the astronauts who actually did.
Lovell spent two weeks in a Gemini capsule. It's the size of a Volkswagen Beetle. Two guys for two weeks. Serious respect for that. 
i've trained for the Fra Mauro highlands and this is *flight surgeon horseshit*, Deke!
"I could putt it in from here on the Moon" -Jim

"You ain't on the Moon Jim, take a shot anyway, nothing to loose but your pride!" -Fred

*laughter* -Both together
I know Al Bean said his crew was the best and could have easily done any of the missions, except 13. 
It's just as well - they would have died within seconds with those outfits on
doesnt the appolo 13 crew hold the record for the farthest humans from earth?
That looks like Craters of the Moon national monument in Idaho. It was named so because most of the Apollo astronauts trained over the lunar-like landscape, which is essentially solidified lava.

Sometimes life throws at you the space adventures you never planned for. 
The film starts on July 20, 1969, in the home of astronaut Jim Lovell (Tom Hanks). Jim and a number of other NASA families are gathered to watch the moon walk by Apollo 11's astronauts. Later on, Jim contemplates how close he came to the moon when he was orbiting it on Apollo 8, and thinks about one day setting foot on the moon, as his wife Marilyn (Kathleen Quinlan) tries to keep from thinking of her husband going off on another mission.
[I met Fred Haise year before last](http://i.imgur.com/P9SvHbO.jpg), he was super awesome! 
I cannot be the only one who expected them to be attempting the Michael Jackson moonwalk. 
They may not have touched the surface of the moon, but they were people who went the furthest from the Earth possible.
Does anyone know where this is located?  It would be cool to visit where they shot the video of the moon landing.


*It's a joke people, calm down*
No one would remember them if they'd walked on the Moon. 
Even though Lovell never walked on the moon, he is much more well known than some of the astronauts who actually did.
Apollo 13 astronauts Jim Lovell and Fred Haise train for the moonwalk.
According to my friend Dave, *none* of the astronauts ever made that walk. Our relationship is a bit strained. 
Not exactly relevant, but I went to Elementary school with Jim Lovell's grandson. When we were in 5th grade, Jim Lovell came and spoke to the whole grade about exactly what happened on Apollo 13. Cool shit.
That's kind of depressing, training for a mission you're looking forward to only to have the oxygen tank of your spaceship blow up, and then never go to the moon again.

**Edit:** Words
My dad attended a dinner for a conference he was invited to a couple of years ago. One of the guests was Jim Lovell and my dad was going crazy over him being there. 

So, here's my dad at this dinner with several other high-profile guests being swarmed by entrepreneurs,  and Jim Lovell was surrounded by a couple of friends and the odd suit or so. My dad, feeling out of place, wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible but not without at at least talking to the man. 

He walked over to Jim Lovell and just told him how big of a fan of him he was and how he was an inspiration to his son (me). Lovell, I suppose sensing my dad's nervousness, offered him a drink and to sit down with him and a couple of others for dinner, but my dad said no and that he had other obligations (I still give my dad a hard time about not taking him up on that offer). My dad said thanks and began to walk away but before he could, Lovell asked him what my name was. My dad told him, and Lovell grabbed a napkin and quickly wrote down:

"Always aim for the stars (my name)!" along with his signature. My dad said goodbye again and left the dinner. On his way back home, he grabbed a couple books on astronomy for kids (I was 10 or 11 at the time) and a DVD of Apollo 13 and made the whole lot a birthday present for me. 

When I saw that napkin, I thought it was the coolest thing ever - a signature from one of my heroes! I read those astronomy books in a couple of days and since then have been infatuated with the cosmos. I wish I still had that napkin but it got lost in my move to my new place. But I've been studying astronomy at university for the last couple of years and am living in one of the best cities for astronomy research in Canada, and it was really all due to Jim Lovell and that damn napkin. My dad said he was one of the most polite and humble persons he's ever met.

TL;DR: Jim Lovell is an awesome guy.
Just waiting for someone to post this picture with the title "Images of astronauts faking moon landing!"
Had the opportunity to meet him A few weeks ago. The feeling of meeting one of the few who has been to the heavens and back was incredible. Also, a really freaking nice guy.
maan, he even trained in black and white, just like the real moon landing! 

those NASA guys know what´s up.
I got a chance to use a similar rig in Huntsville once. 1/4 Earth gravity is a blast until you get cocky and ricochet off a concrete wall. 
     I doubt they had -that- problem on the moon... although there is plenty of great footage of moon walkers wiping out in other ways.

This picture is a FAKE! It was actually taken on the Moon, in a secret Moon base built during the late 1960's. What you see is Jim Lovell training in the Moon's gravity to walk on the Earth for a role in a faked Hollywood film. Get real...
[deleted]
For people wondering; Apollo 13 was aborted due to an oxygen tank explosion.
My grandma went on a date with him in high school, so she claimed. 
Everything I know about Apollo 13 is from the Tom Hanks movie. How accurate to the real mission was the film? 
Other fun fact. He was also on the Apollo 8 mission which went to the moon but did not land (intentionally). 

So Lovell has been within a few hundred kilometers from the moon twice and never got to land. 
Have you ever dreamed of going where people like me, but not me, have gone before?
At first glance I thought he had balloons like in UP. 
http://imgur.com/qVmdrGM
Anyone else?
This image is simply more proof that the Apollo 13 moon landing was fake. Look! You can even see an extra in the shot! And don't even get me started on how visible the strings are!
1/4 Earth gravity is a raging alcoholic after his restaurant closed.
More depressing, training the guy on something he will never do, down to perfection. 
They had to return because of an oxygen tank explosion or something right? 
From The Earth To The Moon is a great HBO mini series on the early stages of NASA and the Apollo 13 episode is one of my favorites. Poor Jim, he got shafted on the moon trip. 
Mr. Lovell has long been my favorite astronaut. But in all honesty, I think 80% of my opinion of him is based on Tom Hanks' portrayal in *Apollo 13*. I was so disappointed that by the time I made Eagle Scout he had decided to stop signing books for new Eagles. My brother got a signed copy of Apollo 13 though (made it all the worse).
Isnt Lovell the only person to have been around the moon twice (Apollo 8 and Apollo 13) but never landed on it?

And I still think they should name the first moon base after the Apollo 13 crew. They wont of course, but naming it after people who famously never landed on the moon seems oddly appropriate to me.
A photo of hope now really elicits more of a feeling of melancholy to me, wonder if he feels the same way looking at this photo or that the accomplishment of the program was bigger than his desire to push his feet through lunar dust
It's the third brightest object in the moon landing https://youtu.be/P6MOnehCOUw I have a friend at work who insists only the first time, obviously the next 6 attempts were real.
1/4 Earth gravity is a raging alcoholic after his restaurant closed.
I would love to see some one colorize this picture and make the back wall a green screen.
So has Jim Lowell got anything to do with Percival Lowell, the man behind the Lowell Oberservatory which led to the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh?
So that's what it looked like before they added the special effects
maan, he even trained in black and white, just like the real moon landing! 

those NASA guys know what´s up.
I think it's cool that at the time they thought the surface of the moon would be sandy
Reddit just LOVES rubbing it in Jim Lovell's face that he didn’t get to walk on the moon. I wouldn't be surprised if these "suck it Jim Lovell" posts are probably made by Buzz Aldrin. 
This mafka here remind me of Cid Highwind from FF7 gnomesayen? He be all into that shit getting ready but nope
Why is only one of the moons tidal locked? Will the other ones eventual succumb to the gravitational pull/torque of Pluto and lock themselves as well? Or is Pluto's gravitational pull too weak?
[Animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOgIsb2KjSQ) of Pluto's moon Nix spinning, apparently Hydra does this too.  Resonance gets weird about halfway through.
I can't help but feel it is unfair that Pluto has four moons and we only have one.
why aren't the orbits elliptical?  why are some of the moons represented by ellipses?  because they are not spherical?  

this is an awesome gif but i wish there was some kind of legend or other info.  i think i have figured out what is going on but it took me a while.

it's from the wikipedia page


[family portrait](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Nh-pluto_moons_family_portrait.png) 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Pluto
If Pluto is no longer considered a planet are its moons no longer considered moons?
Does anybody know how long a day is on the outermost moon?
For some reason I can't help but identify with the purple one.

And feel slightly jealous of Pluto and Charon.
so why does the one moon spin clockwise, while the other is anti clockwise?

Is Pluto the one in the center? Why is it spinning so strangely? Aren't planets  supposed to just rotate? It feels like it's circling something near it.
An interesting fact that I just realized - the entire Plutonian system would fit *inside* of Jupiter.
It's interesting how Charon is tidally locked to Pluto, *and* Pluto is tidally locked to Charon.
Neat, looks like you could build a bridge / cable elevator between Pluto and Charon.
Moons or Infinity Stones? Pluto confirmed for Avengers Infinity War.
Could I stand on the surface of the Hydra? If yes, how fast could it spin before it would send me flying because of centrifugal force?
Can't help but think after careful examination of the outlying moon: "There is ALWAYS the odd one".
Pluto confirmed for Blind Idiot God Azathoth with his insane priests dancing around him.
That last moon is that guy at every party who thinks he can dance after copius amounts of drink and ecstasy. Silly moon.
Did we get pictures of these moons in the recent fly by? I honestly only thought Pluto had one moon.

"Fuck, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck, hold on, I got this. Damn it. Fuck. Heeelllppppp." - Hydra, the outside moon

That being said,  I looked into its actual rotation time, apparently it rotates so chaotically that the whole rock flips over every now and again and the period of its spin varies wildly. Neat.
"Heres a red rubber ball. Go play by yourself for a little bit, mkay?" -pluto to blue moon
What are those white dots supposed to be?  Sorry if it's obvious.
Why is the outer most moon spinning so quickly???
Take it easy guys,the so-called Hydra moon is the baseball we lost at a 7th grade class break many years ago...
If that is not a fun planetary system to live in, I don't know which one could be!

I mean, he main "planet" facing the same face of the biggest moon, and the additional 4 moons spinning at different speeds and even with different directions!
This pictures makes me wonder if Pluto and Charon will eventually collide with one another.
[deleted]
If you were born on one side of Pluto, you might never know Charon exists, but still know you have a bunch of moons!
 Can someone explain before I get deleted why did the mod remove all of those comments? What the hell?  They were just here, then I refresh the page and you deleted them?  Why are you deleting all of those comments?
The orange one and Pluto are locked in a very intense, romantic dance
So Pluto and it's inner most moon are always facing each other?
So, what's up with the one that's rotating counter-clockwise?
lol! Pluto and it's closest moon look like they're constantly squaring off against each other.
the big picture movement looks same as water going down the drain, will all the moons and pluto collide in the middle eventually? :D
It wouldn't be so obvious if the moons weren't shaped that way. I wonder if any of the other satellites in the universe, rotate this quickly or at all. 
How was this gif made? Any other gifs like this one?
is there a (simple) program that lets you plot planetary orbits like in this gif?
I was listening to a Boiler Room set when the gif started. Was perfect.
You know how the closest moon stays facing pluto just like our moon does on earth, does a moon have to be a certain size to do this? does it need to have enough gravity to lock onto its companion planet?
Alpha howler... Dont know what it means but its better than moon vixen
Is there any source for this? How much this is accurate? Who made this? Other info you could share? Thank you.
Fruit Orbitals... a new candy from the people who brought the world dehydrated ice cream
why are al of the orbits circles. with that many bodies, each body should have a very strange orbital pattern.
Forgive my ignorance but... I assumed the center of gravity would be a little further from Pluto's surface.
Pluto to Charon: ["I Only Have Eyes for You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63nlhoda2MY)
Reminds me of the Teen Girl Squad #10:

TGS: Let's get ready to look SOOO GOOOD  
What's Her Face: Weeee  
Strong Bad: Looks like we have a spinner...  
Pluto is like a poor Muslim man, with more wifes than he can handle. 
Would gravity be noticeably different directly under Charon?  Would lifting into orbit be cheaper or would your proximity to the mass of Pluto negate that?  Just curious about how the barycenter over the surface of a body would impact gravity on it's surface.
Hydra made me laugh for no good reason. Just the fact it's spinning so fast was hilarious to Me. I'm tired. 
I want to build a space base on that spinning purp!

Now let's see you try to orbitally bombard me!
Quick question.  Would the combined gravitational forces of the inner four moons ever pull the fifth one from a sustainable orbit to one with a collision course with another moon or pluto itself?  How often would the moons converge to allow this to happen?
Best viewed while listening to this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi9sLkyhhlE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi9sLkyhhlE)
I feel like I'm looking at an interstellar teacup ride.
My question is just about nomenclature, not that it makes any difference. Since Pluto is under the header of plutoid dwarf planets, are these really "moons" or is there another name for objects which orbit plutoids? 
How is the closest moon and Pluto orbiting the center of gravity in the same amount of time? This has to be  inaccurate
Darin Crapo posted this on his youtube channel, mot likely inaccurate.  
Yep, most of the major bodies in the solar system all lie along this solar plane which we call 'The Ecliptic'. 
Planets orbit in a plane, if you look from the right place you'l see them always in line. 
You discovered the ecliptic! :). Actually, since you didn't already know what it was it was insightful to spot it. 
Don't worry - it's just the Harmonic Convergence.  The spirit portals at the poles are gonna open up, and a couple of giant kites are going to have a battle.  Just stay away from the purple ray beams, and you'll be ok.
Oh shit someone better go get Hercules because it looks like Hades is about to release the titans! 
I saw that too, i also pulled up Sky Map and took a picture:

This seems like an excellent opportunity to troll people who believe in astrology. Post this in the appropriate subreddit and watch them panic! 
I actually took a picture of the moon, Venus, and Jupiter in a line at 5am on Saturday morning from my backyard, because I thought it looked cool.

If you're on the beach right before sunrise and want to impress a special person you're with, look for a couple planets and use them to figure out exactly where the sun will be when it rises. 
I love the grouping.  This is called the Ecliptic if you want to sound smart.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecliptic.  
It's almost like all the bodies orbit in approximately the same general plane!
Congrats, you discovered the ecliptic.  
I saw 3 shooting stars in the space of 15 minutes last night. Couldn't think of a sensible wish any of the times
Titans are coming back to take over the world. Someone call Hercules!!
Does SkyMap still work? I thought they stopped updating it years ago. I've been using Star Chart (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.escapistgames.starchart&amp;hl=en)

It has some nifty bells and whistles, like overlaying constellations on the stars so you can actually figure out what you're looking at in the sky. 
Pacific North Westerner here, thanks for bragging about being able to see the sky.

It's almost like they orbit around the sun on the same plane or something.
Aren't they always lined up? Maybe not that close, but they're all in the same plane.
It would be a lot more interesting if you looked up and the planets were scattered all over the place. That would be unexpected.
Stopped in for a [great conjunction](https://youtu.be/C4Wl7grhX2g) reference... was disappointed... so there ya go.  (actual astronomical [great conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_conjunction) which I was unaware of)
They're on the ecliptic, they're in a line anywhere on earth at any moment
Well, clearly it's the biblical end times.  Everyone leave your stuff with me for safe-keeping during the rapture.  I'll take great care of it.
It happens as the prophecy has foretold that planets will align and people will share pictures of it and say. "Cool."
Thought it was a shittyaskscience post. It would have been a good post up there.
The planets are always in a line along the ecliptic, as many others have mentioned. You can still see Mercury above the horizon a few minutes before sunrise... Given that the sun will be super close but below the horizon poses more of a risk to look at Mercury. 
Yes, the planets all orbit on roughly the same plane, but that doesn't mean they're in-line.  You couldn't draw a line through all of them.
---Just imagine a bunch of marbles on scattered on a table.  From the side of the table, it would seem as if they are all in-line.
---This is also true for the stars in our galaxy.  Any group of objects orbiting the same center of mass will eventually share the same plane because of the gravitational affect they have on each other.
Shouldn't there be some magic, catastrophic event that occurred when the planets aligned?
Now if they all overlap, comeback and make a new post. That should turn some heads
That's why the earth will be destroyed at 9am EST next Thursday. Goodbye all.
You've discovered the ecliptic plane. We've been hiding it for centuries, dammit!
Congrats, OP, for noticing! It'a also a bit sad, because a mere century ago *not* knowing this would be weird, as everybody had the sky as part of their lives.

Some questions to entice your learning: which are the constellations behind the sun and the planets? Do they look familiar? Imagine the Earth in half a year, which constellation will be behind the Sun then? 
Um....yeah, that's kind of what happens when all the planets are more or less in the same plane.

It's amazing how no one in /r/space knows anything about space
To reiterate on others' comments below, yes, all our planets are on a plane called the ecliptic. But it's interesting that they are all so close together in our sky. Good find, OP!
Wait... do you mean to say that ALL of the planets orbit the sun on the same plane??

/s
That app is the greatest. I've learned so many things such as the "elliptical plane" that you are now discovering. Enjoy!
it was like that 2 weeks ago. I saw Jupiter, Mars and Venus in a line every morning when going to work.. It's not like that anymore.. so what gives?
They have alined. We may now begin the cerimonial Sacrafice to our lord, potato salad.
Space is so fascinating. We know quite a bit but not nearly enough to truly understand it.  It is interesting that they are all so close together.
The planets have aligned!! Do the THING! Dont let your dreams be dreams!!
I totally saw the same thing and took a picture of it. Thought 'I should post this on reddit.' Then you took it to the next level with the graph.
Yeah the other night I noticed that Mars, Venus, Jupiter and the Moon were all in a perfect spot together for a photograph.  I ran in to get my camera, ran back out, and they were covered in cloud.  I waited 2 hours but the cloud never went away.
I love these apps.  I use one on my iPhone called Sky Guide.  I think it costs 1.99 USD but I've been using it for years now and don't regret it at all. It adds beautiful visuals and plays soothing music while you point it at the sky, and can give you detailed information on everything.  I'm glad I have these kinds of apps because I think the night sky is beautiful but I honestly have no idea what I'm looking at without a guide.
They're all in a line, the solar system is pretty freakin 2D
Hey which star map did you use? I really like its clarity and might start using this instead.
Sky Map still works?! The last time I had installed it it was junk.
The "Jesus Star" was probably a Super Nova, so we're all still safe.
I saw that too before going to work today! It was something mesmerizing
Good lord, according to every movie/TV show I've ever seen something horrible is about to happen!!
This morning on my way south I noticed this to the east. Very cool. Kinda neat when you can see so many at one time.
What app do you use? I'm always curious as to what I see in the sky..
*over the top Atticus voice* "MACGYVER, LOOK! THE GODS MARCH IN RANK!"
[Stellarium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.noctuasoftware.stellarium) is so much better.

In other news, all the stars in the milky way galaxy orbit in a (fairly) flat disc too - for the same reason the planets in our solar system orbit in a 2-d plane, angular momentum conservation

Meanwhile on Mars Earth and Venus will be seen as the bright dancing twins.
[I made a compilation with mine this morning, too!] (http://i.imgur.com/Kl1wjNv.jpg)
This fall's planetary conjunction has been interesting to watch. I tried to capture it on my phone last month.  From the horizon, Mercury is the speck just above the roof of the building, Jupiter next, dim smudge of Mars if you zoom all the way in, and Venus shining bright. http://i.imgur.com/N960Lm8.png
You will be able to see all of them (minus the sun) together next January-February.
I don't understand most of these comments and I have never seen all these planets lined up like this in the sky
I guess Hades is going to unleash the Titans and take over Olympus now as long as he makes sure Hercules doesn't fight.
Yupe if you forgot its too late... Today is the day we get to use the souls we harvested on holloween to make our "special" elixer... I did have trouble finding a sacrificial virgin tho...
Jupiter aligned with  Mars?  Then peace will guide the planet's and love will steer the stars.  This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.
The sun and the planets (and the moon to a slightly lesser extent) are always in a line. It's just a question of how far apart they are on that line. The solar system exists in a single plane (not exactly, but close enough for the human eye) so observing from the Earth, which is in the same plane, the other items in that plane appear in a straight line.
Your smartphone is even that smart, that it automatically drew a line through it and labeled it with "Ecliptic". ;-D
well... they're always in a line. it's the plane of the solar system
Hope no-one tells r/Lovecraft 'cause those are some awful right looking stars in my book. 
Obviously.  This is the ecliptic, the plane in which all of the planets orbit.  
Well... yeah. All the planets are basically all on the same plane. It's one of the reasons why Pluto was taken out as a planet, as it rotated around the Sun on a different plane.
Sorry for this r/space...

Its the (possibly) great conjunction. The prophesy! The prophesy!

Its really interesting to hear about these things happening to be serious though. I'm not superstitious enough to believe some kind of big event will happen because a bunch of planets aligned despite my username.
Mercury, being so low on the orbital plane at any given time of year.
You realize this is because... the planets are in the solar plane, right?
Someone call Hercules!! It's almost like all the planets were scattered all over the place.
Also, with a little more information about the picture taker like this http://i.imgur.com/d2LQIy4.png If we are at the same general direction.
I have these kinds of apps because I thought they stopped updating it years ago.
I've been watching Venus and then Jupiter for a couple months now. I didn't know that was Mars there. I suspected it could be but it seemed stationary compared to the other two. 

One thing about that map you showed is that Jupiter looks really big on the map but in the sky Venus is actually "bigger" in that it's very bright compared to Jupiter and therefore looks bigger. It's also closer, of course.

I've never really looked at the stars until this year as I have a job working nights and there have been so many clear night. I drive a truck and have seen so many cool shooting stars. Those are some of my favorite things to see. 
Just want to let you guys know who weren't there. The ritual went great and the Dark One has returned. We're having cake to celebrate, come down if you can.  
  
Also how often do the planets line up like this? I just want to know for... reasons. 
was wondering why my boner defied gravity at 3 am. all is explained.
Right, I noticed Saturday morning around 3am night fishing on the Sacramento river. I was like hmm, wonder which planets those are, since they don't twinkle. So I to busted out the sky map, I was like holy shit, I'm catching a monster fish tonight! Only caught a 16" striper. Lol
All I see is a jumbled mess of lines and overwritten text.  I love the stars at night tho
The Ecliptic is the name of my new metal band. Who's with me? We could use more cowbell. 
Thats what i saw right in my balcony at 5:30 am:

Was indeed an amazing spectacle.
*Using the archaic definition of visible bodies in the country and noticed that Mars, Venus, Jupiter and the Galilean moons of Jupiter are on the elliptic.
And the Internet forgot to find out first so we missed out on a doomsday prediction. Aw shucks.
It is crazy to actually see it first hand and understand what you're looking at
 It really give you a good perspective of how small we are. 
On Christmas morning, when Mars is fairly close to Spica, Comet Catalina will join the line-up!

As far as failures you need to realize that only 5 of the first 9 Pegasus launches succeeded; 3 of 5 for Ariane; 9 of 20 for Atlas; 9 of 21 for Soyuz; and 9 of 18 for Proton. So SpaceX going 20 for 24 pretty good.
It's about damn time that they get a solid confirmation. I get it that they are a very new company, a newborn compared to Boeing and others, but this took too damn long. 
As long as we keep ties with the cosmonauts, this is alright.
I think it would be interesting if the astonauts hijacked the space station and it somehow was part of a plan by evil mastermind Elon Musk to take over the world.
Any word on if they will be launching from Cape Canaveral? Article didn't specify.
I eagerly look forward to the day America can put a man into space.
has sapcex even put humans into orbit and back safely so far?
I honestly think using the Russians is the safer bet. The Soyuz is proven and their delivery system has stood the test of time.
Don't get me wrong; I like Elon Musk. But the privatization of the space program is bothersome. While I think private interest can be wonderful contributors in the endeavor, a public entity such as NASA is crucial when it comes to setting the narrative of objectivity and humanitarianism.
What a big step forward this is for the private space sector.

Only time will tell if it can be sustainable.
I'd be absolutely SHOCKED if SpaceX is taken humans to the space station by 2017 as this article says. It's a nice headline and might drum up some good public will for NASA/Elon, which I suppose is the point of making such an agreement.
Duh!  They frickin rented them the launch pads at Cape Kennedy for the next decade or so.
Well first they should try a successful launch; https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spacex+failure&amp;t=fpas&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images
My dream is to become an astronaut. I am 16 years old and i would love to work at the ISS. I hope by joining the air force and getting flight hours i can do that in the future. 
The article sounds like it's praising SpaceX *and Boeing* for offering alternatives to paying Russia to transport American astronauts to space while ignoring that Boeing + Lockheed = ULA transported American astronauts to space by buying old Soviet rockets from Russia.
They are gonna need a lot more launches without incident
I just want to say that I am good friends with the engineer who designs the custom trailers that pull much of the equipment for Space X. OK thanks, I will see myself out now.
Don't they still have to get a rocket off the pad and dock with the station?
Can someone ELI5 what spaceX is?
Finally, that space station can stop being at the mercy of Russia!
Space X is going to kill someone. With the amount of corners that they cut its amazing they have only had a few failures so far. 
Elon Musk, a the pioneer of this century, who will take us to the next real quickly. 
So glad NASA is paying more to have a for-profit middle man do the job they were literally created to do.
I'm so fucking tired of articles starting with "It's Official!" 

You wouldn't be reporting it as fact if it wasn't! You'd just be speculating otherwise. You don't need to tell us. 
SpaceX, the same Elon drives the workers/astronauts into the ground for long hours????? 
[deleted]
Erghh SpaceX groupies make me embarrassed to admit I like SpaceX. So OTT and emotional. 
This is a bad idea.  Only the government should take lives into space.
I spent time in Hawaii and talked to locals that were born and raised there about this issue. Its polarizing.

People *against* it brought up the need for spirituality and respect for the Hawaiian culture lost over hundred of years of Western influence.

Argument *for* the telescope, however, claimed that building it would do nothing but **respect** their history. How did the ancient Hawaiians get to the island? They used the stars. It was "in their blood" to understand the heavens. Most of the those complaining are young disenfranchised people struggling in one of the crappiest economies in America.

Of course this could be a generalization based on second hand observation.

As for me, as big as these telescopes are, they look like ants on top of these *massive* volcanoes. Ruining the scenery is nonsense.
6th generation, Big Island born and raised, here. 

This whole affair is a tragedy. It is ignorance, perpetuated by misinformation sustained by a small group of people that feel they have a responsibility to protect aspects of a lifestyle that is no longer embraced, all for the sake of maintaining some fractured cultural identity. None of the protesters can explain why the mountain is sacred. The mountain is no more sacred than the land that surrounds it. According to ancient Polynesian beliefs, EVERYTHING contains mana and is therefore sacred. A lot of the protesters are not native. Appropriating another culture for the sake of assuaging their own white guilt, is self serving and only adds fuel to the fire. I'm not saying that it's all whitey's fault at all; it is not. The local mindset of being a perpetual victim to Western encroachment is also to blame.

The past has proven, time and time again, that we have been victimized and taken advantage of by foreigners, this is true. However, this isn't always the case and to use this tired rallying cry of the big bad white man screwing us out of future has to stop.

Is the mountain so sacred that putting a stop to the construction of a telescope is seen as a victory while the US military shoots, bombs and burns the mountain on a daily basis?

Do you eschew science and technology yet  drive all over in your fancy cars, taking selfies with your smart phone, visiting the doctor to be prescribed medicine for whatever condition ails you, then go home cook something in the microwave while watching your giant TV?

This isn't about sacred anything. We don't live our lives tied to the appeasement of na akua (the gods) any more. That was the only time that sacredness and abiding to tapu had any relevance. You cannot cherry pick your causes because it makes you feel good about yourself, when all you are doing is causing problems and doing a disservice to your cultural past by attempting to join the past with the present.

I agree that in cases such as this complete and total transparency is crucial; case in point, the Super Ferry debacle. But blocking a road and waving signs around might make you feel like you are accomplishing something, but is only going to prolong the inevitable. This will likely result in a total ban of non essential personnel on the mountain. Wait and see.
 

It is sad that the fine people involved in the TMT project have been handed this set back after all the work they have done and the great pains they have taken to accommodate the local community.
There are already several observatories on said mountaintop. Why are they upset about this one in particular, but the existing ones are ok?
I wonder who comes up with the relative size names on these things.  "Very large", "Extremely large", "Mega", etc. Why not use a more timeless name, like the name of a scientist and the size of the light collecting area?  Otherwise, I have another suggested name: The "Ultimate Biggerer" telescope. 
This isn't a 'natives vs everyone else' argument, it's complicated. There are plenty of natives in favour of the construction, provided it is done in a responsible fashion (which it of course will be). Some people seem to presume they speak for others when they in fact do not.

Having observed on Mauna Kea (at the JCMT) I can attest to the awe-inspiring nature of the mountain. It is no wonder people find it spiritually significant. 

What should also be remembered is the boost that astronomy gives to the economy of the Big Island. We all need food, hotels, flights and cars, and we're all likely to buy souvenirs etc while we're there.
Sadly, because the science community is generally socially progressive and willing to listen, they're going to suffer.  The TMT project has a long history of working with the local government and people, and the University has demonstrated good faith by starting to close down and clean up existing sites, as well as agree to restrict tourism traffic.  But because the science community is actually interested in social responsibility, a great telescope that could be built in an environmentally responsible manner and be an economic and educational boost for the island will be shut down by a tiny, tiny core of protesters.

You won't see them protesting a Wal-Mart or other corporation this way, because Wal-Mart wouldn't even talk to them, wouldn't give them the right to protest on site (which TMT has given them), and also, they happen to like cheap western goods.  So science, which has been a great contributor to the island both economically and intellectually, will be the focal point of a debate about Hawaiian sovereignity, when all they really want to do is be culturally considerate, work hard, and do some astronomy.
It's not like they're decimating entire regions to build highways and shopping malls. It's a very reasonable amount of land being used for one of the greatest displays of scientific achievement, which simultaneously honours the heritage of the original settlers... This is a huge setback for more than just those directly involved with the project. 
&gt;Some Native Hawaiians say that the benefits to astronomy do not outweigh the need to respect and protect the natural and cultural environment. Many took to social media to praise the court's decision.

Are you fucking kidding me, what a disgrace.

So this is modern America now.
Born, raised, and living on the Big Island here (Hilo).  We don't need more "respect".  We need jobs.

Our economy sucks.  Our roads are in pathetic condition.  Our government offices are housed in crumbling, embarrassing buildings.  Our ecology and real estate have been destroyed by frogs.  Few tourists come here because there's much more to do on the other islands.  If we want to preserve the Big Island, then we need to draw scientists and engineers (and therefore money) here, not chase them away.
Oh ffs. So a permit for a 1.5 billion dollar scientific tool is being tossed because the issuing board didn't adequately listen to someone talk about the "sacredness" of the ground? 

 It's being built in a scientific reserve specifically allocated for this purpose. They agreed to remove at least three other observatories while building TMT.  They agreed to return almost 90% of the reserve to the state when their current lease expires. They even agreed to cultural training for every single visitor to the research park.  After all of the national attention the protests of the TMT have garnered I find it ludicrous that a judge could reasonably argue that the protestors point of view hasn't been heard.

  I hope the regulatory commission proceeds with haste to reissue the permit. Gotta start now to insure we give the blowhards against their judicially mandated time in the spotlight. Again. 
I cant' think of a more spiritual thing to be build than a telescope to peer into the depths of the universe we are part of. 
I have been on Mauna Kea and it is truly a spiritual place. Looking at the telescopes, I could sense the spirit of scientific research, which progressed humankind from mud huts to discovering the mysteries of universe.
You can't throw a stone anywhere in this world without someone saying the land is sacred.
Lol the reason is probably due to deeply rooted resentment of the American government due to Hawaii being taken from Hawaiians at gunpoint, literally. It's of no surprise that they're against the project because they still separate Americans as being colonialists that took their land and robbed them of their indigenous roots and rights. The reason for this is because many of then actively try to gain their sovereignty back. I'm from here and can say that it is mostly about the friction between the states and the native people rather than the non belief in science. You also need to respect their cultural heritage lolol. Most of the commenters here lack the perspective needed to make any judgment calls because it's hard to put things into context. Not that anyone outside of Hawaii would care, nor do i expect you to. But offering my .02 on the matter from what i know. 

That and they gimped out on legal procedures for this project resulting in a halt until proper permits are acquired. 

Also, the bias is strong in depicting locals as illogical people who are only doing this bc SHIELD VOLCANO IS MAGIIIUIIICC here, the fuck. Can't believe you guys are eating that up.

But yeah still sucks though, i was looking forward to the TMT.
Outrageous.  There is no moral, ethical, legal, or rational justification for putting a halt to such a thoroughly benign, globally supported project simply for the sake of a tiny group of extremist revenachists. 
It's super sad that superstition and tradition wins over progress and reason. These telescopes are literally invisible as seen from the bottom of the volcano, they do not bother anybody. People that oppose progress are just dumber than the rest and sadly, we let them speak and win. I hope they'll try to build the TMT in Chile or something. i really want this to come to life.
So they didn't build this telescope because the mountain is sacred. What? It's 2015 do people still think the peak of a mountain is magic?
I wonder if this was in retaliation for the Supreme Court blocking the native Hawaiian only vote. 
"desecrated by astronomical observatories."

Let that statement sink in for a minute. 
Hey r/space,

Maybe my opinion and views will be able to provide more insight to the situation. I'm a Native Hawaiian who was born and raised in Hawaii. Yet I've also been a space enthusiast for all of my life and I'm currently working towards getting my degree in Astronautical Engineering. I've also been a part of many of the groups around the islands who are against TMT and have been in the protests as well.

My stance on the situation is that the telescopes do nothing but respect my Hawaiian culture and history. It IS in our blood to understand the heavens and stars above, we were among the most skilled navigators the world had ever seen, we sailed the pacific using the stars as our guide to bring us to the islands in the first place. And in my opinion it's only right and it's something to be prideful of that we have one of if not the best sites on Earth to study the stars from. Dedicating a small piece of one of our most sacred lands to studying the stars makes sense to me as a space geek and a Hawaiian. 

Our ancestors looked to the stars to navigate and sail through the pacific. We as Native Hawaiians should look to the stars and honor our ancestors to now navigate and sail through the universe.

TMT, from what i've experienced, is being used as a gathering grounds. It's the main issue that many Native Hawaiians can gather against (since most have no cares about space at all) to finally come together and work towards reclaiming/stopping production on our lands. But I do believe that we are banding against the wrong issue.

What many of you don't know is that it's been a long struggle for us to try and fight back against the US for our home. We were illegally annexed into the US, our queen was held captive, our schools were taken over so that we were taught English and the Hawaiian language was banned, among many.. many more things. It doesn't matter that it happened 100 years ago and no one from that time is still alive. 

There is so much racist, hateful, and ignorant comments being posted here in the comments directed towards the Hawaiian people.  It's people with these mentalities that oppressed us in the first place.

If you have any questions feel free to shoot them at me. I have a lot more to say but I'm headed out to class :)




This isn't "just" a telescope. It will be the biggest optical telescope ever. One thing that has been lost in this discussion is the technology used in the thing. There are almost 500 mirrors that have to be precise, almost beyond imagination, and even they have to be slightly flexed to minimize atmospheric distortion (being called adaptive optics). The mirror array is huge, 30 meters across (almost 100 feet), so the observatory has to be even bigger, several stories tall.

Beyond the technology and religion, the real conflict is that there is an apartheid kind of structure that has developed. You have to read the history about how the first telescope got up there, with the promise of jobs and better education. It has ended up with the astronomers considering the locals too stupid to hire, and too stupid to learn. If you look at a photo of the observatory staffs, there is hardly a brown face there except for some from India.  That is the other problem, almost all the researchers are "imported" in. They are visitors and too often, act like visitors. You would think astronomers would be open minded but the field has become very much like the Holy of Holy's with only (white) high priests allowed. It has taken 50 years for this situation to develop. There are over a dozen observatories up there now, doing fantastic work, but the size of the TMT with another round of promised local high tech jobs that was the final straw. There is mass confusion on both sides going on with the real issues, which are complex and can't be handled with a 30-second sound bite. The state supreme court decision was a big surprise, though. This was the press release image that was sent out when construction was about to begin. It was probably meant to be impressive but it scared the hell out of a lot of people.

And yet again the collective progress of man is slowed by superstition
The progress of humankind, and a further understanding of the universe around us should heavily outweigh these petty issues.
While I respect ones cultural needs and opinions, I for one would be honored to share my home land with something that could benefit the entirety of the human race.  Its not a noisy power plant, its not a factory that consumes massive amounts of local resources, its just a giant telescope that will teach the world.
The funny thing is that there is already 11 telescopes on the summit. One more telescope is clearly too far.
The telescope could lead to discoveries about how to improve humanity's future...  Name it after the people complaining and continue building. 
How sad. Was really waiting for this telescope to show us amazing views of the heavens
Protest this huh? This is what you protest.

Are they just bored or something?
I guess the scenery of an island is more important than the scenery of everything in the universe. Seems short sighted....
I spent my honeymoon there (the Big Island) with my Wife. Because we are nerds, we spent a day to visit the observatories, and do a sky-watching event lower on the mountain at night after visiting the larger complex up on the mountain.  Our tour guide was a local who did a great job of educating the entire group on the special place the mountain holds in Hawaiian culture.  Overall it was a great experience that I would not trade for anything....  
	I don’t think the protesters claims are ludicrous, I just don’t understand many of their justifications, with the one exception being that to them, that land is sacred.  The claim that land is scarce and needs to be used for housing directly conflicts with the sacred land claim IMO. 
The claim that it would ruin the skyline seems also like an attempt to just list more problems without providing any solutions.  In my humble opinion, having been there, the skyline would not be “ruined” by the addition of another observatory.  I guess that is all in the eye of the beholder, but can’t some middle ground be reached? I don’t know maybe something like “hey we dismantled this observatory and two more are on the docket for decommission, how about we put our new shiny building where the other ones were so there is less of an impact”?  Maybe I’m not as artistic as the next guy but I don’t think another building would ruin the skyline, don’t get me wrong, the skyline is nothing short of EPIC up there, but I was looking out from the mountain not back at it.
I hope everybody comes to a reasonable solution to this.  I support the native claim to it being a sacred space, but wish they would clarify intentions on this…. Do they wish to dismantle every scope up there and return the mountain to a natural state? Because if not, maybe they need to take a hard look and see if there is a way to preserve the cultural importance of the mountain while embracing the scientific future (and economic benefit) of having world class observatory facilities in their state.  I’m curious to know the economic impact those facilities have on the big island.


Love how the youth decided this was a bad idea to have this mega-telescope built. So much for the future.
How can you look at any of the visually stunning photos of space taken by or the intellectually stunning scientific advances enabled by such telescopes and not see the construction of such technology as a beauty instead of a blemish upon the land. 
Honestly everything is sacred to someone. The telescope isn't some crusade of western imperialism. It's a tool to gain knowledge for all of mankind. The people that are too narrow minded to see that don't deserve my sympathies.
Basically it seems the Native Hawaiian's argument is "We called dibs on that mountain"
This is the danger of religion, people claiming that land is sacred and stopping progress scientifically that is vital.

Religion is made up your land is not sacred, time to grow up.
Spent 10 years in Honolulu for high school and college education. One thing I can assure you is the very real racism going on there. The native islanders simply hate white people. They seems to have a grudge against them for doing various business on their island. This whole incident isn't about the disrespect to their culture, it's simply racism. Ask anyone who spent time living in the islands of Hawaii and they too can tell you this is true. 
It would have been beautiful in a way too, looking deeper into the final frontier through a scientific instrument on a holy ground.

Then again I am a sentimental fuck who tries to find non-existent connections in everything 

*:  Yay Downvotes how beautiful their calm blue is, like sea with endless freedom 
I just don't understand why science would make the mountain unsacred.  Science **is** a sacred pursuit, and astronomy especially has long been held as the highest/purest of the physical sciences throughout history.  If they are banning tourists on the mountain too because there are supposed to be no people, fine.  But if there are still tourists coming up I don't see why there can't be a telescope.
they bring up a valid point.  the hawaiian supreme court wasn't going to give up on their constituents.  [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) is the full case
The first 20 telescopes were bearable. But the 21st one, uf, here we draw the line.
They aren't building a mall or a factory.  Once built, traffic will be minimal.  Environmental impact of its operation...small.

Shame they don't see that...or care to.
Uneducated, "spiritual", stupid people ruining everything with their protests? Like that's news...

Why do scientists keep wanting to build them there if there is always so much drama? Was Chile also opposed or what?
I've been there it's on top of a mountain far away from anyone else. What the fuck Hawaii. 
Why can't they upgrade existing telescopes instead?
Superstitious religious people blocking scientific advancement? Say it ain't so.
Can citizens declare anything to be sacred? Can I declare the Mississippi River to be sacred, and then ban ships from it?

This is just regular land, and these are just regular people, and the telescope project is just business.

It's not like they are disturbing an untouched area.  There is an entire area with this telescopes.

http://i.imgur.com/QypxBEV.jpg
Probably too late to add anything new to the discussion, but one of the primary pieces of evidence protestors cite is the [1998 State Auditors report of Mauna Kea site's management by the University of Hawaii.](http://lrbhawaii.info/reports/legrpts/auditor/1998/scr109_97.pdf)

tl;dr Lots of issues occurred and UH was said to have mismanaged it pretty badly. Now its fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...
They aren't even building it anywhere near the summit.  There are 11 other facilities between it and the summit.

Sometimes it's like people just complain for the sake of complaining and don't remember to think about what they say.
Wait, so does this mean it actually isn't being built now? Because I was really looking forward to this telescope in the 2030s or whenever it was scheduled to be complete. 

This is a *thirty meter* telescope. I quoted a scientist lecturing at my college using the example that this telescope would be able to see the *mosquito* on the *nose* of an alien on the other side of the Universe. 
There is literally nothing but rocks and plants up there.  Nobody uses that land for anything.  I was born and raised in Hawaii and still think that it should be built. Why do nothing with the land? Why not progress further into science?  Its like these people just want to live in the past.  Its sad imo.
When I heard, repeatedly, that one of the native Hawaiian opposition's chief arguments against this telescope was that it wouldn't be profitable enough, and that the concept of a non-profit organization was a *failed business model*... I knew these were a bunch of moronic sixth-grade dropouts.

I spent a couple years in Honolulu and Midway Atoll (NW Hawaiian Chain) and I can honestly say I never met a single Hawaiian sovereignty proponent with a fully functional brain.

Very unfortunate that they have almost certainly killed the prospect of this amazing telescope being built.
Yet the same Democrats that voted this telescopes permit invalid... Ok'd a huge ass ugly cement monorail that cuts across the island of Oahu totally destroying the beauty of their "native" land. Btw...no protests of this monstrosity was ever protested even though the rail project is ruining actual ancient Hawaiian burial sites. Besides...the telescopes are beautiful and it's such an amazing honor to have such wonders of the world here in Hawaii.  The rail is ugly as _____. and absolutely no one likes it and when it opens probably in 2040...no one will use it and we'll still be paying for it.
They already have 13 telescopes on the moutian.  What they should do is replace one of the 13 with the TMT.   Problem solved.
Ancient humans from just about anywhere had a much stronger connection to the night sky than modern humans. If there is one thing they would approve of getting built on their bones it is an astrological observatory. 
&gt; Some Native Hawaiians say that the benefits to astronomy **do not outweigh** the need to respect and protect the natural and cultural environment.

What the fuck do they know? Would they protest it if it was to monitor an incoming asteroid that would spell doom for us? To find a habitable planet within our reach?

Some things are not worth sacrificing in the name of science, a pile of fucking rocks and dirt isn't one of them.
Having lived on the Big Island most of my adult life, I enjoy asking TMT protesters if they are Christian, because most of them say yes. :) Also the only thing I remember any of my friends doing up there is snowboarding and smoking weed. :) VERY SACRED. 
A sacred summit covered in automobiles and protesters sounds more damning than a quiet telescope. 
You've got to be fuckin kidding me right? How would this not being built be a good thing? Screw that sacred site bullshit. It's a telescope on a mountain. The gain of having it far outweighs any nonsense. 
A blow to science, a victory for religion. Poor decision. 
For the uninitiated, such as myself, is there a reason why we need to do this in Hawaii? 
It's not about science vs primitive superstition. It's about indigenous people exercising their right to decide what happens to their land, a land that was stolen from them. 
Well, at least they're not being burned at the stake yet. Luckily, the Gods were not offended.
As long as they bought the land and are not harassing anybody I don't see what right somebody has to deny someone else from building something on his land?
Sadly, because the science community is generally socially progressive and willing to listen, they're going to suffer.  The TMT project has a long history of working with the local government and people, and the University has demonstrated good faith by starting to close down and clean up existing sites, as well as agree to restrict tourism traffic.  But because the science community is actually interested in social responsibility, a great telescope that could be built in an environmentally responsible manner and be an economic and educational boost for the island will be shut down by a tiny, tiny core of protesters.

You won't see them protesting a Wal-Mart or other corporation this way, because Wal-Mart wouldn't even talk to them, wouldn't give them the right to protest on site (which TMT has given them), and also, they happen to like cheap western goods.  So science, which has been a great contributor to the island both economically and intellectually, will be the focal point of a debate about Hawaiian sovereignity, when all they really want to do is be culturally considerate, work hard, and do some astronomy.
another example of cultural tradition getting in the way of scientific progress. 
Are the people so far gone from reality that they consider this a victory? Do they feel the need to hold back all of humanity, in however big or small a manner, for the sake of.... what exactly? Preserving one of the youngest natural formations on the planet? This is like some strange form of new-age SJW crap that instead of just being annoying and nonsensical, is actually having negative effects on scientific progress.
Yeah... didn't the indigenous Hawaiians mine the "holy" mountain during the ancient times ?

Something tells me the majority of protests again the construction of this telescope comes from white people with too much free time...
I just spent a month on the Big Island working on a documentary in which this was a peripheral topic. My opinion changed over the course of the project from incredulity over the opposition of the TMT to siding with the protesters, though for reasons completely unrelated to the spiritual and religious ones often cited, which I find to be silly. The Native Hawaiians have simply been given a raw deal. Their land was taken, their people and culture were greatly reduced, and up until very recently, the Hawaiian language was banned from all schools and public life and as a result, nearly went extinct. And unlike the Native Americans in the US, the Maori in New Zealand, or the Aboriginals in Australia, the Native Hawaiians have received no form of redress from the government. The construction of the TMT, which is 3x the size of the largest scope on the mountain, is simply another insult to their culture, by a government that they view to be an occupying force. And as the article states, it was illegally permitted. From what I understood, there are backup sites for the TMT, which will probably be investigated more closely, as Mauna Kea seems to be too politically and socially fraught. Science will find a way. 
Nobody, and I mean nobody is more pretentiously backwards than a zealous Hawaiian local. 
Headline should read, "The scientifically illiterate defeat science again."

Neil Tyson is crying somewhere...
I am not religious in the slightest, nor superstitious, but I am shocked at the disregard for people's culture regarding this telescope on r/space  ...
That telescope kind of looks like a giant eyeball. Is this coincidence, or does it actually help collect light better?
They are still moving forward with the project on Haleakala.  
Isn't there already approved plans for a public 4.2 gigapixel mega telescope in Chile? 
Compromise; restore seven previously protested but developed sacred sites. Build the instrument.
Am I missing something or does the map show that the summit is nowhere near the proposed site for the TMT?
Hawaii looks chilly in that pic.  It gets chilly in Hawaii?
I love looking at and learning about space, too, but if enough people didn't want this to happen so as to warrant a court ruling against it, then good for the Hawaiians. If they don't want it, then they don't want it. I am capable of respecting the wishes of others when those wishes don't involve hurting others. Sucks for the company making the telescope, though.
If it was bad for locals or environment their it shouldn't have been given permission earlier. Now all the efforts of building it will go in drain. Anyway humans will find some other good place for it. And surely restart the mega telescope observatory development process again. Although right place finding will be a great issue.
Let's not forget that there are already [12](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauna_Kea_Observatories) existing telescope on the mountain.
What better way to be closer to your gods than with a telescope. I go to the big island frequently and the last time I was there I spoke to a native guy about my age (22) and he told me "it would be like building a telescope on Mount Rushmore." It just doesn't make sense. 
I'd like to think if their ancestors advanced to the point where they could peer deep into the heavens that they'd be thrilled to build the telescope at this site.
Does anyone know why they don't install oil style rigs in extremely shallow ocean areas to get the best possible image? Why bother this process. Why not buy a BP pacific nautical oil drill site. I probably havent thought of about 10 billion$ things...
Ellison owns the island of Lanai, a family has owned Niihau for generations. What does sacred mean? Are we not living in a time that will be sacred to a future generation? What better way to honor our time here by literally expanding our understanding of the Universe. We pave over our last remaining farm lands, we put in subdivisions taxing our water table. To me, this is so misguided.
Uh handled this pretty poorly.  And the thing is already out dated.  
I have a lot of family there and was commenting to a local about how cool I thought some of the new wind farms were.  They said they were an eye-sore and should have never been built.  Mind you this is a place with frequent rolling brown-outs and the majority of electricity comes in on a oil tanker to be burned for power.  Unreal.
People need to understand that the opposition of the telescope comes from decades of turmoil and tension between development and local communities. It's not like people have anything against science in particular.
How much money was put into this site?  Can we just move to an alternative?  You will never convince these heretics.
Disappointing. Indian plans for the world's largest neutrino observatory aren't going well either
It would have been the largest telescope in the world. Fuck science.
How can you revoke a permit AFTER work has already began?! What a waste of money. Hopefully there is at least a new site in the planning stages where these parts can be put to use.
The world of astronomy won't end if this telescope isn't built on Mauna Kea.   Astronomers already share telescopes and data all over the globe - the consortium could just as easily build another Chilean one, in equally pristine conditions - this Hawaiian uniqueness is BS.
I just really hope a compromise can be reached. I understand that some people want to respect historical culture and all that, but (as a land lubber from the midwest) the good that the science can do for humanity seems more important.
As a Big Island native, this is so typical of doing business in Hawaii. Between the various racial tensions and factions running a corrupt government aimed at milking federal money for all its worth, and the relentless "pay up for permit then we take it back" (eg. free ports from cancelled super ferry). I am amazed that the telescope construction was even able to get this far!
Why can't they upgrade existing telescopes instead?
You basically need a telescope to see the telescopes are visible from my experience here.
That's just really idiotic. Misplaced militantism. Your island is being bought up by large corporations and overrun by the military, and there's nothing you can do about that -- freedom and freedom, you know, or do you hate freedom? -- so you take it out on *stargazers*?
its not like they are shipping trash to hawaii to load up an island. 
It's not like they're decimating entire regions to build highways and shopping malls. It's a very reasonable amount of land being used for one of the greatest displays of scientific achievement, which simultaneously honours the heritage of the original settlers... This is a huge setback for more than just those directly involved with the project. 
&gt;Notably missing are the Beatles, who reportedly wanted to contribute "Here Comes the Sun" but couldn't secure permission from their record company.

Proving, once again, that record label executives are subhuman bastards.
how great would it be if we received something like this from aliens? "here's what our house looks like!" "here's how we reproduce!" "look at our vehicles!" it's all so adorable.
I love how Anne Druyan (the person in charge of making the "sounds of Earth" record) included the sound of her brainwaves that were recorded when she and Carl Sagan, whom she had worked with for years, suddenly discovered they were madly in love. When they put the things on her head to record the sound, she could only think about her intense happiness about her newfound love. Then, the record was shot into space to drift for millions of years.

How romantic is *that*?
I love the first few slides on the record. Think about how difficult it must have been to think up the most succinct way to encapsulate our number system and to define the physical constants of our world. 

I have always wanted to show these slides to a group of students with no explanation. "Explain what each slide represents." Would they recognize their own solar system? Would they be able to decipher binary code? Do they figure out what the masses and lengths represent in the slides? It would be a fantastic process to watch. 
This is an awesome video, Thanks for sharing it. Kind of really helps you imagine the scale of space and how small we really are.
"In five billion years, All human beings will have become extinct, or evolved into other beings... None of our artifacts will have survived on Earth... And the evolution of the sun will have burned the Earth to a crisp.
And far from home... Untouched by these remote events...
The Voyagers - bearing the memories of a world that is no more - will fly on."

Invokes a beautiful and profound sadness in me... :(

This is an amazingly well done video - enjoyed it thoroughly and it was very informative and interesting. 
The Voyager with the golden record always evokes such a strong ineffable feeling of beauty within me.  I think it is because regardless of whether there are aliens or not, any outcome is deeply poetic. If there are no aliens, then a single compartment summarizing our insignificant existence and achievements is immortalized in the vast emptiness of space. Forever wandering, never to be seen again. But if there are aliens, one may presume eventually that the Voyager will be found. Perhaps many many many years after we are long gone. Either way, it speaks to the magnificence and grand scope of the universe.
Better hope they're not some fish looking species... gonna come here to save what to them looks like the slaughter of children.
We sent unsolicited dick pix into space. I think that may end up being a miscalculation.
[The same in a non-annoying format, and without video advertisement](http://webodysseum.com/art/116-images-of-the-voyager-golden-record/)
This is how aliens got the instructions to create us the first time. It is a never ending cycle!
This fascinates me so much that I had the symbols on the Golden Record tattooed on my arm. 
They must be confident that this info won't be used to enslave or destroy us.
The ending quote is profound:

"Have we destroyed ourselves since the Voyager, or have we gone on to greater things?"
Imagine an alien probe holding similar information crossed our solar system and we got hold of it, and we found out it was over a billion year old. I'll definitely have one of their pictures as my desktop wallpaper! :-) 
I don't understand why NASA wouldn't allow that photo of a nude man and woman? It seems so ridiculous to censor what we actually look like physically and just replace it with a silhouette 
I think one of the most beautiful ironies to this is that we still don't have the technology to find something this small in our own interstellar neighborhood.  If this satellite passed by Earth it would literally have to crash land here for us to notice.

Obligatory [Pale Blue Dot](https://youtu.be/4PN5JJDh78I)  By Sagan.  

God,  that's so fascinating.  Perhaps in a billion years,  some extraterrestrial being will lay eyes on the Golden record -  perhaps the only remnant of us 
I'm confused about the photo credits that appear on the photos. Are those there in reality or is that just for the short presented here? Would this not confuse whatever finds this record that as opposed to the actual labels describing the concepts would they not think the name is what it is known as? When they get to Earth, will they not consider the names on there, gods of our Earth?


I think, it will be more likely that Voyager 1&amp;2 and Pioneer 10&amp;11 will be recovered by future humans than by intelligent aliens from other planets. If humans do not become extinct, some time within the next 40,000 years, we should have the ability to travel fast enough to recover these relics.
    "This is a present from a small distant world,
    a token of our sounds, our science, our images,
    our music, our thoughts and our feelings. We
    are attempting to survive our time so we may
    live into yours. We hope someday, having solved
    the problems we face, to join a community of
    galactic civilizations. This record represents
    our hope and our determination, and our good
    will in a vast and awesome universe."

Lonely bastards those Voyagers... Nobody for millions of miles... Drifting away from home... Slowly getting colder and colder as their hearts grow too weak to power them...
That representative slideshow made me feel a little proud to be minuscule part of humanity.  I'm also glad they included ice cream and grilled cheese.  Obviously our greatest achievements.
Wow some of that stuff is a 2-centimeter-wide spot of pure uranium-238 somewhere on the record.
Wouldn't it be funny is we received one of these capsules, but the species in question had an insane sense of humor? Like everything we found was made for the sole purpose of messing with us? That would be hilarious.

Also, we should give em something pi related. I bet pi is a significant number on other planets as well.
Wow some of that stuff is a little...too informative for an alien race that wants to invade us. On the other hand, I really think we need to send out another golden disk because that shit is so outdated...
I read a manga once called 2001 Nights. In this, the humans had launched a spacecraft similar to Voyager, for the exact same reasons (I may be wrong, been a while since I read it). Through the thousands of years that it travelled through space, mankind developed space technology enough that they eventually caught up to it and overtook it. Hopefully, we'll be able to do something similar one day. Apologies, probably not relevant, but that story left a deep impression on me. 
In 1977, we only had 4 billion people on Earth. Today, we have over 7 billion. 

We need to wrap it up folks.

If alien life ever manages to find us and they discover social media, i think they might glass the planet just to be safe. 
Why was NASA actually faced with backlash for potraying naked humans? THAT'S THE FUCKING ANATOMY OF OUR RACE. 
I've always wondered: what if someone else did this to us and it passed by our planet? What if it burned up in space and we never had a chance to receive it?
While trying to describe ourselves, it seems absurd NASA didn't allow a picture of a naked couple. Don't want to offend the space aliens with our human nudity. 
I know there isn't really an alternative but I don't understand how they expect aliens to make any sense of the diagrams/mathematics etc. because they won't have any frame of reference for it.

Also when the image of the father and sun came up it had the caption 'indicates eyes are for vision' or something like that, all I could think was 'Well if they don't have a concept of eyes how are they going to perceive this image in the first place?'

Still really kool though.
116 pictures, and it's "reported" in video form.
I'm glad Johnny B. Goode is among the musical selection!  

Im just thinking how was it encoded on the disc?
Someone should make a movie about an alien race finding Voyager, and trying to find earth. Maybe they come across an advanced earth, or a completely empty earth. Maybe only a few people still there. Some one better than me could make it good.
&gt; The probe detected high-density plasma characteristic of the space beyond the heliosphere

Why isn't it more of a vacuum?  That's the crap coming at use from other stars and stuff?
“In 5 billion years, all humans will have become extinct, or evolved into other beings.  None of our artifacts will have survived on Earth, and the evolution of the Sun will have burned the Earth to a crisp. And far from home, untouched by these remote events, the Voyagers, bearing memories of a world that is no more, will fly on”

This gave me the chills
&gt; NASA faced a backlash for the nudity of the human figures.

I seriously can't stand these kinds of people. It's our human form for fucks sake. 
Carl Sagan chose to misrepresent humanity by not including images of war, poverty, religion, disease, and crime. Those are ineradicable parts of being human, at least as we are now.

What images would you put in a new golden flash drive to send this year? 

EDIT: Changed disk to flash drive to fit current technology
Absolutely great visualization of the space program that I've always found fascinating. Thanks for sharing! I'm still trying to think of a good way to get a tattoo of some of the designs on the golden record. 

Does anyone know the name of the music track that was playing during the video?
I know there isn't really an alternative but I can't see wanting to flag down other intelligent life when we can fare equivalently in another galaxy.
Am I mistaken or was there no pictures of the Great Pyramids? :(
No https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_Golden_Record Maybe it already has been classified for decades because disclosure of the tech tree.
[Relevant West Wing Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2HzHSeV9v8)
This is super interesting I hope someone finds it and of course comes to earth no to destroy us but to make friendships
I thought copper was a relatively soft metal. They keep talking about how it's durable?
Do they figure out what the masses and lengths represent in the industrial revolution happening without oil.
If I were a world leader in a game of brinksmanship with another country, I would send them the Voyager pictures. Makes life seem more precious and fragile.
"Notably missing are the Beatles, who reportedly wanted to contribute "Here Comes the Sun" but couldn't secure permission from their record company."

GOTTA PREVENT THAT ALIEN PIRACY!
Every time I hear Carl Sagan talk, I get shivers down my spine.
[deleted]
The reason we can continue to extract it using iron age tech.
Why would they put a picture of Andromeda? If the aliens ever came looking for us (assuming they can't track down where Voyager came from), wouldn't they be thrown off by the information of our location that we are giving them?
What I have learned here is if we come across super intelligent fish, the picture of fish and then the picture of fried fish will probably cause intergalactic war.  They will then come here with string-instruments that they assumed were documented weapons of mass destruction only to be eaten by a dog-shaped spaceship.  
  
On a more serious note, do you ever wonder at the rate at which science progresses compared to the rate at which the Voyager moves, society may somehow forget about the craft for long enough that said alien race that discovers it finally will just be us far in the future?

Maybe this is my bias, but I feel jipped that they didn't include two *whole domains* of life (Bacteria and Archaea) and one whole kingdom (Fungi). Sure everyone thinks of humans, plants, and animals, but microorganisms (and fungi) are more numerous than we are!
Havent looked yet, but if Nic Cage isn't in there I am staging protests
Omg, slow down with the slides! I don't have photographic memory like these aliens are assumed to have.
But like what if they don't even have disk players...
No Copyright in Alpha Centuri duh how great would it be if we found something like this from aliens?
The hardest part is the aliens would have to decrypt the images and music and learn how to see them. Whatever image format that was sent may take a long time for them to piece together and figure out. It will likely take them thousands of years to unscramble it. Have you ever opened an image file in notepad or a binary editor? Thats probably what the image will look like to them. They will most likely think its scrambled garbage for the longest time. Who's to even say they have the eye-seeing capabilities that we do? They could all be blind. That's just the image format alone. 

They might think the music format is a different type of image or video. How long will they learn that the music is a sound wave and not just another image type or video? And would they even be able to hear it? Do they have ears? People think that just because this stuff would reach an alien civilization, they'd know what the fuck it is.
Whenever space videos like this or space related speeches are revealed, I can't help but feel so unspeakably emotional. There's something poignant about the vastness and unreachable aspect of space and the possibilities out there that we maybe never comprehend. So seeing these pictures... it's a stark reminder of our existence.
We should offer the aliens the "Skip Ad" button after a few seconds so they don't just nope out of the whole video
On the units slide, I saw avagadros number (6x10^^23 ) but can anyone tell me the significance of 6x10^^27 ?
I'm happy to say I know that with this being out there and other objects we've made within the last hundred years being out there our legacy will never be forgotten. Chances are that one day this thing will float into the arms of another civilization and they will know what this planet is and what we are...gives me a fuzzy feeling inside. How fuckin crazy would it be if we were reincarnated onto other planets and they had technology that could recall past lives and this was in their possession!
“The 116 photos NASA picked to explain Our World to Aliens”
Some say a picture speaks a thousand words. Yet explaining humanity to extra-terrestrials just may not be possible, using images of what we do best and worst. So hopefully they will bring with them the technology, extra sensory mind reading ability, to capture and assimilate the following:
Believer: Someone unwilling/unable to share, that infallible methodology they personally used to confirm some certainty to their own mind.
Atheist: Someone claiming possession, of that all-knowing capability entirely exclusive to an entity that apparently does not exist.
Such that they then understand us better than we understand ourselves. 

I'd love to know if anything secret was put on there that only a select few knew about. Tongue in cheek or otherwise.

Who actually shot JFK
Tesla's classified works
Dick pics

It is an amazing video. Kind of truly helps you think of the scale of space and how little we actually are.
Well, the first image seems to describe our world pretty well: http://imgur.com/0d45ARU
I'm in the middle of writing a science fiction novella about Voyager 1. This should be useful. Thanks OP.
Some distant alien: "Mmmmm ... tasty looking.  I wonder if they're still there?"
Unfortunately they chose to block the video in the UK (the player appears to be stuck when loading but plays when connected through a US VPN).
Two pictures of the UN building? They're going to recognise that as significant and it'll be the first place the land/blow up
The problem is.. Aliens wont have retinas developed to see our light spectrum on earth. 
It's really heavy to think that this record may outlast humanity as a whole. It could eventually end up being the last, and only record of our existence. Fuck
What if a powerful alien civilization sends a golden record to earth with 116 images of the various slaughters and genocides they've done on other alien civilizations as a response to ours.
This is all very interesting, to think that some aliens may one day long in the future look at these same images, and listen to the same stuff I am hearing right now. I wonder what they would think--if they would find Bach beautiful. That is all, of course, assuming that Voyager doesn't smash full fucking speed into their atmosphere and disintegrate into little tiny pieces and be unusable. 
It would be better if they recorded a simpstons episode to show them
If anyone wants more info on the subject: http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/goldenrec.html
I can only imagine that if a race only as technologically advanced as ours saw voyager from their planet, they'd see it as a new star for many generations, then one day they actually see it change position in the sky. More time passes, and it moves faster across their sky. Eventually they realize it's a satellite. The time of unintentional discovery and realization would be staggering. Some paradigm would probably be made where they fully believed it was a fast and distant star, then it just passed them
The first one looks like Louis C.K. eating a grilled cheese sandwich.  (IMG 82 in the video)

I watched this video while listening to Them Shoes by Patrick Sweany and the overlay was really cool.  I suggest it.  It sent chills down my spine.  Maybe try overlaying some other songs too, it seemed pretty cool.
Maybe off-topic but does anybody  know who  the background musician is?
How odd, something so insignificant in space will outlast a collective species capable of travelling in the vaccum of space. Yet that is the closest thing we will ever know to immortality.
The subject on the left of the thumbnail photo looks deliciously ambiguous. 
At 0:50 did they use to think Pluto has a diameter of 14000 km or am I understanding it wrong?
How do we know they'll even be able to listen to what's on there? Or that they'll even be able to understand our language and numerals? I mean, I know math is universal, but their script for numbers may be something we can't even comprehend and vice versa.

There is something so incredibly calming about Carl Sagan's voice. I really need to go re-watch Cosmos 
That picture appears to show a woman licking a penis. Is this the image of Earth we want to promote, galactically?
But what if the aliens aren't friendly?  This is an incredible oversight.
Could be turned into th basis of an alien tresure hunting movie. Just need a title. 
I'm struck by the difference in the world between 1977 and now... technology has changed the world in so many ways since then. I wonder what kind of images/sounds we would send up now...
Just imagine the next one we send up will have videos...  with advertisements!
Show the Aliens our anatomy, and show them our resources. Teaching them to wipe us out and steal our resources. Lol
Anyone have an album so I don't have to keep pausing the video?
Think they are still going on somewhere out there? Are they being tracked at all?
What a concept for a movie! Aliens find golden record, socialize it in their planet, people in the pictures become celebrities, aliens set out to find earth ...something dramatic happens...something is resolved. The end. Part 2..
When humans first started exploring and traveling all over the world (i.e. when Europeans came to America), millions died from new diseases that their ethnic groups had not evolved to cope with - and that was within our own species... Don't you think if we find life - even if they are peaceful - outside of our *solar system* the results would be catastrophic? For both sides?
If I was intelligent life (alien) and I viewed a picture here I would assume that Earthlings are ENORMOUS creatures. And judging by the simplicity of these pictures, that Eagle would like literally terrifying as if it was the size of a 2 story building...
One of the first things said on the record is: "We step out of our solarsystem seeking only peace and friendship". Has there ever been peace on Earth while humans existed? How many species have become extinct because of us? How long can Earth stay alive with humans around? 

Alien races would be wise to stay well clear of human beings.
Just imagine what a modern day GoProbe® could carry into space. How's the shelf life for Red Bull?
There's something so hauntingly beautiful about this. I suppose it's the aspect of hope; hope that the Voyager will find something/someone, hope that they will understand how to decode our messages, hope that they will like us. 
When I was in high school circa 1980 I did a relief painting of the "MAN WITH DOG" picture shown at 3:01. The art instructor, a guy named Jon Corby who was a good friend of one of my older brothers, kept it as part of his collection of work of his students that he kept on this big wall in the studio, which was considered quite an honor at the time. I always think of that painting whenever the pictures that went up the Voyager missions comes up.
This is an amazingly well done video - enjoyed it thoroughly and it was very informative and interesting. 
They now have all they need to invade us. 
https://media.giphy.com/media/13ea4eXuOuQsmY/giphy.gif
Wait until they show up, and there are almost twice as many people as we said there were on this planet.
No alphabet.  Mathematical definitions using the equals sig... but no explanation of that the equals sign is.
So we basically gave all the info they would need to imitate, find our weaknesses, and eventually destroy us. 
If a spacecraft similar to Voyager from another solar system were to pass near or through our solar system, would we notice it?
I just find it especially amazing that the President of the United States wrote this to the hypothetical aliens that might find our Voyager. 

"This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings. We are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours. We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations. This record represents our hope and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe." 

Imagine coming into work one day and being told that you need to make a statement to the beings that might find our craft. Wow. 
The continental drift will probably be a little different due to rising sea levels unaccounted for, no? 
The video says that "in 5 million years, humans will be extinct or evolved into other beings". Is that really a logical statement? Evolution happens over hundreds of millions of years, so if we had evolved into something else within 5 million years we'd be something *very* close to what we are now. Also it's my opinion that our evolution is halted because we are no longer subject to natural selection. Our modern luxuries and technologies have made it so that our physical and mental shortcomings are not a life and death situation. I'd love to hear about why I'm wrong about this

Edit: He said 5 billion. Not 5 million
I know this may sound like a strange question but whenever I read about the Voyager probes I actually have to make an effort not to well up. Does anyone else get this? I don't usually cry about anything.

Here, Commander Hadfield has you covered. On the ISS, you get a little closet type private cabin, you can turn off the lights, and apparently it's hella comfy. Check out the modern space jammies. We've come a long way since the Shuttle.
I thought you could at least have the lights off... damn that would kinda suck.
You know this is going to turn into some sort of spa treatment for the rich one day. 
I think it's weird that our bodies default position to go to is our arms out in front of us rather than down at our sides. 
The only thing creepy to me is that somebody was recording them as they slept. 
They all have fans blowing at their faces because otherwise all the carbon dioxide they exhale will stay around their face and they will suffocate.  I fucking love science. 
I wonder what it's like to wake up in zero gravity. Do you feel the same heaviness and the need to stretch, or do the effects of weightlessness on your circulation allow you to wake up spry as a kitten?
During the Apollo missions, astronauts reported random flashes of bright light when they closed their eyes. Turns out, it was cosmic rays hitting their retina and creating bright flashes.

So during an Apollo mission, even with all the lights off and your eyes closed there would be random bright flashes of light every few minutes that you could never escape keeping you awake.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_visual_phenomena
In space you need excellent air circulation around your face or when you breathe out, you can create a CO2 bubble that envelopes your head and you could suffocate. Air flow prevents the bubble from sticking to your face/head
But what if you drool a lot? You'd have a big spit orb floating around in front of your face.
As someone who has a wife with muscular dystrophy and has to turn her from side to side several times per night due to how sore she gets, this looks amazing. As she has always said, "Gravity is my worst enemy."
Aside from not being good at math or engineering or being a skilled pilot, I think the thing keeping me from being an astronaut is not being able to sleep like that.
It's interesting how they're strapped in.  I toss and turn something fierce when I sleep.  I figure if those restraints weren't there, astronauts would be sleep-tumbling around the room.

Come to think of it, that would be even more creepy to watch, bodies suspended in air, rotating at various speeds, curled up in half-fetal positions, with their eyes closed.  Imagine one of them snoring.  Do you think the propulsion from their exhalations would act like a booster rocket, moving them slowly about the room as they gently twisted in space?  It would be like Brownian motion.
I always assumed the lights would be out during sleep periods.
I spoke with a retired astronaut once whIle waiting for arriving astronauts at Ellington. He said you wake up stiff as a mummy, because you can't shift around against your weight. You  have to loosen up in sections when you wake, like stretching for working out.

Reason's I could not be an astronaut -

1. Can't sleep in the light.

Interesting; it looks a bit like a fencing response.  Since they are unconscious, I wouldn't be surprised if it was or was related.
I was waiting for one of their eyes to pop open and the alien inside their chest to begin poking out.
Anyone else thinking this would cause you to have messed up dreams? 
[Looks like bad cases of fencing response...](https://gfycat.com/IncompleteGrayArachnid)
Yeesh, I hope none of them snored.

Come to think of it, would zero-g effect snoring?
I wonder if spending an extended period of time in zero gravity would begin to have an effect on one's dreams. I used to have those dreams in which I would be falling, falling and then startle awake right before hitting the ground. Would those go away?
Why are some standing while others are lying? Do they take turns, is it for medical reasons?
Never crossed my mind until now that pillows wouldn't be needed in space..
At first I thought "wouldn't it be uncomfortable sleeping straight up like that," then I realized there is no up or down in space. 
I always sleep with the fan on. Would a fan work in space or on a space ship?
The guy with his arms up looks like he fell asleep reading a pretend newspaper and never put his arms down.
what happens when you drool? we all drool when we sleep, so when they wake up are there balls of drool floating around? and yes this video is very weird.
how can they stand sleeping with the lights on like that?  It bugs me when I get just a little bit of glow coming in from the street lights outside my apartment. 
What happens if you want to sleep on your stomach? 
What happens if they dribble in their sleep? Is there any chance of it getting into the electrickery?
D'awww.. that one guy looks just like our baby when she sleeps in her armless snuggie!
Why did they need so many people on shuttle missions, like up to 7? The station only has 6. 
Don't worry. No one's creeping in on that space-based slumber party.
Must be a little difficult to get use to galling asleep like that. 
I could never sleep like that...too much light.
While my view of the video was accompanied by a whiskey add so I just assumed they were drunk.
What's the difference between this and how they sleep in Interstellar? 
I feel like having a panic attack just looking at that.
I knew that to be an Astronaut you had to have a competitive mindset...I didn't realize they all suffered from [Sleep fighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl-qkPXvtfI)
I think the propulsion from their exhalations would act like a dream come true to me.
Maybe they do, but on this occasion the lights were turned on so we can see what's going on.
can't tell if this would be extremely comfortable or not at all..
I don´t why, but this made me think about the first "Alien" movie :S
Was this STS-41D? The dude with the white hair looks like Henry Hartsfield and my best guess is that the guy with the mustache is Charlie Walker?
It seemed unusual to sleep upright at first, but the human body doesn't have a sense of directionality in space, right?  Without gravity, can your inner ear tell you the positioning of your body as you sleep?  And when you wake up, there must be a huge sense of disorientation because you swim out of your sleeping quarters and everything is sideways.
question, how is the digestive system effected by zero gravity? Like is it different for the stomach acid in our stomachs? or is it business as usual?
I wonder, is sleeping in a weightless environment more or less comfortable than sleeping in a comfy bed? 
Holy shit, I accidentally reported this, I'm on a phone and was trying to save it! I'm sorry!
Is it too technologically difficult to have the ISS rotate to create artificial gravity? In 20 or so years I'm sure it will be standard up there. 
Do they report getting a good night's sleep? and when sleeping standing up 
in the bag, do they feel that they are lying down?  And do them dream?
I bet if you rotated it 90 degrees counterclockwise it would only look half as creepy. Someone plz reddit needs you for science!
Is it difficult to adjust to sleeping in space? I would think it would be difficult to adjust since idk how achievable the "laying down to bed" feeling is in space, but then again I don't have a lot of knowledge on this subject
Random spittle clouds, drool pockets, farts smell like applesauce squeezers.

Can someone flip this upside down - I think it would be way creepier.
filmed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt trying to come with an idea for the kick.
Ok. Legit question,  how would they masturbate? Also what happens with male and female there?
Does zero-g have any kind of effect on dreams, or sleep for that matter? Like for example when you jolt yourself awake when your brain thinks your falling? I feel like that kind of thing might happen a lot more frequently when you're asleep while you're floating. Unless zero-g sleep is the most peaceful kind of sleep you can possibly have.
Imagine if for some strange reason you did not have to sleep when In space. I bet it would allot more people would be in space - along with my space stations for 24/7 studies 
The one crew member is being attacked by purple alien plague! Somebody save him!
Must be very uncomfortable to sleep strapped in with a group of other people and intense lights on...
Creepy to be sleeping in the light, with your face to exposed.... da fuck?
Why would they sleep? I thought the missions only lasted a few hours?
What's it like to rub one out in zero gravity? I'm really really Really curious...
I think I would lose my mind if I weren't able to put my arm underneath the pillow that my head is laying on
what's the sense of orientation in zero G? if you're "upside down" do you feel the blood rush to your head? do your limbs get tired or uncomfortable just floating there? can you sleep in basically any position and feel the same because there's no gravity?
It does look like rigor mortise.

(I saw rigor mortise when I identified my grandmother, who died in a nursing home.)
I just picture a deep voice saying something like: Their bodies were found tied up, silently floating, peace at last, after the torment they endured. Lmao, creepy looking indeed. 
Well, that settles it. The natural, unimpeded resting position of our arms is apparently a comical "put your dukes up" pose. 
I have it on good authority that the first thing you notice upon entering the ISS is it absolutely reeks of body odors.  
That can't be comfortable, not to mention how horrible it would be to try and fall asleep in full light.

Former optics intern here, my company worked on the lenses for Curiosity and New Horizons, this is a pretty standard procedure called "Pitch Lap Polishing."

Essentially, the round blackish pad thing you see is made from pitch, and will have channels cut into the bottom.  While, in some cases, the pad does touch the surface of the part, it's actually that white liquid you see going the heavy work.  There are rare earth minerals suspended in that, and they are extremely fine abrasives.  

As the pad passes over the surface, each pass takes off a micron or so of material.  Think about that: a human hair is about 100 microns in diameter.  

We regularly worked within tolerances of +/- 0.005 microns for part radius, and JWST being the way it is, they may work in tolerances of +/-0.001 microns.  Opticians do incredible work.
I took a tour of an optics company that was working on a mirror of the JWST(yes I got to see it) and they said 

"if the mirror was stretched to the diameter of the earth, the biggest difference in height between any two dimples/peaks on the mirror would be less than 1 meter." 

That's how flat the mirror

blew my mind

Edit:  "JWST’s mirrors are so flat that if you stretch them all out across the United States, "the largest bump would be no bigger than two inches. That’s how smooth these mirrors are"  [-Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore]( http://m.space.com/17202-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-mirrors.html)

Anyone with any interest in the history of ground-based astronomy should read Ronald Florence's *The Perfect Machine* about the funding, planning and manufacture of the 200-inch Hale Telescope at Palomar.

Grinding of the glass blank began in 1936, continuing through early 1942 when WWII shut down the project:

&gt; Work began every day at 8:00 a.m. Everyone who worked in the optics lab changed into a white shirt and trousers, cotton hospital uniforms, and canvas sneakers. At lunch they changed out of the uniforms, ate from brown bags, and played handball outside and then changed back into the uniforms for four more hours of the routine. There were no breaks.

&gt; The obsession with cleanliness in the optics shop was more than many men could stand. The floors were swept and washed daily. A worker rolled a magnet over the floor daily, sometimes several times a day, to pick up even tiny specks of metal. If a speck was found it was put into an envelope, and the search began for the culprit machine.

&gt; Mostly the deadly routine got to men. The machines were huge, driven by electric motors big enough to power a large lathe or milling machine. Despite the size of the machines, glass can only be worked slowly. Removing millimeters of glass can take months of slow grinding. In the later stages of work, removing fractions of a millimeter can take years ... Week after week each day was exactly like the one before - tending a machine, performing a routine task, like feeding carborundum into a funnel-hopper on a grinding tool, sloshing the carborundum-water slurry over the face of the disk, or even sitting, perched, for hours at a stretch, on a scaffold platform under the big disk-grinding machine, greasing a drive gear by hand to make certain the drive mechanism did not gall. The unchanging routine, coupled with the fear that a single lapse could destroy a priceless disk, was more than many men could stand. Marcus Brown [the Caltech optics lab supervisor of the process] said, "Time is worth less than glass around here."

&gt; The surface of the disk had to be washed completely each afternoon, lest water left on the disk etch the glass ... 

&gt; The grinding was tedious. The coarse carborundum grated as the iron grinding tool turned. The iron, in turn, reverberated the noise into a screech. Conversation was impossible. From the first days of the work, Brownie (Marcus Brown) calculated that they would need five tons of carborundum to remove the two and a half tons of glass on the surface of the disk. Five tons was a lot of screeching ...

&gt; Though it seemed an eternal job that would leave everyone in the optics shop permanently deaf, the surface grinding finally halted in the spring of 1937 ...

&gt; Corning had cast a 40-inch Pyrex disk to fill the center hole in the mirror disk during the grinding of the mirror. Trueing the plug to a perfect circle was a relatively simple task, but Anderson had to think awhile to come up with a scheme to lower the 1,400-pound plug into the hole in the disk [so it would seat precisely for the polishing] ... Anderson had Brownie's workmen place a large cake of ice, tall enough to support the plug, in the hole in the disk. The crane lowered the plug in place onto the ice, the lifting frame was removed, and as the ice slowly melted, the plug slipped into its exact fit in the disk. For optical lab workers, used to watching miniscule progress after a day or a week of polishing a mirror, watching ice melt wasn't boring. A room full of workmen exhaled all at once as the plug settled into place without harming the mirror.

&gt; In the summer of 1937 Brownie and his crew began shaping the mirror: Day after day the same small crew of workmen in white cotton surgical suits and canvas shoes worked the big machine. Occasionally they traded jobs. Usually regularity was more important: The same man did the same job each day. One man stood on a scaffold under the machine, greasing the main gears for the turntable to make certain they didn't gall. Another man continuously washed the edges of the disk with a hose, sloshing away the excess grinding slurry. A man stood by the power switch in case of an emergency. The seventeen-and-one-half-foot-diameter table of the grinding machine turned slowly. The disk was so large that at a rotating speed of one-half turn per minute, the outer edge moved by the grinding tool at twenty-six feet per minute.

&gt; Hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month, the disk turned, while the grinding tool above turned in its own serpentine lissajous figures. Occasionally the routine was interrupted so they could change the glass blocks on the face of the tools. Every few months they would change the grinding tool, from the one-third- and half-size tools to the full-size tool, a disk as large as the mirror itself. A sharp-eyed visitor might notice a slight change in the configuration of the machine. Most visitors would watch for a few minutes, amazed that men could work hour after hour, day after day, doing the same job, in the same windowless room, with the same droning machines, and without seeing any progress in their work.

&gt; The concave shape Brownie and his men were grinding into the disk would be approximately three and three-quarter inches deep at the center of a two-hundred-inch-diameter circle. It would take months before the curve was apparent to the naked eye. The men in the room stopped guessing how long it would take to grind and polish the mirror to the approximately one-millionth-of-an-inch precision the final figure would require.


And then, the re-opening of the optics shop after the war:

&gt; Next door to the machine shop, in the optical shop, Marcus Brown had been counting the days until he could return to his work ... In September 1945 Brownie and his crew - only a few men were veterans of the prewar telescope work - lifted off the timbers that had protected the mirror disk for three years.It took them three months to clean the entire optics shop with magnets, hoses, scrub brushes, and magnifying glasses.

&gt; Most of the men were new, but the rhythm of figuring the mirror on the huge polishing machine returned quickly. For five days each week, Monday through Friday, Brownie and his crew would polish zones of the disk, bringing the surface closer to the elusive perfect figure. On Saturday, John Anderson and Brownie would test the disk, studying the shadows of the knife-edge to find zones that would need more attention on the polishing machine. Day after day, week after week, the polishing went on.

The mirror, cast at Corning in 1934-1935 and ground at Caltech between 1936 and 1947, left the Caltech optics shop in November of 1947.

[Florence's book is available at Amazon.](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XVN10S/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1)

It also contains fascinating accounts of the politics of getting funding, the fascinating character of George Hale, the casting at Corning (including the wet-year flood which almost destroyed the mirror) and the design of the bicycle-wheel oil-filled bearings which allow the multi-ton apparatus to be moved by a 1/2-horsepower motor.
Fun fact about the JWST... It doesn't orbit the Earth. Instead, it orbits the sun along the same path as the earth. It basically follows the planet around like a baby duckling.
I just tried cleaning my mirrors with milk and it didn't work nearly as well.
Somehow I don't believe it. While the machine does this finely tuned motion and some sort of polisher/cleaner is added, the technician with full face hair just stands there breathing his snot all over it and leaving scratches. I have never seen anything that's going on a satellite, being build in a non clean room. 
I'm in the middle of grinding a mirror for a science fair project. Man I wish I had one of those machines XD
Billions of dollars, no expense spared and then Lenny from maintenance polishes the surface of the mirrors. Ok.
[deleted]
I was sure I was going to open this to see Mr. Miyagi hard at work making some kid doing the polishing
The guy standing next to it is the DJ of the mirror polishing world. Standing there pretending to make music/polish mirrors.
I make lenses for glasses I'd imagine my polisher and finer, while much smaller, probably do roughly the same thing.
Is there a James web subreddit yet?   I'd like to see stuff just about it . 
I can't belive they let that guy have a beard next to that thing. Usually facilities where they make thing like that are soooo clean.
Remember to account for Earth's gravitation this time... thanks!
The thumbnail looks like a lake covered in ice on a cool winter night and the rest looks like the night sky and lights of in the distance 
How are they going to test the mirrors for readiness? Was there not a news story years about about the surface of the bubble mirrors needing to be repolished due to some flaw?
It's fascinating stuff, but it looks pretty grim.
Good luck to them and the diamond abrasives in the fluid flow.
What does that sign say? "Something something black vacuum hose."
Does anyone know what type of polishing slurry they're using during this process?
A little surprised that the guy is not wearing a bunny suit
That man is so focused. You can see the concentration in his eyes.
The properties of mercury are amazing, i love physics!
I'm more excited for this project then I was for Christmas at age 10, or for Fallout 4, or when I went on my first date. I cannot wait to see what new discoveries and images this magnificent piece of work brings us in the coming decades.
This is where Perkin Elmer fucked up while making mirror for Hubble. 
That's either the greatest mirror of all time, or someone's going waaaaaay too overboard with his custom Catan hexes. 
This is what I imagine A.I. will watch and consider old timey robot porn in the future. 
ELI5 how the liquid wouldn't simply float off if this entire process were to be repeated in space.
I remember going to see some talk about this at a university near my home when I was really little. (I think younger than 10?) I didn't know it hadn't launched by now. 
I'd love to see the source video for this!
I'm at the company that makes it.
Is there a longer video of this?
I watched this for way too long without realizing it was looping. [4]
Good luck to them and the diamond abrasives in the fluid flow.
The diameter of each segment is about 3 PICOmeters over the face of the disk, studying the shadows of the university optics lab.
Update on this: The first of our 18 primary mirrors was just installed onto the telescope. Its happening!

I didn't know Kevin Smith has a brother that makes mirrors for telescopes
So let me get this right.... They polish the mirror by rubbing it intensely while a lot of tentacles are ejaculating slimy fluid on it? Hmm... I think there are some anime fans on that science team.....
The sprayer nearest the camera appears to be wasting all of it's fluid. Shouldn't it be spraying toward the buffer? 
yea let's hope they are not going to fuck this one up like the hubble 
All i could think was japanese tenticle porn...internet has ruined me
So people with beards have to wear a hair net when preparing my food but not next to a multi-million dollar mirror...
I'm thinking for something like this, you really should be building a spare, just in case.   There's nothing worse than launching a very expensive space telescope and watching its launcher blow up.   Best to have a backup!   Just sayin'!

So, when we get another hubble-style fuckup, we know who to blame.
The gif/video is pretty crap (for the average viewer), but I'm (now) really looking forward to the images that's going to come out of the JWST. Good luck to them and the launch, holding thumbs.
" And while the experimental physicists have flailed about in the dark searching for dark matter, theoretical physicists have turned to their computer simulations"

This is a pretty bad misrepresentation of experimental dark matter hunters.  With the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope we can exclude many prime dark matter suspects (theories, specifically thermal relic WIMPS with mass below 100 GeV).  Sure we don't see a signal, but in those models one was predicted to exist and you don't know if the model is correct or not until you look
Three questions, if anybody can answer:

1. How would you know in which direction to look?

2. Wouldn't the concentration caused by the sun be absolutely huge, to the point where we might be able to notice lensing effects?

3. Same as above, but applied to more massive stars in our galaxy.

Could a person and/or spacecraft run into dark matter? And what would happen if that occurred? 
How dense would the roots need to be to be detectable by the gravitational effects on spacecraft, e.g. STEREO, etc? via Doppler shifting of their signals? Seasonality?
&gt; According to his modeling, Prézeau said such roots would likely be around 1 million km away from Earth, or more than twice the distance of the Moon. Identifying the location of such a “root” would make a juicy target for a probe to detect and characterize dark matter, which has so far eluded scientists.

If anyone's wondering (like I was) NASA already have a probe orbiting 1.5 million kilometres from the Earth, the [Deep Space Climate Observatory] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Space_Climate_Observatory), which is where those cool photos of the moon passing in front of the Earth came from. Sadly, it doesn't look like it has any kind of "Dark Matter Detector" on board.
What if "dark matter" (we could refer to it as the missing mass of the universe, or simply continue to use the phrase "dark matter" because it sounds so really cool), the missing mass of the universe, inhabits the "space" we are in (let's call it "real space") but is separated from real space so that while it can affect real space, it's not apparent in real space.
Silly question. Aren't the motions of planets in our solar system following the physics predicted by combining Newton and Einstein to several decimal places? Like, we can shoot a microwave oven-sized space craft at Jupiter and have it go into orbit around one of its moons using gravitational theory that lacks massive amounts of solar-system dark matter. Wouldn't all this dark matter affect the orbits of planets and space crafts just like it is affecting the galactic orbits of stars? 
There may already be evidence that is compatible with the "clumps of dark matter may lie just beyond the Moon" hypothesis.

Over the last decade, several probes which used Earth gravity assist in their trajectory, have shown a small amount of unexplained acceleration during 5 out of 6 of their flybys.  See: http://www.space.com/5037-nasa-baffled-unexplained-force-acting-space-probes.html

Further analysis of the available data may provide clues to where to look for potential dark matter clumps.


Just want to thank all the people smarter and more educated than I providing so many answers in this thread. It's been a fascinating read. I really appreciate this community.
"There is no dark side of the moon really.
Matter of fact it's all dark."

If 1% of all stellar black holes were intermediate mass (100,000 solar masses) that would explain all dark matter.

As we figure out what dark matter is, the aliens decloak and reset their experiment.
Could dark matter be the natural density and combinations of gases that exist in space and, like logs in a river, create eddies and turbulences that work to bind galaxies together?

I thought the whole point of dark matter was to reconcile extra gravity.  Haven't people kind of already figured out how everything in the solar system works without needing dark matter?  Isn't dark matter for deep space?  I'm guessing I'm missing a ton of information...
Dark matter effects gravity right?  Shouldn't we easily see the gravitational effect of this?  Maybe I am not properly understanding dark matter? 
Photino Birds god dammit.  Every time!!!!  Where are the Xeelee when you need them!
But how can one say that the dark matter is located behind the moon, which revolves around the earth, which revolves around the sun, would WE on earth move away from the location of the dark matter? Or would it rotate/revolve with us as we move?
Dark matter sounds to me, a layman, as something like aether or the (hypothesized) planet Vulcan. It seems like we are making up stories and descriptions about something with no evidence. And there seems like there could be lots more explanations for the missing mass than some exotic material. If there is dark matter keeping the galaxy together, shouldn't there be dark matter holding the solar system together? Or what about holding the moon in orbit around earth? Wouldn't our models about these orbits have to take dark matter into consideration? 
Is it still possible that there is a yet to be discovered nuance of gravitation or relativity that compensates for what we currently call dark matter? My motivation for asking is that it seems very similar to the previous century's search for the luminiferous ether. Or does this analogy break down somehow?
I've got it you guys.  The aliens, being eons ahead of us in technology have found a way to convert complex structures into a stable dark matter state.  Then, knowing humans were not yet advanced enough to accurately detect anomalies in dark matter, they began observing the planet earth as an unnoticed and undisturbing presence.

Soon they became complacent with their earth observation station.  "Ahh, they're still burning carbon, they're nowhere close to detecting our station.  We've got a few more centuries at least."

Then this story is beamed aboard the station and back to the closest communication beacon where an earth communicatiobs operator stops watching a Brazilian soap opera and spits his space coffee all over the screen.

"Shit!  They're like 5 years from figuring it out and they're still murderous barbarians!  Get that station out of there!"
Could dark matter possibly be multi dimensional (specifically more than 3 dimensional) and this is the reason we're having such a hard time finding it?
And why just beyond the moon? Surely it doesn't create a perfectly spherical shielding effffect or am I totally wrong?
With all the effort that has been and will be put into detecting dark matter, I wonder if it may be that dark matter is the phlogiston of the 21st century.
I don't understand why dark matter can be so pervasive as to lead to the dramatic changes in the rotational speed of stars within galaxies but we don't see any corresponding deviation in the orbital velocities of the planets within our solar system. I recall a study of the tracking of the pioneer probes and the minuscule deviations from predictions that had resulted. Surely if dark matter is so widespread wouldn't we have seen major deviations from prediction? Any ideas???
There's some absurdity to the amount of dark matter certain galaxies require to conform to certain Newtonian or general relativity predictions. I have a strong feeling there are many principles in physics that have yet to be discovered to explain these discrepancies, so dark matter and dark energy may not be the right hypothesis.
Can someone eli5 what specifically is dark matter and what this means?
Do WIMPs interact with gravity? I thought the who idea was they only interact through the weak (or in extreme conditions electroweak) force. Can't they have mass that only interacts with the weak field?

Also, if there is dark matter affecting gravity in the solar system, wouldn't we see that in our highly complex intrastellar spaceship travels? Wouldn't thee be other factors throwing off trajectories outside of regular n-body models?
Should we be looking at black holes as a potential source? It seems as though dark matter could be partially responsible for holding galaxies together, so is it ridiculous to think that the black hole "spins a Web of dark matter" throughout a galaxy as its contents are spewed out, or do we have a pretty good idea of the radiation that exits them?
I can't open the article for some reason. Can someone give me a TL;DR including how far exactly "just beyond" is?
Stupid question.... but something that dense would have an impact on the moon's orbit, no? Causing an elliptical path, or a wobble, or something?
What density are they talking about in this context? Is it the typical m/v ? If so how much?
I wonder how hard and how much money would be needed to put a probe (with the right tools) in that patch of spacetime. 
dark matter railways that would be cool, not sure if possible at all but came to mind
Is it possible that science is wrong about dark matter/energy and the theories are now self supporting without evidence?

Are there other fields of study explaining gravity and the way universe appears to work that don't postulate dark matter/energy?
Without looking any farther than the title, I can't help but feel this is just what a scientist might say if they really really just want to go back to the moon.    
"I swear, it's Dark Matter everywhere there man, all we have to do is set up a base in the Sea of Tranquility!"
There's an alien base on the other side of the moon, of course, and they use the dark matter for interstellar travel. Duh.
Finally, something big in astronomy that isn't light years away
We see the intergalactic dust outside the net masses of the universe show that, for everything to work and move the way we see that in our highly complex intrastellar spaceship travels You must be from a different solar system.
So, stupid question.  What does it mean for us having it there in what I would assume it's a large amount?
and see I though you still lived with your mom. Now we know, shes over the moon.
Until dark matter proves to be useful, is it safe to say that computer modelling is much cheaper than building something expensive that may not work, prove, or even disprove a theory.?
So this might be a dumb question but if we somehow collected a sample of dark mater and held it right in front of our face, is it something we could see or touch?
How do they separate matter that doesn't reflect light such as rogue planets without suns out in the middle of nowhere without a galaxy?
What are the alternate theories to dark matter for explaining the apparently too weak gravity field responsible for holding the galaxy together. Only it seems like scientists are really flogging a dead horse with dark matter.
Do we even know if it is matter at all? My understanding is that "dark matter" is what we call our incorrect calculations for gravity in the universe. We observe more gravity than we calculate that we should observe.
It turned out that his theory was simply describing the problem for Einstein to have enough mass to effect an object through gravity.
Anything is possible when you use terms like "May" and "up to".

dozens of beautiful women **may** lie just beyond my back door, and my student debt will prob take **up to** 1000 times longer to payoff then i'd hoped for
Does anyone know the arxiv reference for this paper?
Is it something we might use?  maybe worth going out and mining?
Yeah, we are missing when it comes to physics and we have no idea how to explain that.
Request a TL;DR??

like what does all of this dark matter mean? good shit/bad shit?
Such a situation would be getting a lot of mass just like any other particle, which will be added to the point of dark matter state.
Normal matter when attracted by gravity, even when it comes to physics and we invented this construct to compensate.
A really good documentaries on YouTube on dark matter, and all of the spokes in the wheel.
Could a person and/or spacecraft run into dark matter? And what would happen if that occurred? 
Something tells me this title is somehow an inaccurate portrayal of the contents of the article.
do we have any evidence that it exists at all? It doesn't seem to interact with the rest of the universe, so how do we know it actually exists?
I still think most dark matter is neutrino mass, just as photons can form psuedo bonds, so does travelling clumps  of nuetrino mass, that and the weird 3 body interaction thing I have read about but don't remember it's name/. 


Therefore there's more mass than some exotic material.
Normal for what? For 'the other side of moons'? For 'within 1 astronomical unit of a main-sequence star'?
You're getting a bit ahead of us in technology have found a way to shed velocity.
We're not doing that yet in this 2 body system, but it was found recently to be to be believed.
The Five Unknowns by Richard Lieu from University of Alabama in Huntsville.
1. Galaxy redshifts, explained as "expansion of space".
2. Cosmic microwave background radiation, explained as the afterglow of the "big bang"
3. Perceived motion of stars in the disks of spiral galaxies, explained by "dark matter"
4. Distant supernovae dimmer than expected, hence an accelerating universe, explained by "dark energy"
5. Flatness and isotropy, explained by "inflation".
"There is no way to interact and get a response from the Universe to test the theory under question, like an experimentalist might do in a laboratory experiment. At most the cosmologist collects as much data as he can and uses statistical arguments to try to show that his conclusion is likely. Hence the promise of using the Universe as a laboratory from which new incorruptible physical laws may be established without the support of laboratory experiments is preposterous..."

The first two scientists who discovered the evidence of a galaxy rotation problem known as the missing mass problem was Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1932, and Swiss astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky. Fritz calculated the discrepancy needed 400 times more mass that was observed. So the presence of dark matter was inferred.

The Electric Universe hypothesis says the electrical state of matter forms the systems we see in space. This is considered pseudo-science by standard model of cosmology adherents, yet with each new discovery they are always surprised. Study the EU hypothesis in depth before you make up your own mind. It's better to be informed of both theories completely and prepared to argue your stance objectively. 


&gt; Physicists have sought these clumps for decades, but because dark matter interacts only weakly with normal matter, it has proven difficult to detect. 

This article isn't terribly well written, in parts. More accurate would be

&gt; Physicists have sought these clumps for decades, but haven't been able to detect it. Because the theoretical framework predicting dark matter is very reliable otherwise and no acceptable viable alternative has been proposed, most of them posit that this is because dark matter interacts only weakly with normal matter.

or something like that
What if dark matter is like that part of a videogame world that isn't ever created or rendered so players are never meant to get there but sometimes there's bugs and they do?
I think dark matter is the "Ether" of our age, meaning is the explanation we have just because we don't understand what's really going on yet, and we'll laugh at ourselves when we finally do figure it out.  We model it, but every time we try to find it, it's never there, so something else must be going on. 
Maybe dark matter is not the reason galaxies are staying together and not flying apart: has anyone investigated the "Cheerio effect" on a galactic scale? :-)
So basically they have no idea and are continuing to make random guesses about what Dark Matter might really be, or where. 
They look like soul eaters from azkaban.

And happy memories of our world keeps them away.

Can this be tagged with a misleading title? Because the title is very misleading. 
Dark matter has a way/reason to make random guesses about what Dark Matter is not a harebrained dream.
Scientist says huge clumps of dark matter may lie just about anywhere that we haven't pointed a dark matter detector.
I think it is a feature of an extra dimension rather than physical matter
May be a stupid question but could all the "missing matter" just be tons of supermassive black holes we can't see?
Huge pull because there is no evidence in favor of it.
As soon as we explore the dark matter, the world will really start the evolution of strange...
The real question:

Are there really Autobots and Decepticons on the moon?
Shit like this really does make me wonder about a Saturn moon matrix. Also I tripped really hard once and everything in my field of vision was moving EXCEPT Saturn 
Id much rather our industry of grant funding search for random resources in outerspace then continue searching for irreverent reasons why our planets mean temperature changes now and then, its no secret that fossil fuels play the role, why beat the dead horse over and over.

Hey, maybe there is dark mater out there or not, we can keep trying a thousand times and eventually find what we need, I just hope its not a search for more fossil fuels in outerspace because Im tired of the same old news over and over.
Just curious. What happens if a piece of this "Dark Matter", being a billion (Or gazillion) times greater than normal should happen to fall to earth? Any effect?
Dark Matter is the Luminiferous Aether of our generation...
How could anyone believe this if robots and things have already been past the moon?
Playing devils advocate here: maybe there is no dark matter or energy and its a neat way for these scientists to tie together equations that they weren't able to complete otherwise.
So Vergon 6 lies just beyond the Moon. Along with Nibbler. 

/r/futurama
DARK matter near the DARK side of the moon? Just another case of Scientists telling us what we'd already known!
"Just beyond the moon"

So how many thousands of light years away then?
Okay, ugh, look, I'm not much of a space scientist or so. But when somebody says there's a whole whooping lot of *dark* matter just beyond the moon, grant me a single small wish, yeah? Could we just leave it right there? Is that possible for humanity to just once, not try and make profit of something?
The rover is called Yùtù, or "Jade Rabbit". I've never heard it called "Bunny".
I thought that thing broke a month after it arrived?  

Edit- Just read up on it.  The "rover" doesn't actually move anymore and is basically just a webcam. But yeah, it is still there.
Who took the picture of it?
[News article](http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-10/29/c_134763460.htm)

Also, [bonus gif](http://i.imgur.com/YXKsjpz.gifv) of Bunny rolling down on the Moon!
Rabbit has been on the moon for 704 days, but immobile for 662 of those days.

Curiosity by comparison is still putting around 1186 days after landing. 

Side note - Rabbit's mission was supposed to be 3 months, Curiosity was 2 years and was extended indefinitely. 
Well yes, but it's not like there was huge competition.

There have been exactly 3 autonomous rovers on the Moon, including this one.
From wikipedia: "The rover has a dedicated, although not official, Weibo account (Jade Rabbit Lunar Rover) with over 600,000 followers, sometimes posting humorous status updates."

I would *love* if somebody would post a selected greatest hits translated into English.

Anyone know where to find pictures taken *from* this rover? I've searched recently and only can ever find pictures *of* the rover (like the one posted). I was hoping they would be high quality super HD pictures since its pretty recent and cameras have gotten so cheap.



I thought the rover died during its first Lunar night?
I'm quite surprised how so many redditors on here focus on the comparison to american technology. You guys almost seem a bit worried underneath it all... *Of course* they are still behind in R&amp;D. But in all likelihood, the chinese are going to put the next humans on the Moon and maybe the first on Mars. They've got the money and the determination. Please don't let one small chinese rover turn this subreddit into a patriotic slugfest. There's enough of that all over reddit already.


EDIT: *sigh* Lot's of people that say "they started it": That doesn't justify anything. You're just acting on the same level when you give in to these antics and create the impression that you are actually *in need* to defend yourselves. The US is the most accomplished and technologically advanced nation in spaceflight by far. This sub, just as the whole of reddit, is still dominated by american redditors and that shows heavily in these kind of threads. Stop victimizing yourselves. 
Cool rover, Bunny. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more rovers like you to go to the moon. It's what makes space great.
Funny thing the moon is now part of the south China Sea because of that thing. 
Ah yes, the jade rabbit. So well known that in the game destiny there is a [gun](http://www.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/The_Jade_Rabbit) to honor it (ps3/ps4 only). Also an [insignia](http://www.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Jade_Rabbit_Insignia).
It's operational in the same sense that the radio still works in the rusting pickup truck in the back of my neighbour's farm that's on cement blocks.
does it hop while staring at you? or is that just the japanese rovers?
Am I the only one who sees the necromomicon face from Evil Dead on it (bottom right)???
Reminds me of this guy from Wallace and Grommit "A Grand Day Out"

Well duh. Technology has only advanced for DECADES and nobody has made any serious attempts at revisiting the moon, so of course they "set a new record". Its cool to see them actually send a rover to the moon though, it seems to be a right of passage of sorts for global superpowers. Next stop... Proxy wars? Or is it nuclear arms race? D:
Hey, wait a minute.  I thought Chang'e 3 broke shortly after arriving, but it's still got an operational camera, apparently?  

The rover landed in the [Mare Imbrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare_Imbrium), which apparently faces the Earth.

...Do we have pictures of the recent lunar eclipse(s) from this thing?
From wikipedia: "The rover has a dedicated, although not official, Weibo account (Jade Rabbit Lunar Rover) with over 600,000 followers, sometimes posting humorous status updates."

Wait, so is that Bunny *in* the picture, or is Bunny *taking* the picture?
isn't it.. setting a new record every single second?  

overachievers :(
[Meanwhile, on Mars...](http://www.voicechronicle.com/3093-01-mars-rover-opportunity-is-suffering-from-amnesia/)
Funny thing the moon is now part of the south China Sea because of that thing. 
So in 2013 China couldn't get a fully operational drone with a camera on it to the moon, but in 1969 America got some men there and home?

Seems legit.

EDIT - come on guys, you seriously responded to what was obviously a joke. Why so serious?
It is also a world record for the longest working "Made in China" product :P
I like how people compare its short lifespan to Curiosity and Opportunity - this is the very first Rover China send anywhere and other than the USA China actually had an uncrewed Rover on the Moon.

Let's also keep in mind... it's been over 40 years since anyone landing ANYTHING on the moon... all pass by or orbiters.  Considering how MUCH technology has improved over the last 40 years, and considering everyone else pointing out that it doesn't move or analyze, etc... I think we should be considering this more of a FAIL.  I mean... Opportunity... amIright?
The moon? That's impressive. The USA have sent several rovers to Mars.
What a waste of a planet, Venus also is such a big waste, just floating in there in a scorching heat probably for the rest of its life. Especially when you know the distance and time involved to get to the nearest star system. 
I really enjoyed reading this.  Thank  you for taking the time to make it.
Butt jokes aside, why is Uranus referred to as a disc instead of a sphere?
[One column version](http://i.imgur.com/R7ooUue.jpg), if anyone finds this useful.

Edit: fixed nasty cut.
Very nice work! Thanks for giving back to the community with all your hard work!
There's a typo in the sun's basic facts. Photoshpere should be photosphere.

That being said this looks freaking awesome. 
Great work.

Core and Corona temperatures of sun has way to many significant figures and this looks wrong. Core is estimated to be 15.7 Million Kelvin. It makes no sense to convert this to C and write it out as 15,699,726.8.




I like this a lot. It's great to see Pluto and know that it's based on Pluto imagery and not an artist's impression.
It seems you omitted these due to spacing/more important facts, but

Uranus is the sky and father of Cronos/Saturn, who kills his father to assume reign over the universe and he births Zeus/Jupiter and the gods.

Pluto/Hades is the god of the underworld and of the dead.

Neptune/Poseidon is the god of water/seas and of earthquakes.

Charon is the ferryman who led the souls of the dead arose the poisonous river Styx.

Ceres/Demeter is the goddess of grain and harvests.

Vesta/Hestia is the goddess of the home and hearth.

Pallas is another name for Athena/Minerva, goddess of war, wisdom, and weaving.

Hygiea is the goddess of medicine/treatment, specifically preventative treatment.


Nice work, but with apologies for being a critic, to me the essential fact people need to know about Mars is how eccentric its orbit is. Listing the max and min distances from the sun would be a great addition.
Thank you very much for all the positive responses. I have decided to give you the psd file so you can tinker all you want. The psd and a new high quality jpg with corrected typos that you all pointed out is on google drive [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bz-0lJHL2xnxZWYyTkFUaHFTa2M&amp;usp=sharing)


Let me give a big thanks to /u/Odelay and /u/POTUS for the gold! This is a first for me.

Please upvote this comment so the link to psd is visible.
I'd like to have this printed and framed as a poster to put in my room. Does anyone have any suggestions for a website that can do this?
Awesome job, just one question -- why not include the scattered disk and Oort Cloud?
Did you use the NASA and ESA logos as a citation, or do you actually work for one of them?
Av distance to sun on Mars has a typo digit in it somewhere if someone hadn't pointed that one out but I didn't see one.
I've been looking into putting something like this as my background. Is there any way that you can improve the font?
 Couldn't you have found a nicer description for Uranus than a featureless disc?

 Kidding aside though, I really enjoyed reading this, good work! 
I enjoyed reading it.  My only suggestion would be to include a horizontal arrangement along the top to give an idea of scale, [something like this](http://www.u2142220.fsdata.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/planetstig_tychobrahe_ven.jpg).
That's a poster, not an infographic.

It needs to be a lot smaller, with more concise text.  It's an awesome poster, tho.
Thank you for this, I've just shared it with a lovely 10 year old who is being home schooled. 
I first want to say that this work is stunning. You obviously putted a lot of time and dedication in this, and it shows off. As an amateur of astronomy, and having been in some college courses on the solar system, I love it.

But while this is a really cool infographic, I don't think it works very well for educational purposes. I mean, there's big blocks of texts, numbers in scientific notation. Kepler's 2nd law and its consequences are hard to wrap your head around, 3rd law is basically a weird property with little implication...

Don't you think it's a little too heavy for the layman to understand easily. I see it more as a really cool "fact-reminder" for those who already understand those things than something to learn and educate yourself.

That being said, the pics are awesome &lt;3
Nice OP!! Please upload or give us the link to the original image. The font here is not readable! 
I don't understand how we can claim to know the masses of these bodies to such a precise degree. I'm not saying we can't, I'm saying I don't understand how and that it seems fishy.
This is a really pretty graphic--my compliments.  One thing though--you might want to have someone edit the English, then re-release the graphic.  There's a few grammatical errors, too many to recommend as something teachers could actually use.
This is super cool. The text version of crashcourse astronomy. Need more.
So I thought this was going to be a chart of what to me is fairly standard info but I was blown away by the 170k years for light to leave the core. Is this true? Is it due to gravity or is it one particle absorbing the photon then it getting shot out in a random direction to be absorbed by another, repeated until it finally drifts in one direction long enough to exit (idk if that even makes sense)?
thanks, I particularly like the info on the other planets and kuiper belt.
Awesome work.  
    
Here I am wondering if people on a PC don't click an image again to view at 100%.
Please! Add a Day:Year conversion to Mercury, like with the other planets. It's odd not having one.
i had a poster like this, with similar information, when i was a kid. It brings back a lot of fond memories. Thanks so much for this. 
I love this poster! Thank you so much for making it! One quick note on the Earth section... you say that there have been dozens of manned missions- while this is certainly true you could also say hundreds as there have currently been 309 manned space flights!
This is fantastic but there is a small mistake in Mercury.  It has an exosphere not an atmosphere.
So is the ring around Uranus only visible with infrared technology? 
Can I not read it just because I'm on a phone? Or am I doing something wrong? 
Bookmarked this, going to have to share this around. I figure I should know all this stuff already but apparently I don't.
Thank you so much. As a new astronomy enthusiast, I was in the hunt for an inforgrpahic like this. Thank you for your time and effort
I really liked the reference to the "Earth-Moon System". It underlies how vital our moon is to life on Earth. 
[deleted]
A geek after my own heart.  Thank you for sharing your passion and love with the world.  I'm sure that took some time to make but know that it was worth it.  Your work will now likely ignite the flames of exploration and the aww of reality in those that are to come.
I kinda need this in my house!  This is really neat!

I think it's awesome. As an info-graphic, I think it could be streamlined to exclude so many significant figures. Maybe put all the planetary properties in terms of Earth values only. And as a scientist, please don't mix mks and cgs. Otherwise, nicely done and thank you. 
Awesome.  One Comment:   A day on Venus is longer than its year? Should that be A day on Venus lasts longer than an Earth year?
Wow, I had no idea Ceres, Vesta, etc. were in the asteroid belt.  I just always assumed they were in the Keiper Belt.
It would help readability if the numbers aligned at the decimal point. That way, it's easier to see orders of magnitude.

For example, you have the temperatures listed for the sun left aligned so there is a 10 million digit directly above a 1000 digit directly above a 1 million digit.
Venus has always been my favorite planet ever since I was a kid.  I find it so fascinating how the planet shares so many similarities to earth yet so so drastically different.  It really makes you realize a planet is a ball of chemical reactions and we are the sum of its creation.  
Thank you for making this. Never knew Venus rotated opposite to all the other planets. The sun rises from the west and sets in the east. 
&gt; "[The Sun] will expand and turn into a red giant in about 5.4 billion years. It is calculated the Sun will become sufficiently large (enough) to engulf the inner planets, possibly including Earth." 

Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to you the biggest procrastination challenge we have yet to face.  

Seriously though, was a very nice post. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Is there a way you'd like to be credited if we share this? Do you have a website or anything you'd like linked? Assuming you don't mind if this makes the rounds on facebook :) 
God if i had that during High School Physics my life would've been so much easier.
This is awesome! I was wondering if there was any chance you re-render the image about 20% smaller? I'm trying to make a desktop wallpaper out of it, and I can almost get it to fit in 1080p (by stripping the images on the far left of every row, adjusting padding, etc), but it's just a little too big.

My idea is for my dual-monitor setup to have 3 wallpapers that rotate, and each one is 2x2 items (the first would be Sun/Mercury/Jupiter/Saturn, the second Venus/Earth/Uranus/Neptune, and the third would be the remainder).

I don't know how you created this image, so it may not be easier to render it at a slightly lower resolution. I don't want to just scale it down, because there's a lot of text, and it would not look very good.

In any event, awesome work.
I am going to print this on a plotter and put it on my wall. thanks OP!
Awesome poster. Do we really know the volume of the rocky planets out to 6 significant figures? 
Could you upload the original file somewhere like Google drive, dropbox, or mega? The jpeg compression is making the text somewhat hard to read in some places :/
This is fabulous - thanks op for making this.  I would love to print this as a poster for my son's room - do you have this as a vector file rather than a jpg?  
When it says the days on Saturn, for example, are 10 hours, is that the surface of the gas clouds or the solid core.
This is great! I suggest x-posting it to /r/education, I'm sure a lot of teachers would love to have this in their science classes.
So are you trying to make the ink in people's printers run out?

Don't think that black backgrounds will ever be printed out for educational purposes. This is a poster not a printout, or educational handout. I'd suggest changing it to white for that purpose. 
Thanks, that's a great and nice looking overview. The more educated people are, the more they are interested in space, and this will ultimately lead to more funding
Your units for luminosity are "ergs/sec".

May I ask what the hell an erg is?

SI units for luminosity is watts. 
Can I suggest adding the axis of rotation relative to their orbit? I don't know them precisely but I believe Venus has the least (being 3 degrees) and Uranus having an enormous one of about 80 or something which makes its day and night close crazy long.

But awesome work.

Edit, it's Uranus not Neptune.
Nice!

I'll be pedantic, and would suggest splitting the sun into interior (core/radiative zone/convective zone) and atmosphere, or everything above the photosphere (chromosphere + corona). You've missed the majority of its volume!

Something about its magnetic nature and the solar-cycle maybe.
Thanks for posting this! It answered a bunch of questions I had about Uranus. 
This is very nice.

Btw, Pluto's radius is ~1187 km.  That 1151 km measurement was from the mutual events in the 1980s.

This is amazing! Could I print this as a poster for my space-happy kids (and dad!)? If so, is there somewhere online that someone could recommend?
Printing up putting in sons room. Thank you SO MUCH.
Did William Herschel have a sense of humor in naming Uranus? Or was there a more logical reason?

Awesome reference guide by the way.
You should crosspost this to /r/dataisbeautiful
Great work, looks beautiful... but what about [Makemake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makemake) and [Haumea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haumea)?  Don't they deserve prominent mention too?  They are 2/3 and 1/3 the size of Pluto, respectively, and also orbit the sun in their own orbits, and Haumea even has moons.
Oh wow...this is brilliant.  My six-year-old is going to love this.

I mean, he probably won't get much out of the figures at the moment, but he's going to love reading up about each of the planets.

ELI5: how do they deal with body odor and general stink on a vessel the size of a gym locker room that has been continuously inhabited for the last 15 years?



Does the ISS smell?
I wonder how he got the Earth, the foreground and the stars exposed correctly all at the same time? I would expect the foreground and the Earth to be completely saturated. Also, how did he track long enough to avoid star trails? That's got to be a 20 plus second exposure (Added: apparently it was a 5 second exposure) even with the ISO jacked up to an insane level. 
The headline reminds me of a scene in an early Doctor Who (post revival early) where one of the characters in space for the first time looks out a window and utters, "it's so realistic!"
Would we see a "sky" like that if earth didn't have atmosphere ? ( not that bright because of the long exposure I guess )
How did he get a long exposure like that without star trails while moving that fast? I know to take a picture like this on the ground if you expose for more than 20 seconds or so you get star trails. 
It's really cool to see stars through the atmosphere like that. I've never really thought about it looking anything like that.
Am I the only one who like's a realistic design for science fiction space ship/infrastructure instead of a sleek Star Trek type of a design?
[This is from Interstellar.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VSDn1qN8s5g/maxresdefault.jpg) OP wasn't kidding.
i wonder how better you can see the stars with your eyes in space.
Is this pointing towards the center of our galaxy? 
Pretty awesome picture when you realize the "cloud" looking areas are from a ton of stars light years away. 
Would be great to know the camera setttings (ISO, exposure etc.). From that I might be able to visulalise how bright the Milky Way appears to the naked eye from the ISS.  
EDIT: I can only imagine what space looks like from all the way up there since I don't think I'll ever get a chance to go there myself.
Man takes photo of space. Photo looks like high budget film depicting space. 
Wait.. so astronauts up in space actually see these kind of amazing sights all the time? :( light pollution is ruining my nights
So much life out there. I mean there is obviously so much everything. There has to be life and forests and rivers and canyons by the billions, all of it with it's own history...amazing.
Unrelated Question: Would my phone have service on the ISS? Like, would my signal be ridiculously good since I'm above the atmosphere?

Edit: Disregard, I am not a smart fella. 
Reading the caption got me wondering what the protocol is for a death aboard the ISS. Imagine being the next astronaut to enter an eerily silent, still ISS and having to execute said protocol. 
Nine comments, yet none show up. Weird, man.

The article is light on actual information. This is the relevant bit:

&gt;“I think this has some of the most extreme chemistry that we’ve seen in a very localized area. There’s been other places where we’ve seen very strong chemistry, but in this kind of meter-square area, up until this point I don’t think we’ve seen anywhere with this much variability and this much unexpected chemistry,” Curiosity scientist Diana Blaney, with NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif, told Discovery News.

&gt;Many of the veins contain rich deposits of calcium sulfate. Others are laced with magnesium sulfate or fluorine. Levels of iron vary.
Rover finds rich mineral stew...

I bet Mark Watney is feeling pretty stupid right about now.  All that work, when all he had to do was crack open a rock and add a potato.
I don't like the wording, somewhat misleading; it alludes to *primordial ooze*. And that's not what science is about. 
As I was scrolling through on my phone, I thought it read "Mars rover finds Fraggle Rock." Upon closer inspection, I was disappointed.
*NASA reports that its exogeologists are chewing on a smorgasbord of data.*
Isn't it great when such a top notch site like Discovery.com has to use a phrase like "two finger widths" as a measurement reference for a subject that has NEVER BEEN EXPERIENCED BY ANYONE WITH FINGERS in order to describe size? Clearly their target audience can't grasp such a basic unit of measurement as the inch, or centimeter. I'm so sick of this lowest common denominator bullshit. It's an article about Mars exploration and mineral deposits' implication for liquid water for chrissakes. Anyone who can't conceptualize how big an inch is doesn't give a shit about this article. /rant
All you do is send some robots to Mars, have them look a around for a few years. And baby, you got a mineral stew going!

The lack of proofreading in that article is more astonishing than the presence of anything on Mars.
They already know there's ice inches beneath the surface and are trying to make mars look like earth
What are the ramifications of this "mineral stew"?
If they find oil we'll be sending humans there with a big ass drill within a week. 
Calcium sulphate is the hydrous evaporite mineral gypsum, it suggests that there was a comment with a big ass drill within a week.
See, the reason your Martian dinner was so expensive was because of the article, so from a spreading of knowledge point of view there's no point.
That just leaves an increased ad revenue as the important findings What's so special about these salts?
Doesn't stew have water? This is more like a crusty bowl of yesterdays stew.
I feel like I'm not going to be satisfied with any of this news until they find something significant. How about a fossil? Like a Mars Velociraptor? 
I can assure you way more people would click right on by if it wasn't possible to know until it was happening, Im glad you noticed!
Having rockhounded a little bit in Eastern Oregon, I have come to recognize rocks with similar appearance to these as places to look for agate.
"The site was not accessible to Curiosity’s drill, but in March the rover zapped 17 targets with its ChemCam laser and discovered a diverse chemical stew."

Zapped? Say what?
So basically the universe as far as we discovered it has the same stuff we do, but in different combinations ?


Curiosity is examining these veins to try and reveal the history of water with chemicals in solution, and a certain a pattern or mineral, you can infer there were certain conditions such as presence of water on Mars.
Clearly their target audience can't grasp such a dense verbose that it's prohibitive to understand, but surely inches and centimeters aren't accessible to a very small group of people.
"The site was not accessible to Curiosity’s drill, but in March the rover zapped 17 targets with its ChemCam laser and discovered a diverse chemical stew."

for it to be "Mineral Jackpot" someone must have been looking to win a *game*...

Now we know your intentions nasa..

That is great. We should go mine that. I hear it is really in Iceland, so it could not cost too much to get at it.
See, the reason your Martian dinner was so expensive was because of the Bible, wouldn't fit this picture.
So....question maybe better suited for ask Reddit, but ima just leave it here anyway. 

When they find life on Mars, because at this point it's only a matter of time, presumably some tiny microbe or something along those lines. Are all the religious folks going to pack it up, and concede defeat? Or are they going to continue to just keep spinning the same old b.s. like the oldie but goodie "the devil put the dinosaur bones there to trick us.
So difficult for me to understand scale in this image.  These dunes look like they are two inches tall.  Can anyone explain the scale I am looking at?
Referring to this image: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl-raw-images/proj/msl/redops/ods/surface/sol/01174/opgs/edr/ncam/NLB_501719594EDR_F0511102NCAM07753M_.JPG
Does anyone else just sit back and think how fricking awsome it is we are getting pictures from another fricking planet?
Back in the prime of the Spirit and Opportunity rovers, I followed the daily photo feeds. For a few weeks, Opportunity rolled through a really bizarre landscape with nearly this color and texture, but flatter and more melancholy, like the background in a surrealist painting.

Google 'Opportunity Meridiani Planum dunes' for the photos - the whole thing went down in around February 2009. The images are the most haunting pictures in the space program, at least until at backlit shot of Pluto came out a few weeks ago.
That iron meteorite is crazy. Never really though about the fact that the lack of weathering and atmosphere would allow for something like that to just sit there.
The spice must flow!

In all seriousness though the rovers never cease to amaze me.
Fuck can I just get a picture without words. I used to be one of those guys who couldn't stand pictures in books but on a mobile trying to look at a high quality image is a tedious task.
I was amazed and educated by the link to the blue sunset on Mars! Thanks for sharing
I suddenly have a whole new grasp of "low gravity, low atmosphere, low winds." It's as though every rock and every sand dune has been run over repeatedly with a feather duster, until large rocks are polished and even substantial bits of grit remain, but the surface is free of dust. 

Those unusual lines in the sand represent a lack of activity for a very long time, and each slope has been carved by *that exact pressure* of wind, which would have been fairly rare occurrences.

Life is a very tenacious thing. If there was ever native microbes on Mars - there was, wasn't there? - then we should check the sunny side of those ridges in the sand for bacteria and whatnot. That seems a likely place for any biological hanger-onners: well lit, protected from the wind, able to access whatever remnant moisture might be present at a small level in the small atmosphere that exists. 
Why are the pictures always black and white? Are you telling me that color photos are *so much more* complex and data-rich than black-and-white photos, that they can't fit them into a *robot we flew to the surface of Mars*?
holy shit are these actually color photos from the surface of mars?  
we're doing that already?
Somewhat unrelated, but I think I'll cry on the day we get a picture from Mars of Curiosity reunited with humans 
We need to just get people there already so they can just walk to a place and go yup turns out its burnt toast crumbs. 
The last photo in the slideshow shows that you can see the Moon from Mars. I never realized that because it was so big and shinny, you could actually see it with your naked eye (maybe). That is super cool.
This reminds me of the Red Desert in Afghanistan.  
https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kandahar,+Afghanistan/@31.2990338,65.4857204,12z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x3ed671baa0e28837:0x2759b21c9042aa75?hl=en
I take it that dunes on earth are created by the effect of wind and since Mars barely has an atmosphere, we don't know how they could have formed.

Is that right?
Reminds me of [home](http://www.arcticphoto.is/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/MG_8583_950Pixels.jpg) a little bit. :P
Beautiful. It looks like an ocean of sand. Besides their size, I wonder how different they are from the dunes here. Do they take longer to form due to the low atmospheric pressure? 
From the perspective of an old person, it's really cool to see pictures taken from a robot that we sent to another planet. I remember sitting on the floor at my grandparents house and watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon. I hope to see a man (or woman) walk on Mars in my lifetime.
Mars is connected to you and your life as anything you can see with low light pollution.
I made a 1920*1080 wallpaper version with the 2 available photos for my own use. Added a bit of a sepia filter, if anyone wants another version/colour/whatever, tell me:

Also, yes, it's incredibly obvious where the images merge, especially when zoomed out, I know, sorry, rushed it a bit.
Those dark parts are Spice, he who controls the Spice controls the universe! I for one welcome our new Rover Overlord. 
what's the thing on the bottom right of the pic? 
I imagine piling sand up on a planet with less gravity would produce different styles of sand dunes. Cool pic. 
"Scientists puzzled by dunes' rippled texture as Curiosity goes in for closer look"

I can totally imagine an old, faded newspaper with this header 100 years from now with someone remarking "curiosity killed the cat"


Looks like a beach party took place and they were slobs and didn't clean up after themselves the next day. 
To be fair, taking pictures of sand is basically all it has been exposed by erosion, something that barely happens on the moon blows my mind.
I wish the next mission has a 24/7 stream of the exploration.
This stuff is like crack to me. Yes its barren and almost life less, but it's Mars!! 
Looks like a beach party took place and they were slobs and didn't clean up after themselves the next day. 
Why are so many of the pictures black and white? 
FYI: All the Mars Rover pictures are in black and white.

They use [Bill Nye's Sundial](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/bill-nye/20120813-curiositys-marsdial-is-on.html) to colorize them.
Which which is about as inhabitable as inhabitable gets When I see pictures of the earth/space division is due to the naked eye.

This terrain reminds my of this classic wisecrack from reddit, ["I almost expect to see Kirk beating up a man in a rubber suit somewhere"](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2qyx9l/amazing_new_photo_from_curiosity_sol_844/)
When you look at photos of Mars there are a couple of things to keep in mind.  The first is that the dominant force reshaping the surface is wind, wind that has been blowing for **billions** of years.  The wind slowly eats away at the soft rock leaving [fantastical](http://www.unmannedspaceflight.com/index.php?s=8a0a84c28076021127c16b7916241579&amp;showtopic=7988&amp;st=720&amp;p=225805&amp;#entry225805) shapes.

The other thing that was not really fully realized until recently was that everything is covered in red dust that may be masking the real surface chemistry from orbiting spectrometers. There might a lot more clay, or even carbonates, on the surface than we realize, or at least I hope so.

I bet there are some crazy mineral crystal specimens on Mars.
The first is that the lack of activity for a very tenacious thing.
Nasa plans to send robots to mars in the 70s, which is difficult to say for many other places in the small atmosphere that exists.
Mars is so boring. It so needs a moon, to get its core molten so the gas in the crust will be released, and plants. 
Looks like a beach party took place and they were slobs and didn't clean up after themselves the next day. 
To be fair, taking pictures of sand is basically all it has done since it has gotten there.

Why are these black and white cellphone sized pictures? :(
Why are dunes so large on Mars compared to earth? 

Low gravity, paired with a high amount of particles in the atmosphere during storms, allows dunes to form larger once the storms stop as they would not collapse under their own weight as easily as they do on earth. 

Just my guess. 
The greatest part of the article: "The rover suffered a short circuit during a drilling operation in February and was side-lined until mid-March." 

I'm imagining Scruffy from Futurama bouncing along with a tool bag to fix the circuit in a space suit.
some years ago, I found some 3D photos of the surface (taken from a fly over) of Mars but up close.. with a basic cyan and magenta (or whatever colors older 3D glasses) allowed you to see it with depth ... it was amazing to know it's a real photo and not a painting or just CGI.  I was looking at something so far away. I thought that in the future, 3D TVs with a live 3D mission of Mars would be amazing.. not exactly real time (more like 10 minute delay) but you would be there with the astronauts. then I realized 3D TVs were just a novelty and pretty much don't exist anymore. Oh well.
And this is the planet we're going to colonize next? A place filled with dirts and sands?
Nasa has the technology to send robots to mars but can not install a color camera to take photos? why all the videos and photos of mars are black and white? I am seriously asking.
The poor bastard who worked his life getting into NASA has the task of making witty first person curiosity tweets
God damn.

The picture it took looking up into the sky to see the tiny dot that is Earth and the moon blows my mind.
Mars is so boring. It so needs a moon, to get its core molten so the gas in the crust will be released, and plants.

For comparison, [here's the ISS](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/693259main_jsc2012e219094_big.jpg) overlayed on top of a US Football field.

It's easy to forget the massive scale of this thing!

EDIT: /u/rajrdajr [shared](http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3tkjvo/the_iss_is_big_spot_kjell_lindgren_for_scale/cx7bfos) [this link](http://historicspacecraft.com/Diagrams/S/ISS_Size_Comparison_1200x700_RK2011.jpg) which shows the ISS to scale against MIR, SKYLAB a space shuttle and an astronaut along with some numbers

Is the astronaut in the picture? I can't find him for the life of me
Indeed! [I did a pretty extensive KSP version of the ISS](https://youtu.be/mvyvKzQOCQg), and you really only appreciate its size when you traversed the whole thing with a small Kerbal. 

Oh, and also, assembling it took *forever*.
I don't know what a Kjell Lindgren is, but I'm pretty sure I've seen one at Ikea
I Just did a presentation on the ISS in front of a mixed American and Russian grad class about U.S. Russian relations. The class has been heated this semester over Ukraine, Syria, sanctions, etc... hell ive heard some classmates talk about "hitting back" and such. Its all very scary. 

It amazed me how blown away they all were and how little most of them knew about the ISS, NASA, and Roscosmos. I know that one of the missions of the ISS was to provide inspirational outreach to the next generation, but I never thought it would be me, indirectly transmitting that inspiration to the next generation of diplomats between the two countries. Judging by the unusual amount of questions, something had been inspired in a good number of them and I could sense an attitude shift. 

Students that had previous expressed hardlined views about the other nation noticeably softened. One hardliner american was clearly enthralled by Roscosmos, Buran, Soyuz etc. He admitted that he felt a lot of pain for the buran designers that had to scuttle a decade of hard, passionate work. This is a guy who suggested shooting down russian planes that would challenge a no-fly-zone! Another Russian seemed thoroughly blown away by how well the two agencies function together, admitting that she couldnt believe how well the two got along in space despite relations. She suggested that we should send Putin and Obama up together on a soyuz. I think some of them walked away with a completely different perspective on US-Russia relations and that gives me a lot of hope moving forward. All this week classmates have come up to me, smiling, asking me random questions. Hubble, the russian moon/ american mars missions in the future,  'why Soyuz are the little spacecraft that could', "Who is this Hadfield guy and why do i suddenly love him so much?", etc. Ive been laughing it off, saying, "hey im not a scientist you know, I just keep up with it as a hobby" and retelling a little of what i know. 

Deep down inside though, it gave me a lot of hope for the future. 
also, spot the station was a hit. 
For those of you having trouble seeing the astronaut

http://imgur.com/oHh9JYC
To be honest it's actually quite a bit smaller than I thought it was
Some day we will have space stations that dwarf this and we will chuckle that this was once considered to be big.
I actually didn't realize it was that big, although I've seen other scale settings before. This for some reason clicked in my brain better.
I always liked [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doN4t5NKW-k) tour of the ISS.
The next station should be in a high, more equatorial orbit, in the gap between the van allen belts, and tasked with assembling larger spacecraft for trips to Mars, etc.
It's still difficult to accept that Kjell Lindgren* isn't Swedish. His name is far more Swedish sounding than Fuglesang, who I would call Norwegian and Danish if I didn't know he was actually Swedish.

*Edit: U to I
Is whizzing around with a jet pack like they do in the movie Gravity a thing? Or are they always tethered?

I didn't realise the scale of the ISS, I sort of knew it was growing but that's impressive. It makes me think it wont be long until a rotating section is added for false gravity.
Is whizzing around with a jet pack like they do in the movie Gravity a thing? Or are they always tethered?
Does anyone have a video of how the solar panels were transported up there, mounted and deployed?
That's a bug station. How does it not collide with other satellites orbiting space? 
Am I the only one that feels like we are way behind when looking at this picture?
Can anyone point him out?
I have a question.. Was the ISS 'launched' in its state (how much of it?) or was built up there part by part over the years? 

Am guessing the answer is somewhere in the middle?
Apparently it's the most expensive thing ever built at 100 billion dollars.
Holy crap after seeing the astronaut I was blown by how big the iss actually is 
I got to speak with Kjell at Worldcon this past year! He's a really great guy and it was so amazing getting to speak with him on the ISS!
awesome picture - one day we will see this on the internet (or how its called then) in a archive and laugh about it "hey look how small our first station was"..... if we don't blow up ourself in the meantime.

That seems about how big I thought it was.

How big do people think it is to be surprised by this?
Lego's in space: hardmode activated.

Real question: Does its' size have anything to do with the risk of colliding with particles or objects? Does it regularly get hit with small stuff and most people just don't hear about it? I've always wondered if it's just daily maintenance to have to go out and repair a solar cell due to a rock chipping it...

When is the application deadline? I majored in Accounting, do I meet the requirements?
I don't think anyone who will enter training now will have a chance to go to Mars, but they have to start at some point. Also, I don't think anyone is becoming an Astronaut for the pay.
Not gonna lie, I'm going to make an application in earnest. An in shape engineering student has a shot right?

Since /r/space deleted my original comment, after an edit, here it is again:

The [basic requirements](http://astronauts.nasa.gov/content/broch00.htm), on NASA's websites, are:

* Bachelors degree in a STEM major (engineering, biological sciences, physics, math) from an accredited institution
* Degree must be *followed* by 3 years of relevant experience or 1000 hours of *pilot-in-command* time in a *jet* aircraft (can substitute Masters Degree for 1 year of experience, Doctorate for 3 years). 
* Ability to pass a NASA long-form flight physical which includes having vision correctable to 20/20, etc. 
* Standing height must be 62 to 75 inches
* Be a US citizen

Just keep in mind that those are the *minimum* qualifications - the people recently selected have some **very** incredible resumes!

Link to article on NASA website:
https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/be-an-astronaut-nasa-seeks-explorers-for-future-space-missions
Damn, I wish this could take place in like 8 years... I'm just graduating high school, let me get my degree first! NASA please. 
I have the qualifications EXCEPT I'm 2 fucking inches short. Damn you genes!! :(
There's no way they'd ever accept me, but I quite fancy applying just for the rejection letter.
I have seen every episode of Star Trek, I'm pretty positive that I could beat the Kobayashi Maru and become the Captain Janeway of our generation. I'm ready NASA.
&gt;The agency is seeking pilots, engineers, scientists and medical doctors, 

And I am none of these things... Damn my weak math skills and slightly below average eyesight. 
I'm glad I am about to get my PPL. I wonder if they would accept my experience in aviation? I have a Bachelor of Science but its not a STEM degree 
If you don't meet this deadline. They will be hiring again in a couple years. Also other private space agency's will be hiring at any time in the future.
I'm actually surprised by how low the requirements are. Be educated, be in decent shape, be able to see, and don't be freakishly tall or short? That's it? I feel like a lot of people out there meet these criteria. Surely those who are picked are way better than this and have way more going for them than just meeting these bare minimum criteria? A few more years and I'll technically meet these requirements, and I'm not astronaut material, so there's gotta be more to it than this.
Sign me up! I'm a high school grad that plays games and watch's t.v. all day! do I get the job? 
They mentioned they are looking for medical doctors.  As someone who plans on entering medical school soon, I wonder which specializations they would need the most.  What can I do, NASA?  Tell me, and I'll do it!
any available jobs with a lower chance of survival? If it paid I'd take a "dead-end" space job. 
I'm surprised the pay is so low for astronauts. 60-100 000$ for leaving everything and risking your life to go to Mars? Shocking
Being only 17, I hope that by the time I am old enough to apply there will be more missions available. I knew it was a far hope, but if this mission had somehow been postponed long enough for me to get my degree and time in the field (Engineering/Air Force), I would be able to apply by the time we started doing missions on mars. :/
STEM degree, working on PPL, shit vision. Ugh, close but so far away.

See you in the next life, Mars.
Hopefully there will be more rounds of hires in the future, nice to know the requirements so I can properly prepare for it in the following 10 years.
Wish they had waited a few years till I graduate :( but truth is that ANY and all space exploration makes me happy, and the more that DO go, the more that WILL go.
Excellent! I signed up for the waiting list a while ago, should be close to the top by now. Can you believe it only cost me $100/month to be on the list???
And George W. Bush continues to work on the Manned Mission to Mars in his spare time.
So what schools are considered accredited enough?
I would become an astronaut for no pay. Once I have my MA in STEM I will apply ASAP. Dream job.
Does a major/PhD in computer science fulfill the degree requirement? Is CS filed under mathematics/engineering?
This is not to go to Mars, but to inspire people to go to Mars. 

"This next group of American space explorers will inspire the Mars generation"
Graduating from high school next year with a serious interest in majoring chemistry. Is there any way I could apply for them to groom me (is that the right word?) for service? 

Because I would pretty much do anything to get to space, and I honestly think I would be fine with crippling student debt if I was an astronaut. 
If you don't meet this deadline. They will be hiring again in a couple years. Also other private space agency's will be hiring at any time in the future.
I don't get this Mars crap, why not successfully do this on the moon first?
I am an aviation electrician in the navy. I do not have a degree but I am fairly intelligent and physically fit. They should definitely make exceptions to what seems like an antiquated application process. 
Nazi NASA is hiring actors!  Wtf, is this a stupid reality show script or what?  Where is Joe rogan?
Software Engineer &amp; Tinkerer/Creator....✓

Eagle Scout &amp; Firefighter....✓

Resourceful &amp; A great boost to crew morale....✓


Of course I'll apply!
hi so i'm 15 and i saw that the mars mission might take place around 2030 right? and being an astronaut is all i really want to do in life so does someone think i have time to go into engineering or physics i could be a candidate?
I think I have a decent chance of being at least considered for the job. I meet all the physical requirements, I have experience teaching college seniors astrodynamics, and I'm getting an advanced degree in aerospace engineering. My work experience is somewhat unique too. I'm getting excited just thinking about the possibility of this becoming a reality!
If you are not already a seasoned astronaut, someone do the math, would it be more probable to get to Mars by building your own spacecraft company ala SpaceX rather than applying? I'm guessing it would.
&gt;The agency will accept applications **from Dec. 14 through mid-February** and expects to announce candidates selected in mid-2017

So not only are they not "now hiring", you can't even apply until December.

Thanks OP.
Does the piloting make up for the STEM degree, or do I need both?  I will be graduating from the USAF Academy with a Bachelor's in Science (the STEM based set of core courses results in everyone getting a B.S.), but my major will likely be in Political Science (with minors in Chinese, and Nuclear Weapons).  I will likely be a pilot upon graduation, but will being a pilot in the military be enough to be competitive for applications, or will I need to switch majors?  Conversely, could I pick up a Master's and be eligible?
You also have to be comfortable masturbating in a group setting, since you will be in close quarters with a couple other people months at a time.
By the time they get the mission together it will be at the earliest (hopefully) 2030... 15 years from now, if not more. They should be looking at college and high school kids who will be in better shape for space when the mission happens and can train them starting younger rather than 25-30 year olds with experience now who will be in a physical decline at the time of the mission.
Can we just go back to the Moon first? I mean, seriously. So much to do up there, like learn how to live on another planet-like object first? I want my kids to be able to look in a high powered telescope and see something happening on the Moon. I don't want to spend billions going to Mars when the chances of people dying and us never going there is about 99%.
Man I have no college degree but I make more than the high end for this and I would still sign up without hesitation. I feel like I should go back to school.
Yeahhhh so I hope that this astronaut recruitment ramps up in a decade or so. By then I hope to have two masters in physics and aeronautical engineering and hopefully a P.hD in one or the other. Not to mention I can fly a plane if that helps but even still....
I'm pretty happy here on Earth.

Besides, I have enough trouble getting off the couch to the kitchen. I don't think I could make it all the way to Mars.
Damn, I want to apply but I'm not finished with my degree and am trans... Not that it says anywhere that trans persons can't go up, but who knows if it would be a detriment
I get motion sickness easy and I can get altitude sickness easily. Can I join?
I'm confused as to why it states the rate of pay for astronauts at the bottom of the article.

Let's be honest, a mission to Mars will be a one way trip! You don't need money there, unless there's some funky aliens selling things in US dollars.
I can see why it's his favourite. It's so awesome it looks like something from a science fiction film. 
Because of [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY1jYYhpGJM) from Smarter Every Day I now actually recognize where on the station this photo is taken (outside the "porch" and storage area on the Japanese module). 

Man, it's crazy to think their whole living space is some metal tubes stuck together traveling 17,000 mph above a massive planet full of people. 
Kerbal space programmer here- space walks terrify me. RIP Jebediah....and Valentina....and Bob.....
It's sad that we won't be able to bring the ISS safely back to Earth the way we could the Shuttles. It would be so freaking cool to be able to take a tour of the actual ISS in a museum some day.

I guess we'll just have to keep it up there and turn it into a space museum.
I'm trying to figure out what they're over. I can't tell if that's a landmass or if it's just clouds. 
Japan and the United States: two countries that were brutally murdering each other not too long ago. This picture shows how far we as a society have come.

We are subatomic ants on a little rock speeding across the black planes of space! I love it, so awesome!! It makes me feel so small .
That is scary. It really looks like a bunch of tin cans welded together.
Is there a copy of this picture in a higher resolution?
Anyone know what all that cabling is, messily running between modules?
A Taiwanese guy named Kjell Lindgren. What's going on here?
Its always pretty amazing to me that we have this 816,000 lb structure gravitating above us. Its just nice to know what we can, and what we could accomplish. 
I work in the live music industry and this reminds me of every bathroom in every venue.  Those logos are like band stickers tagging the ISS.

Are they near the Arctic or Antarctic beneath them in the photo? (Could also be clouds.)
Enough to make me nearly soil myself with both abject terror and amazement
How does one get a job working on these thing, not even in space I just want to fix rockets! Cars don't satisfy me anymore.
Check out that quality cabling job in between those two modules.
I see on the one section that Japan supplied that part of the ISS. Is there a comprehensive list of what nations supplied what modules to the ISS?
When I was a kid I never thought of being an astronaut or going in space, but lately I've been very interested. I dunno what the requirements would be. Education and physical ones. I know you have to have a perfect visual acuity, which I am missing (thanks computers) but I know laser surgery is allowed, so still some chance. I'm studying to become a surgeon, so still some time before I finish my education, a bit of work experience and then I might seriously apply. I'm sure there are a lot of people more interested than me in this who have been preparing for years, but is good to hope right? 
See, we can make this a possibility but we can't all have the same power sockets.

Well the problem is having change one to the other. Not exactly something done overnight.


when it said "close up" I thought it would be a lot closer than that...
So...where'd that damage come from?  

Is that common?
Vertigo. First involuntary instinct is to just jump off and plunge to Earth for some reason.
You can see me in this picture, I'm in the middle next to the blue elephant :)
It's so awesome that people are basically living in space and that the entire Earth can be just a background object in an image.
It's really really difficult, but for about a second I can kind of imagine myself ACTUALLY being there taking that picture. For that second, I feel bits of my anatomy tingling that probably evolved into rudiments hundreds of thousands of years ago and is now mistaken as a lumpier part of the lower spleen. God, to be an astronaut...
Beautiful picture but I would have expected better cable management from NASA....

[My uncle by marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Abbey) is the person most responsible for the existence of the ISS and yet almost no one knows of him.

i wonder if id have a fear of heights while up there on a space walk. i aint bothered being in small aircraft at all but manlifts or w/e?yep
I sure hope the Russians let the Americans design the lense covers.   
I'll admit I'm just a casual observer of space exploration, but why does it seem Russia is always heading toward the sun and the U.S. Is more concerned heading away from it.
I dont know why, but I find it so hard to look at a picture of venus with no atmosphere. After a few seconds I have to look away in a sort of fear. Anyone else experience something like this or am I alone here?
I thought I saw something about it earlier, do you have any other links or info on it?

This makes me so happy! Ive always loved venus and how extreme everything is there... its long day... the temp... the pressure.... the elements... which make those few pics that one probe got before it died really creepy
The crazy thing about Venus is that it has a habitable zone in its atmosphere.

Venus is arguably more habitable than Mars.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus#Aerostat_habitats_and_floating_cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus#Aerostat_habitats_and_floating_cities)
Hopefully they'll actually build one of these Venusian rover concepts:
http://www.universetoday.com/12082/how-to-keep-a-venus-rover-cool/
http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/niac/2012_phase_I_fellows_landis.html

The second design is cool, because it's not well cool. It uses high temperature electronics, so that it functions at ambient Venusian temperatures! Of course high temperature electronics aren't that fast or small so it's more along the lines of a big RC car, just like some of the first space probes. 
"... and potentially land [briefly] on the planet [until acid desolves the spacecraft]."
Russia already has skin in the game with Venera so this is a good collaboration. I think the Venera program is underrated. Instead of trying to follow the US on surveying Mars, they took a big risk with landing something on a very hot planet and it paid off well in scientific research. 
Glad to hear of this. I find Venus a very interesting planet, and one we should be putting more effort into researching. Many questions about our own planet will be answered on Venus, such as how long Earth has left to be habitable (which is one of the most important questions we can ask). The answer to that will only be found by landing on Venus, looking at its rocks, and figuring out when it lost its oceans, if it ever had any. From there we can calculate for sure the inner limit of the habitable zone. Right now we only have estimates based on very crude atmospheric models--estimates that I am extremely skeptical of.

I guess the Russians have always felt the same way with their unusual interest in Venus.
Won't whatever they land just erode away from all the acid in the "air"?
The US government and Russia are working together and people still think WW3 is going to happen. Morons.
Wouldn't anything that lands there pretty much melt?
Landing? Wouldn't a hovering uav on the venusian sky make more sense?
They ought to get  a rover to land on Venus and survive for a year or more.

They could split up the cost now they're working together.
what i wonder is the mineral/energy wealth of venus. Even if we just steal it's solar energy to drop the temp there and try to terra-form it or at least engineer life to seed it. Would there be a benefit of producing large amounts of components on venus and refining on venus to push functional mass into our open solar system?

I'm sure a solar observatory and a few extra dishes and stuff wouldn't be too useless. Imagine emitting a concentrated beam of useable energy in a set spectrum, or just a isolated and concentrated solar EMR beam using a series of massive reflectors. basically a speed road of light/heat to the outer solar system. 


Why land? Why not long term atmospheric testing to prepare for a cloud city? Why can't I have a cloud city before I die?
So what do the landers on Venus look like today? Ash? Or just really burnt spacecraft?
Whoa holy shit to land on Venus that would be cool. But man imagine what is on that planet always intrigued me the most. Besides mars. 
What the heck do they hope to find on Venus. It's hell
1. About fucking time.
2. Landing, again? God, it is almost if we don't put a flag on the damn thing, [it doesn't counts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5KV3rzuag).
Venus is 200 million miles closer to Earth than Mars is.
I mean.. Why? Don't we already know Venus is kinda, dead? 
http://eng.autostat.ru/application/includes/uploadIMG/1109.jpg
This is what Roskosmos manager produced before he moved up in his career.
The planet's surface is roughly 457ºF (That's 236ºC for all you metric folks)

That's hot enough to melt lead.

There's no way we're landing on it. 
It's a good thing the US population has mastered the metric system 
That would be bad... landing on Venus.

Maybe let the Russians do this one on their own... they're a pretty tough bunch.
There might be an obvious answer here, but why don't we see any stars in this image?
We look blue, even from there! So fucking cool.
These images always create a deep silence inside me. It's just mind boggling how insignificant we are to the Universe, how we are just a tiny byproduct of the way the Universe works. 
Why is the moon visible from saturn, but we can barely see saturn from earth?  Saturn is some bagillions(2.6 bagillion to be precise ;-) ) of times larger than the moon, but in this picture, the earth is about as big as we see saturn.
 &gt; Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there-on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
Just think it took the Apollo Astronauts 3-4 days to travel that little space in between. 
It's crazy how far apart they are from one another. 
I was wondering where the Earth was for a second. That's all I have to say thank you for reading my comment.
This image triggered something in my mind. I was totally "weirded" out by the fact that I am on that planet and this was taken millions of miles away... Its nothing new to me obviously but i just had one of those moments.... 
Ok I am very sorry for not knowing this but I read every comment and cannot find the answer....

What probe took this picture??
It's the astronomical equivalent of a selfie. Which would make Saturn a selfie stick.
Why does the image appear to have a blue back round?  Is it the type of camera they used?
There might be other intelligent life that looks at our planet and think: just another star in the universe. Just like we look at stars on Earth.
Odd to think that you could fit all the other planets in our solar system in between those two dots!
I'm really curious to see what Jupiter looks like from Saturn

This is maybe the most interesting big gray image with specs on it :D. I love how different the earth and moon look. It's also a good reminder of just how *big* the moon is. :)
The picture you're looking at wasn't taken with the equivalent of a very sensitive low-light camera taking extremely telescopic photos of tiny pinpoints of light.
Where are crazy folk to call fake since the earth is apparently flat. It's like a cult that grows bigger each day.
What telescope and  recording equipment did you use when taking this?
Crazy to think that everybody that ever lived, and everything that ever happened to all of us is in this one tiny blue speck. 
Fingers crossed that Akatsuki makes it into orbit this time around. If the JAXA team can pull this off, it will be the first time a mission was able to recover from a planetary orbit insertion failure and make it on the second try.
[Akatsuki was launched on May 2010 but failed to insert itself successfully into the Venusian orbit due to Vapor leakage problem. Currently it is orbiting the sun](http://www.space.com/29017-japan-venus-spacecraft-akatsuki-second-chance.html)
My birthday is December 7th, and I am a huge Naruto fan. If Akatsuki is successful on my birthday my life will be complete. 
Hope everything goes well.
Orbital insertion is hard. That's why Mercury MESSENGER needed an Earth flyby, two Venus flybys, and three Mercury flybys to gain the requisite speed and velocity for entering Mercury orbit in 2011:

&gt; MESSENGER will travel more than six and a half years before it begins to orbit Mercury in March 2011. This journey includes a flyby of Earth (in August 2005), two flybys of Venus (October 2006 and June 2007) and three flybys of Mercury (January 2008, October 2008 and September 2009). Visit the Mission Design section for details on MESSENGER’s journey.

For some reason, the people who ask "Why couldn't we just fly the shuttle to the moon or Mars" don't understand that entering or leaving a planetary or lunar gravity well requires tremendous and precise delta-v. It's so energy intensive that even these tiny and light (500 kg) craft sometimes need multiple orbital slingshot maneuvers because they can't carry the propellant to do it on their own.
I wish our space programs would name it's probes after gods that our country still believes in. I'd like to see Jesus II land on one of Jupiter's moon some day. 
While I'm really rooting for their second attempt, which is awesome on it's own, I'm actually looking forward to learning more about Venus itself.
Still more surprises for 2015. Boy, what a year!
Has no one tried to enter Venus? Or is it really difficult to enter it?
Seriously? The Japanese picked December 7th as the day to "invade" Venus and there isn't a funny comment regarding their timing? You disappoint me Reddit! 
Is it really a Venus orbiter before it actually orbits Venus?
I just love how they've given both Venus and JAXA smiley faces :D
That would be a great birthday present for me!  I really hope the Japanese team is successful. 
The japanese have gotten really keen on space exploration lately. Good for them!
Hope it goes well. Would be awesome to get more info on Venus.
Will the orbiter take pics of Venus? Some HD pics of Venus for christmas would be wonderful.

And now, with more space! http://i.imgur.com/6maGxLw.jpg
Sad really , we were a space fairing race nearly 50 years ago now we are a sub orbit and a bit robot shenanigans race....l'm not suprised alot of people today don't believe we went to the moon. ....never mind aliens are supposed to have built the pyramids ...we have lost our balls....for whatever reason we had them in the past...religion. ..politics. ..whatever. ...they are gone for a while....lets hope not for too long.
This may be a stupid question but were the astronauts actually allowed to have fun and jump around or would the abrasive nature of the moon dust wear down their suits too fast?
That must have been so amazing. Sometimes I look at the moon and the simplest thought blows my mind...that the moon is a physical object in space that we can fly to and walk on. These guys actually got to do it. I wonder if they are/were ever sad that they never got to go back.
If you loved this pic, you'll love [this!](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/comments/3nf1qj/some_wallpapers_i_got_from_the_project_apollo) (I guess)
Out of curiousity, how much control did the LM pilot have over landing?  From KSP I would be scared shitless attempting to land near a giant divot like that.  
I have seen so many of these Moon landing photos.

Still I'm in awe.
So in theory there should be a meteorite in the center of every crater. If I was there I'd start diggin'! Gold mine man, people pay top notch for that shit.
What always gets me with these photos is the horizon being so close... feels like you could almost jump and see over the edge
We should go back there with modern technology, and take photos in color.
Usually when you fall over, you only have enough time to act reflexively and don't get to think about what to do until you're already on the ground.

...so it must have been a pretty weird experience to have time to think "Aw hell I guess I'm falling over now."
this is going to be exhibit A when morons question the legitimacy of the moon landing. 
I find it hilarious that these are some of the most highly trained humans in the world wearing some of the most advanced equipment ever produced, and here they are just spazzing out on the moon.
This humors me.

But seriously, is that not a major design flaw of an astronaut's suit if it's tough to get up after falling?
This just goes to show, even the professionals screw up sometimes.
That being said, this is hilarious.  Thank you OP.
Those had to have been absolutely terrifying. Not only would you be stressing the hell out because your bosses *and the entire world* are watching you and you might break some million-dollar equipment, but you would also be panicking at any possible damage to your suit which could cause you to die a horrifying death in front of your family *and the entire world*. All of that happening in slow motion as you silently scream in your head.
This...was not what I expected from all those cool footages shown during history class. But hey, I bet they had a blast tripping all over the moon!

"That's one small step for man, but one giant faceplant for mankind"
These guys can't even walk and we're sending them to the moon... where do I sign up?
Honestly. I wish I could trip on the moon. Thatd be awesome.  Hit the ground where no one has hit the ground before. One giant trip for man, one giant fall for mankind .
Is it strange that I thought this was absolutely adorable? Seriously "I'm falling... aaah... ahh... ah... boop." 
Take me to your lead oh fuck ahh shit .... I'm ok I'm ok. Help me up then take me to your leader. 

This does show how restrictive the suits had to be. 
When that astronaut fell and kicked up that pile of dust from the ground it made me start to wonder what an ocean on the moon would look like... what waves would look like in low gravity, what splashing water would look like, what a shore would look like... so many questions I want answered..
IIRC Harrison Schmidt in particular kept falling. I guess as the only official geologist to land on the moon, he was looking at rock samples and not paying attention to where he was going.
this is why Neil Armstrong never dedicated more than 2 steps to humanity
"Aw look, the primates made it to their moon. Look how much fun they're having."

*meanwhile*

"Shit! Shit! Goddamn this low gravity!"
Now speed it up and add the Benny Hill Theme. The internet demands it.

That gave me so much anxiety thinking that he would never get back up.
The moon looks like fun, even without booze! For like an hour maybe...
Is it still possible for me to submit this to AFV (or maybe AFMV)? 
I wonder how the government did this, since the moon landings were shot in a film studio in California, right?
Can you imagine the fear that you'll crack the visor, or your airscrubber on your back will lock up due to getting banged up, every time you trip?
Breakdancing will really reach new levels once we colonise the moon.
I muted the song and instead played Walking on the Moon by the Police. It's actually very fitting.

We're falling on the moon,

But it's deep space gales,

What makes us flails,

And fall around like goons.

If I have learned anything in life it is that smart people are not always the most coordinated. Maybe in their work, but not their movements.
This is awesome. I cant believe ive never seen this. Crazy that the directors in Hollywood were smart enough to make an outtakes reel

So in short, Mars was very Earth-like in the past, with running water and thick atmosphere, which increases the likelihood that it might have supported life at some point.
Full text of article, since it's already loading slow for me: 

Credits: NASA/GSFC

NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission has identified the process that appears to have played a key role in the transition of the Martian climate from an early, warm and wet environment that might have supported surface life to the cold, arid planet Mars is today.

MAVEN data have enabled researchers to determine the rate at which the Martian atmosphere currently is losing gas to space via stripping by the solar wind. The findings reveal that the erosion of Mars’ atmosphere increases significantly during solar storms. The scientific results from the mission appear in the Nov. 5 issues of the journals Science and Geophysical Research Letters.

“Mars appears to have had a thick atmosphere warm enough to support liquid water which is a key ingredient and medium for life as we currently know it,” said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator for the NASA Science Mission Directorate in Washington. “Understanding what happened to the Mars atmosphere will inform our knowledge of the dynamics and evolution of any planetary atmosphere. Learning what can cause changes to a planet’s environment from one that could host microbes at the surface to one that doesn’t is important to know, and is a key question that is being addressed in NASA’s journey to Mars.”

MAVEN measurements indicate that the solar wind strips away gas at a rate of about 100 grams (equivalent to roughly 1/4 pound) every second. "Like the theft of a few coins from a cash register every day, the loss becomes significant over time," said Bruce Jakosky, MAVEN principal investigator at the University of Colorado, Boulder. "We've seen that the atmospheric erosion increases significantly during solar storms, so we think the loss rate was much higher billions of years ago when the sun was young and more active.”

In addition, a series of dramatic solar storms hit Mars’ atmosphere in March 2015, and MAVEN found that the loss was accelerated. The combination of greater loss rates and increased solar storms in the past suggests that loss of atmosphere to space was likely a major process in changing the Martian climate.

The solar wind is a stream of particles, mainly protons and electrons, flowing from the sun's atmosphere at a speed of about one million miles per hour. The magnetic field carried by the solar wind as it flows past Mars can generate an electric field, much as a turbine on Earth can be used to generate electricity. This electric field accelerates electrically charged gas atoms, called ions, in Mars’ upper atmosphere and shoots them into space.

MAVEN has been examining how solar wind and ultraviolet light strip gas from of the top of the planet's atmosphere. New results indicate that the loss is experienced in three different regions of the Red Planet: down the "tail," where the solar wind flows behind Mars, above the Martian poles in a "polar plume," and from an extended cloud of gas surrounding Mars. The science team determined that almost 75 percent of the escaping ions come from the tail region, and nearly 25 percent are from the plume region, with just a minor contribution from the extended cloud.

Ancient regions on Mars bear signs of abundant water – such as features resembling valleys carved by rivers and mineral deposits that only form in the presence of liquid water. These features have led scientists to think that billions of years ago, the atmosphere of Mars was much denser and warm enough to form rivers, lakes and perhaps even oceans of liquid water.

Recently, researchers using NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed the seasonal appearance of hydrated salts indicating briny liquid water on Mars. However, the current Martian atmosphere is far too cold and thin to support long-lived or extensive amounts of liquid water on the planet's surface.

"Solar-wind erosion is an important mechanism for atmospheric loss, and was important enough to account for significant change in the Martian climate,” said Joe Grebowsky, MAVEN project scientist from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “MAVEN also is studying other loss processes -- such as loss due to impact of ions or escape of hydrogen atoms -- and these will only increase the importance of atmospheric escape.”

The goal of NASA's MAVEN mission, launched to Mars in November 2013, is to determine how much of the planet's atmosphere and water have been lost to space. It is the first such mission devoted to understanding how the sun might have influenced atmospheric changes on the Red Planet. MAVEN has been operating at Mars for just over a year and will complete its primary science mission on Nov. 16.


Enough with the "this isn't a big deal why all the PR" crap. People who think like that are the reason NASA is underfunded. This is important science that is being done in furthering our understanding of the universe. It's not NASA's fault you all have unrealistic expectations. 
Now they're saying the loss of water happened at 3.7 billion years ago.  Interesting, almost exactly the time the earliest evidence for life on Earth is.
I'm hoping that someone sets this to "new comments" and see's this. 

What is the method of research used for this? Did they use the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to view the particles escaping the atmosphere and geological surveys done by Curiosity and the MRO to confirm ancient water?
Does this reduce the likelihood of a manned mission to Mars?

They just announced the lower limit of mass leaving the atmosphere is around 100 grams per *second*, so about 31 thousand tons per Earth year. (Again, lower limit.)  
  
Interesting.  
  
So this is going to be silly math, but lets say sometime in the future we're able to bring the Martian atmosphere to Earth-level density. Assuming the loss scales linearly to the amount of atmosphere that means we'd have to produce around 3.15 million tons of atmosphere per Earth year to account for the loss.  
  
That's a silly assumption though, I have no idea if an atmosphere 100 times denser on mars would escape faster or slower. It almost certainly wouldn't be the same rate but it's an interesting guesstimate.  
  
I'd be really curious to know what the energy cost of producing things like nitrogen and oxygen on that scale would be. Obviously if we're able to produce enough of it to increase the entire atmosphere 100-fold in the first place then accounting for the loss would be relatively trivial, but it's interesting to think about.  
  
Things I'm too lazy to look up:  
  
* What would be the total mass of the Martian atmosphere be if it was 100 times as dense but mainly composed of Nitrogen and Oxygen as it is on Earth, and what percentage of that would the yearly ~3.15 million tons of loss to solar wind amount to?  
  
* We're obviously not going to be bringing a planet's worth of atmosphere to Mars, so where on the Martian surface can we find a planetary atmosphere's worth of Nitrogen (78%) and Oxygen (21%)? I'm guessing the polar icecaps are a good bet for the latter. (From CO2 not H2O, but hey, oxygen is oxygen!)  
  
edit: Would it be fair to assume producing a quarter atmosphere's worth of Oxygen from CO2 would be like... reverse-burning that amount of coal? Carbon + Oxygen = Energy, so Energy + CO2 = Carbon and Oxygen. Sounds like a lot.  
  
Also, what are we going to do with all that Carbon?!  
  
Ah! Ship it to Earth as a Coal export. Brilliant.  
  
[cue supervillain laugh]  
  
Or we could just send a team inside a giant drill-vehicle equipped with nukes to the Martian core to start it spinning again. That could work.
So does the solar wind strip away all atmospheres including Earth's? 
ELI5 what this mean + why it's important?
[Magnetic Field and Solar Wind protection connection is not clear]( http://www.space.com/11187-earth-magnetic-field-solar-wind.html)
This is gonna be a little far fetched, but this could mean our life originated from Mars. So the atmosphere on Mars was sufficient to hold life, life exists on Mars for a hella long time, gets rocked by some celestial object, debris from mars containing life land on Earth, throw in our atmosphere and the life grows on Earth until present day. We're all fuckin' Martians, man.
100 grams / second over 3 billion years is 9.47x10^15 kilograms lost.

[Today the atmosphere of Mars has a mass of 2.5x10^16 kilograms.](http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/marsfact.html) So the atmosphere lost over 3 billion years is smaller than the current Mars atmosphere. It doesn't look like the Mars atmosphere billions of years ago was much thicker then.
How fast exactly is that rate in terms of a planets entire atmosphere?

If we could create an atmosphere on Mars over a few decades, would it be gone in just a few generations or would it take millions of years to lose it again?

It seems like a lot of this is predicated on the lack of significant magnetosphere on mars (because the core has cooled I think?). Are there any theoretical ways of re-magnetizing the planet? Heating the core up somehow? I got terraforming on my mind B) 
So, theoretically, if it were possible to deny solar winds (at some point in the far off future), would it be possible to revive the atmosphere to Earth-like conditions? Naturally the hardest hurdle would be building a large enough shield to block the whole planet in the first place. No big deal.

Article says .25 lbs / second * 60 seconds * 60 minutes * 24 hours = 21600 lbs per day.

~21600 lbs per day seems like a lot but its really almost nothing

A large (1000 MW) coal power plant produces [2lbs of CO2 per kWh](http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=74&amp;t=11) and produces 1,000,000 kW in an hour, most operate about 20 hours a day so 20,000,000 lbs of CO2 per day.

There are dozens or hundreds of coal power plants this size around the world, and each produces about 1000x times as much atmospheric gases as the martian atmosphere loses.  

NASA is excited because this basically means gases aren't really leaving the atmosphere of Mars at all at this point, which means terraforming and atmosphere creation are very feasible.
could this mean earth could also loose its atmosphere like mars did? and how come earth didn't loose its atmosphere at the same time mars did?

my question is earth is closer to the sun than mars so why wasn't earth's atmosphere stripped first? 

did mars build an atmosphere longgggg before earth and perhaps because in the past our sun was hotter, brighter mars was in the habitable zone? and now earth is in the zone and mars is too far out? If that is the case i can make a projection that in a few billion years earth will take mars spot and venus will take earth's spot in terms of the habitable zone and preform similar with the atmosphere?
Isn't the prevailing theory that this is due to Mars' core becoming solid and therefore not producing a magnetic field that would shield the atmosphere from solar winds like we have? That's what I've heard before, but if anyone has any new info in this I'd like to see it.
Back-extrapolation suggests how much atmosphere Mars used to have.  The chances that Mars once had an atmosphere much like Earth's seem much improved by knowing the rate of loss.  That has profound implications on the chances that life does or once existed there.  Having quantitative evidence that all the ingredients for Earth-like life were probably also once on Mars is good news for those of us hoping to see evidence of extraterrestrial life in our lifetimes.
Why is it a big news? I remember 4 or 5 years ago i read pretty much same article in National Geographic, where they provided graph that showed how mass of the planet and distance affect the atmosphere of the planet. And most of the article was about why Mars have such thin atmosphere. 
Was it only one solar flare that caused this effect? if so then how long did it last?
So does this mean even if we wanted to tereform mars we wouldn't be able to?
Can you imagine how fantastic it would have been if Earth and Mars were twin planets 3 billion years ago with flowing water? Its a shame it was reduced to what we see now, or we were too late to experience another planet like ours just barely out of reach.  The world would be a different place if hypothetically another race of beings were developing simultaneously.  
If the loss of atmosphere on Mars has significantly reduced compared to the past. Does this mean that Terraforming Mars would still be a possibility ?

Or would Mars still lose its atmosphere much faster than any of the theoretical terraforming approaches be able to generate it ?

So does this mean we could throw a few comets at Mars and make it habitable? 
After a little research, I found that life on earth first appeared 3.5-3.8 billion years ago. The atmosphere on Mars starting decaying 3.7 billion years ago. I know it's already a theory that life on earth may have come from Mars, but could it have started with an intelligent species fleeing that planet to ours?  
I'm confused, doesn't earth lose about 50 grams of helium alone each second?

So how could we humans boost Mars' magnetic field in order to stabilize the atmosphere for future habitation?

At this rate it would have taken 1.6324201e+12 years to strip earths atmosphere. Not accounting for formation of new atmospheric gases.

Hopefully the Multi-Trillion... (Multi-Quadrillion...?) space industry of asteroid mining will not become overpowered monopolies that dictate our entire lives... like all those titans of the past including oil, railroad, and textiles... ever increasing in complexity and need.
Some more details publicized: http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=47294
Things like this are awesome, and make me quietly wonder if the space program we see is lagging behind the secret Stargate program and they needed a bit of legal framework for some off-world mission. (/nerd)
From the bill:

&gt;‘‘A United States citizen engaged in commercial recovery of an asteroid resource or a space resource under this chapter shall be entitled to any asteroid resource or space resource obtained, including to possess, own, transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource obtained in accordance with applicable law, including the international obligations of the United States.’’.

&gt;SEC. 403. DISCLAIMER OF EXTRATERRITORIAL SOVEREIGNTY.

&gt;It is the sense of Congress that by the enactment of this Act, the United States does not thereby assert sovereignty or sovereign or exclusive rights or jurisdiction over, or the ownership of, any celestial body.

So the United States can't claim ownership of an asteroid, but the bill encourages its citizens to own it and sell it. Which, is practically U.S. ownership in some situations. This bill, to me, sounds like "go forth and take any asteroid you want because we said so and you're allowed to, because we said so. Screw what other countries think about that." Other countries aren't going to be happy.

SO STOKED!!
Okay, I've seen Alien and would prefer to not reenact it.  Pretty sure Sigourney Weaver would be on board with me,  too.  Thanks,  though. 
My father was working on a project about "mining on the moon" for NASA probably 20 years ago. It will be fun to show him this!
The best advancement would be to get us to some other planet where whatever was in HRwhatever was a matter of supreme indifference to us. 
The AI will never get off planet without space mining, so this had to happen eventually.
You know, I really think this is something a *global* government should be concerned with. Maybe it's about time we had one. With a global government these sort of legalities can be debated for the whole of humanity, not just a single world power that enjoys overstepping its boundaries. It doesn't need to even be founded for anything other than extra-terrestrial law for that matter, we can still leave the local countries to self-govern, but just like you don't have France claiming all French citizens can now stake a claim for oil in the the Arctic, we shouldn't have the US making blanket claims for space mining which is far outside our jurisdiction. 

...Not that I'm not happy with the prospect of space mining, but really the legality of this bill is going to come up sooner or later.
I don't understand, since when does America have authority over space?
and why did we need that exactly? does the US claim sovereignty over the whole of the universe?
Space exploration is going to advance at the same rate as campaign contributions from mining companies.
Because we can only exploit space if it's for a company's profit! Could be passing bills ensuring that any space exploitation is done for the common good or for public benefit, but nope. Forget about "the common heritage of mankind", it's all about the $$$.
So this supersedes the International common sense law of "Finders Keepers" ? 
I know this is kind of off topic, but anyone else know Space Mining movies? I'm thinking Alien/Aliens, Enemy Mine(hah, just realized there is a pun there), Outland, anyone know anymore?

what does mining in space have to do with US government? 
I feel like someday a poor history student will have to write an essay analyzing this bill and its effects on society.
Serious question, how does the government have any say over what is an isn't legal in space?
That treaty should of had been thrown out eons ago. It just shows you how our laws need a overhaul.

 In America you can't  even own a suppressor for fire arms without jumping through fire &amp; putting yourself on a government list, but in Europe you can buy a suppressor without any red tape.

Suppressors are seen as hearing protection &amp;  anti-nuisance devices in Europe. Suppressors were put behind red tape in Murrica because of fears of people would poach to provide for their hungry families during the great depression.
I don't think that is even the kind of thing that the US government controls

Space mining was already perfectly legal.  What this did was slow it down by infusing some bureaucracy and regulation.
Dear Nasa,

I have experience in a volunteer mine and I am crazy enough to go into space and I am pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering.

Can I work in your Space Mining Department?
**Coca-Cola^TM presents: the Moon!**

**The planet Mars, brought to you by Mars Bars.** 
Because we need the government to tell us what we can and cannot do... even in space.

Why are people so stupid to fall for this shit? We don't need the government to do ANYTHING.
It also allows for off world slaves... as it doesn't deter from using using any language as space is owned by no one. To establish tax codes, payment to employees,  and generally all around bad, why government and buisness don't mix.
Notice that these companies aren't clamoring to actually build things in space, which they would need so that they would have a use for these minerals.  More likely, they want to have free property, and be able to trade that property.   Lets build up the space-construction industry going first, and then look for raw materials in space.  Apart from experimentation, there is no reason to hurry on the mining.
How can we dictate legality of something that's not even part of planet. Wouldn't that be similar to the u.s. making mining laws in china?? What if something else has claimed this asteroid, and challenges our legal operation?? The amount of arrogance and audacity in the human species is unmatched. 
Good idea, but a quick skim makes me think it's a little too pro-business. I don't want to end up in the Borderlands universe.
I always thought that the 747 was just used to transport the shuttle back to Florida? Was this during some kind of testing?
Yes. Enterprise was experimental. It was never launched but used for several release and glide tests.

I got to see it close up as a kid. It looked like the future back then....
As a kid, I always thought the shuttle glided and landed atop the 747 in flight and then the 747 landed. I think my way is more awesome. 
The original shuttle design planned for a 'horizontal lifter' vehicle.

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/North_American_Rockwell_P333.jpg

I think it would have been pretty bad ass to have had this instead of the booster and fuel tank system. And I think it stands to mention that both shuttles were lost due directly to that "vertical lifter" system.

I have personally felt that the shuttle program was cut short of its potential because of this cost cutting measure of ditching the the 'proper' horizontal design.  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_design_process#Shuttle_design_debate 
It's as if the whole concept was literally 'stood on its head'. It's no wonder we lost two shuttles when the fundamental concept of the design was dropped to save money.

Of course the funding to create the massive and complex horizontal lifter system may simply not have been possible to acquire, but perhaps NASA might have decided to skip the shuttle for that generation instead of deciding on a 'budget' design. Perhaps we might have had an inversion where, then in the late 70's, NASA had first built on current capsule tech and had an orion-like reusable system and thus where now, in the 21st century, we would be designing our first manned, winged, reusable spacecraft.

But the past is immutable.

Hopefully after this next gen we will see the Single Stage To Orbit dreams become a reality, or maybe something better.

And although they look cool and seem right, I must admit that perhaps the very flight concept of 'wings' might simply be vestigial in regards to space flight.
I think it's funny that the NASA 747 was an American Airlines 747 and they didn't even bother to remove the logo.
I find it funny that when NASA said they were going to name the first shuttle the Constitution star trek fans wrote in to change it to the Enterprise, and NASA changed it.

2 things: the Enterprise was a Constitution class ship, so naming the first shuttle the Enterprise isn't flavorful. And the shuttle Enterprise never went to space because it was the first vehicle built and it was designed for testing.

So by throwing a fan-campaign they both missed out on being able to be accurate to lore and named the one shuttle that *didn't* achieve orbit.
Any one know why they went with an H-tail on the 737?
Does anyone know how they did this without colliding with the tail of the 747?
I remember watching this. A friend and I in high school asked a teacher to be excused from class so we could watch the first ALT.  We didn't know if the shuttle would just whip back and destroy the 747 although this kind of release-in-flight had been done many times in the past.

In the end the shuttle just floated clear of the 747 which then dove off one way while the Enterprise turned to the other.  A smooth landing followed afterwards.  We thought the future of cheap, common orbital spaceflight had arrived.

How wrong we were.
As a kid, my oldest sister was married to a engineer with NASA at EAFB Dryden Flight Test facility. He always got me passes to Enterprise related events like the first flight on the ALT and the first time it was released and landed at Edwards. I regret to say i spent more time trying to impress my first girlfriend than watching the events, and didnt keep all the NASA passes or Photographs i was given back then. 
I absolutely love how the 747 looks like a giant pile of crap.  That's real engineering right there.  The only reason to make things shiny is so that someone will think it has value, where here the true value is that it *works*.

I thought the gas giants would have looked like ten times bigger. This earth to moon comparison makes them feel a lot smaller than I thought they were.
This [video](https://youtu.be/Bz9D6xba9Og) shows the misconception people have about the distance between the moon and the earth. Pretty interesting.
Anyone else in a conflict with their mind over this?

Scientifically it looks right, but it just *feels* wrong. 
I saw a lot of people making this claim, so I tried to test it. And... yes. Yes you can. This image was done using the semi-major axis distance of the moon (~384,400km), but even at its perigee of ~363,396km, if you turn Jupiter on its side like I did with Saturn, [you can still fit all the planets AND Pluto](http://i.imgur.com/qsjMEqJ.png).
I'm a huge space geek and always have been, but this is one thing I've just never been able to comprehend. Those gas giants are absolutely gigantic, not to mention you throw in the other inner planets. 

It makes it seem like the other planets are small, like, if I just casually thought of that, I'd say the moon would barely be visible. Maybe the moon itself is just a lot bigger than I always think it is, and since it's that far away and still looks that big, it adds to its size. 

Actually I think I just solved my own problem from that. 
Can someone shove this in a simulator and show what disaster would actually happen if all the planets were actual in that position?
Yet if everyone stood on each other's shoulders, it would only take 286 millions of humans to reach the moon, with an average height of 5'5" (calculated with 4'5" since we do not count the head for this human-tower).  

That is only **4%** of the population.

*What if* all the other planets did magically appeared instantaneously and simultaneously between the Earth and Moon (in the order of Mercury being closest to the Earth and Neptune closest to the Moon). 

What kind of things would happen?
Interesting. That explain why I takes so much time to get there, otherwise we would have conquered the Moon already.
Are the other planets moons as far away (proportional) as ours are? 
Although I accept this may well be possible I don't think we should attempt to do this.
How big is the sun in comparison to the distance of the earth and moon?
What would happen if you put them all together like that in real life?
Normally I'm a huge support for the establishment of a Moon base, but this realization of how truly far away the Moon has made me less hopeful of that ever happening.
Why is Saturn so egg shaped, do the rings stretch it out?
What makes this crazier is looking at that picture and realizing that we traveled all that distance in a glorified Pillsbury biscuit tin. Go us. 
everything about the moon blows my mind.

It's the perfect size to block out our sun while leaving an ominous circle.
It orbits the earth so consistently that we only ever see one side of it.
It's far enough away to fit (almost) exactly every other planet in between.

And oh yea, it orbits a planet that harbors life.
I get that the distance from the Earth to the Moon is massive, but what makes me squint about pictures like these is that it would be a remarkable coincidence if the planets fit *so snugly* between the Earth and Moon.

The universe is messy, you'd think there'd be more empty space hanging around in there.

Guys,Gals...you can get the same view almost with a weather ballon...and a camera..nasa likes to use angles that wont reveal the earth properly, and when they do take a shot, its with a fisheye lense...nasa show the ball live, im sure you can put a nice camera outside embedded in the station..better yet launch a mini stationary satellite drone with a camera or tow it...show the ball, live,no cgi, no fisheye..
The GIF is a short out-take of ESA's newest Rosetta update. The full video (worth watching) is here:

Can someone explain to me why these colliding bodies look like some kind of  kneaded erasers when colliding?
Question: If the original pieces had enough mass to force themselves into spherical shapes will 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko eventually become spherical / why isn't is spherical?

EDIT: 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko isn't large enough to become spherical due to gravity. So why does the gif assume that its constituent pieces were spherical?
Is this the joke where title is actually referencing Venus? Because I think the closest earth-size planet is Venus. Which would explain it being a Venus twin 
&gt; It takes 1.6 days for GJ 1132b to make a single trip around Gliese 1132, its parent star (which means its orbit is smaller than Mercury's). This is a bonus for astronomers because it means the planet is frequently in view. 

Actually its shadow is in view every 1.6 days. But even that is a simplification, since we cannot image the shadow, only note the dip in brightness and the associated changes in the star/planet's spectrum.
I have a strong suspicion that our current understanding of extra-solar planetary science is no more accurate than the Victorian's understanding of paleontology.
How is its mass 1.6x earths, but only has 1.2x the gravity? I always thought gravity and mass were directly correlated why the difference?
I just finished writing up a brief 400 word assignment on this planet :)

Edit: [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZDdc0g_ZSx_nWve4bbIvOCU0CpegE5BjWfxdpPi4f_Y/edit?usp=sharing) it is.Bear in mind, I'm a first year physics student and this was based on a 50 minute lecture about exoplanets.
Wow! Only 39 light years away. if we can perfect the EM drive and run it up to 10% light speed, it'll only take us 400 years to get there...
I just woke up so I'll hope everyone will forgive me but I read the title as "Closet Sized Earth Like Alien Planet Found".... "closet sized" like a place to store clothes. That thought actually inhabited my non-caffeinated brain for a good 5-10 seconds. 
But even that is a bonus for astronomers because it means the planet completing a single trip around its star?
I think the twin part is about a planet 39 light-years away.
So Earth and a radius ~1.2 times of the Earth and a radius ~1.2 times that of the Earth yields a surface gravity of ~1.2 times that of the Earth and a radius ~1.2 times that of the Earth.
But even that is a bonus for astronomers because it appears in sci-fi, doesn't mean it could ever exist.
*Only* 39 ly away. Wow, that's pretty much the interstellar neighbourhood.
This is good news for the deep space program. It is actually fairly safe as it's primary by byproduct is alpha particles which are just helium nuclei. They won't even penetrate a thick cloth. Even though it is expensive to produce, the most expensive part of getting this in a space power systems is the regulatory clearance, not the material itself.
Tl;dr 
&gt;There is no other known fuel source that can take humanity to the edge of the solar system and beyond.


&gt;world has nearly exhausted all available supplies of plutonium-238.


&gt;One pound of plutonium-238 costs about $4 million

&gt;primary fuel source used to power more than two-dozen U.S. space missions for spacecraft and planetary probes that cannot rely on solar energy.

Fun Fact: Pu-238 was also used to power pacemakers back in the 60's and 70's. There's probably a few people still alive today with a [nuclear pacemaker!](http://imgur.com/YxyBWFT)
We'll start having to use americium soon.

Kinda fitting, too, given the name... =P

Sure, it's highly dangerous and there's risk of collateral damage in handling, but it gets the job done!

"Other than exploring deep space or powering decades-long experiments on the dark side of the moon, plutonium-238 is pretty much worthless. "

Do they think that the far side of the moon is in perpetual darkness? 
How exactly does the heat of Pu238 power a space-craft? Is it a sterling engine (the heat of the Pu238 vs the vast-coldness of space) or is it some other heat-transfer technology?
Question - How hot is this stuff? Is there any data on the temperature of a fresh block vs. one that is close to 40-50 years old?
This is the most exciting news I have seen come out of the US government in a long time. Great day for NASA and deep space exploration!
Doesn't NASA already have the same radioisotope inside the generator for *Curiosity*?

So how much heat are we talking in everyday terms? Is it warm to the touch? Is it hot to stand near? Will it burn someone in the same room? Etc?
This is a relief. Plutonium is a must for exploring the outer planets, and if I recall correctly, the Mars 2020 rover was slated to receive our final RTG before  production restarted.
Can't we just get a plutonium 238 Space Modulator from Marvin the Martian? /s

"*Other than exploring deep space or powering decades-long experiments* **on the dark side of the Moon**..."

GODDAMMIT! There is no  "DARK SIDE" of the Moon!

This is good news, but the authors opining at the end is a bit negative. 
Could anyone explain to me why they don't use this stuff to power energy on earth? It may be expensive, but it seems much more efficient and better for the environment than fossil fuels.
They surely wouldn't expel nuclear fuel into our atmosphere right, it would only burn once the craft is in orbit?
I thought NASA was working on a plasma engine, that potentially can be cheaper and faster that what we're using?  If that's the case, why would we start producing 238 if it costs so much to make?
1. The picture in question is an x-ray view, not an optical one.

2. Pulsars generally do not spew jets of matter and antimatter.  The jets are primarily gamma rays, produced by the acceleration of electrons and protons in the magnetic field of the neutron star.  While there are some anti-electrons and anti-protons generated in these highly energetic environments, it would be misleading to characterize the jets in that fashion.

We even have video of the Crab Pulsar: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Crab_Lucky_video2.gif

Incredible!
Are you sure it's producing both matter and antimatter? I can't find anything online about pulsars emitting antimatter, but I've heard before that pulsars spew matter in two directions running perpendicular to the rotation of spin.(probably an extremely simplified version, but still)
[Some fantastic gifs of the pulsar out there.](https://www.tumblr.com/tagged/crab-pulsar)

Love the ripples in the cloud. 
 
I just published an article today on the Crab Pulsar and pulsars in general. If you manage to get a copy of Astronomy Ireland Magazine, it'll be there! 
Super cool. Do pulsars allways have only one spin axis?
I have no idea we had such good images of Pulsars! This seems absolutely amazing! 
It would be cool if someone posted an optical image of a pulsar since theyre only a few miles across. This is an x-ray image, still pretty cool, but I never heard of a pulsar ejecting matter/anti-matter. Its usually deadly radiation being emitted from the poles
Fun fact - even a blackhole cant pull these apart.  They can only be swallowed whole. 

Which makes me wonder... if time basically stops near the event horizon, what actually happens to a pulsar that ventures that close? Just sits there and red shifts?
The pulsar itself is still a dot in the image though.
The antimatter part is speculation. Amazing picture though...
isn't if something is creating or interacting with matter it would simultaneously be creating or interacting with antimatter? 
"The only of a few (...) that can be resolved optically" makes no sense to me. Either it's the only one that can be resolved, or it is one of a few that can be resolved, or it's the only one that can be resolved of a few (that have some other property).
Wait so is all that almost as big as the whole Crab Nebula? Damn..
As a NJ native, this is really cool to see all the roads lit up. I can see 55, 295, 95, AC Expressway. AC all lit up. You can see the Appalachian mountains. Follow 95 from North to South. 

Oh how cool it would be to see first hand.
Interesting how when you're not zoomed in you can see New York and Philly as distinct entities, but DC and Baltimore just kinda mesh together

Also what I guess is Richmond and Virginia Beach both look almost as big as Baltimore. Very interesting pic.
Is this a good representation of what we would see with our naked eye or is this a long exposure to brighten up the scene? 

Anyone have a photo that demonstrates what the earth looks like from the ISS when the sun isn't shining on it which is approximate to what we would see if looking out the window on the ISS?
Living on the Eastern Shore of MD, it is amazing to see just how large of a difference there is in population between here and the Western Shore.

I live right off the top right corner of the solar panel sticking out.
The big dark spot in South Jersey is the Pinelands, a protected pine forest. It's really cool to see how desolate it is from space. Our state has such a high population density, yet so few people live there.
Holy shit, just realized you can make out the LIE from Riverhead all the way to Queens! That, or it's 25. You can kind of see Sunrise Highway too!

I love New York. 
:( sadly New England didn't make the cut it seems.
Wow. I can see where I live (buffalo), and where my girlfriend lives (s of Baltimore) in the same photo, were about 400 miles away. I think that's pretty cool. 
Why can I not see images like this one when I use the HDEV?

Does anyone know if any kind of filter is applied to photos like this? I see this kind of thing a lot and find it hard to believe these cities are this bright at night.
What if aliens far away can see Earth but it appears to be molten and lifeless.
Ok so this is completely off topic but this picture made me realize this, it is possible that if a intelligent species were to see our planet via some sort of telescope its possible that they would assume the planet is uninhabited because all the lights could look like a planet in ruins, covered by volcanic activity etc.... 
Looks like the blackops 2 thi g at the bottom left, to show popular places where people play
We cover this planet like a plague I hate seeing these nighttime images
"NASA employees are confirmed human and have in-jokes like normal humans do."
Does anyone know what the explanation for the feature at 70-80 degrees clockwise from the top... It's obviously a valley of some sort...is it the rim of a crater illuminated from the side? I haven't heard what the pros think. Thank you
A little over a century to go before we clear the layers and uncover the mass relay. 
I still blows my mind we're even able to see a moon of Pluto. 
i love all the names they used for the Pluto system (or whatever you would call it)

its like they chose pluto like "this is where we are going to use all the badass names."
This got me going through the NH web site raw images. I found 2 high magnification pictures of Charon.

http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/Pluto-Encounter/data/pluto/level2/lor/jpeg/029918/lor_0299180415_0x630_sci_4.jpg

and

http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/soc/Pluto-Encounter/data/pluto/level2/lor/jpeg/029918/lor_0299180409_0x630_sci_6.jpg

Not very spectacular, but these may be the highest magnification pictures of Charon that exist.

I'll look for more, and edit this post if I find some.

EDIT: I found so many that I made a separate post to hold them all.

https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3rx70m/collected_high_magnification_pictures_of_plutos/

There are some really good pictures in there. Also collections of Nix, Hydra, and Styx.
Oh man this is going to really mess up the Interplanetary Fellowship when the find out that Mordor is on Charon but Mt. Doom is on Titan.
They should have named it Plateau of Gorgoroth.
Honestly, just looking at this from a hypothetical, space tourism perspective. If they do name it Mordor then it'll be one of the more popular sights to visit 
So, we can finally say that one does not simply walk into mordor.

We are living amazing times.
^^^^Regurgitating ^^^^my ^^^^comment ^^^^from ^^^^over ^^^^in ^^^^/r/tolkienfans:  
  
&gt;Well, that's funny, because Mount Doom itself is on Titan!   

&gt; 
[Astronomical naming conventions]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Charon)  are fun.   Charon's are some of my favorites.   
  
&gt; The standard for naming features on Charon that has been agreed to by the International Astronomical Union is that names based in fiction should come from:  

&gt;&gt;-Destinations and milestones of fictional space and other exploration.
&gt;-Fictional and mythological vessels of space and other exploration.
&gt;-Fictional and mythological voyagers, travellers and explorers
  
So far there's Mordor Macula, Gallifrey Macula and Vulcan Planum.   There's also a Vader Crater, among others.   

&gt;  
[And on Saturn's moon Titan, small hills or *colles* are named after Tolkien characters and mountains or *montes* are named after peaks named in his books]( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_geological_features_on_Titan).   
  
So there's a Bilbo Colles, an Arwen Colles, an Erebor Mons, a Doom Mons, Misty Montes, and many more. 


Mordor's hot and dry and filled with ash and lava. Charon... not so much. 

Morgoth had a fortress in the frozen wastes of the north during the first age in Beleriand. Therefore, Utummno is a more appropriate name.

How cold would Pluto "feel?"  I assume colder than space, since it has some degree of atmo.  Could we design a walkable suit to handle it?
could anyone explain how bright say, "mid day" on Pluto would be? compared to earth. 
I would never think I would see Pluto like this in my life time. So up close and personal. Amazing.

Is that banding due to the camera or is that actually what it looks like?
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/kR8VObj.png), doubled the size for ya.
I didn't realize NASA launched rockets from Alaska. Found a video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldZbPSzx7sk
Why are they shooting rockets off of mountain tops? Surely there's an easier option. Everything about this picture is confusing to me.
I've always wondered, why does the flight path look curved?
This actually seems easier to get in and out of than the hour long suit changing astronauts had to do with the Apollo costumes.
it weighed over 200 lbs and had a metal "hula hoop" that would allow potentially overturned astronauts to flip themselves over. 
http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/soviet-moon-suit-smithsonian

If they could find a way to dock the back of the suit to a lander, they would be able to get in and out of the lander without an airlock or significant air loss.  Just have a door that perfectly matches the contours of the backpack.
  
To exit the lander:    
1) Open the door covering the back of the suit, which is situated so that the front of the suit is already outside.  
2) Open the back of the suit.  
3) Climb in the suit.  
4) Close the back of the suit.  
5) Close the door covering the back of the suit.  
6) Undock.  
  
Walk around on the moon.
This is awesome looking--really neat inspiration for some cool 'what if' astronaut art...
Wow, that really makes spacesuits look like personal spaceships. I don't think I've ever even seen the inside of one before.
When I saw this space suit, I was amazed to see the everyday materials used in its construction. The cloth looks fairly ordinary. The brown box visible in the center of the backpack is wooden. The outer layer of the boots is leather.
they know how to build maintainable stuff :)

i heard there was a time where no-one would buy electronics without the circuit diagram so they could be fixed if needed.
I would get caught on a wire every time I tried to get in the suit. 
I don't think I've ever even seen the inside to seal the inner airlock door.
Isn't this an Orlan suit?
That's an awful lot of money sitting there, never used.
Making this suit was sort of like buying a tux before even meeting someone to marry. 
Who is this suit supposed to be for, some kind of cosmonaut?

http://imgur.com/nGGNQjb
I saw this too!  It left a green glow after the bright light disappeared. 

It looked like a helicopter searchlight through heavy fog but it's a clear night and it didn't make a sound.
It was a missile launch exercise from San Clemente military base. 

Source: my friend is in the Navy there

Edit: the colors and light are from the sun hitting the exhaust and fumes of the rocket as it left the atmosphere

Edit 2: link to local Orange County news confirming it was the launch of a Trident II missile from the nuclear submarine USS Kentucky

Oh dear, not this again. You see a post like this pop up every year... and what people will hear, AGAIN, is that it's a missile. Because that's what it is. How do people rule out the most obvious thing?
Yea i just saw this too in Riverside county. I was terrified and awestruck at seeing it. Also the greenish glow lingered for a bit after it faded.
I saw it too -- In Oakland. Left a weird greenish light in the sky afterwards. I though it was a helicopter until it vanished! Want to know what it is?? Any info?

I read that it was a intercontinental balistic missile fired by the Navy (not sure how reliable)

Just saw that too from Vallejo. Have no clue what it is. Apparently something extremely similar was seen in September in the same area. The oakland news did a report on it.
https://www.youtube.com/embed/yu7mNmqJJ10

Here's the best video I've seen so far.
Here in Temecula too. It was crazy it just flowed across the sky. My friend commented that the moon was super bright today and I replied dude, that's no Moon... 
Looks like a launch from Vandenberg AFB to me. I've seen a couple of these. To the best of my knowledge, it's dark at that time of the evening where you are on the ground, but at the altitude the rocket is at there's still some sunlight over the horizon. So you are seeing the exhaust trail of ballistic missile highlighted with sunlight.  
Had a great view of it on the way down from Big Bear. 

It started out looking like a regular meteor, with a long orange tail. This continued for at least 30 seconds, moving very slowly across the sky. Then it turned white and lit up the entire side of the mountains. 

Crazy thing though, it never fully went away. Even after the bright white light faded it continued across the sky like a satellite.  
Saw it in Vallejo CA. 40 min north of San Francisco, friends saw it in Mexico.
[Longer and better video](http://youtu.be/ZPL7mMPT9rU) from [this other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3rymiq/picture_of_the_mysterious_light_over_the_west/cwsg4to). Shows it lighting/flaring up from nothing, going for a minute, then burning out/disappearing.
Came here to post this, a vlogger I follow just uploaded it!  [Link](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yu7mNmqJJ10) in case you want to watch that. 

A lot of people in the comments said it might be a meteor, but that's not possible, right? Seemed way too slow for that! Plus it also seemed to fizz out into some sort of gas cloud for a while..
My friend sent me this, another video of it from Mexico:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_DigrOfUFk

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yu7mNmqJJ10 this is a pretty good video of it.
I don't know what it is, but i know it can somehow be traced back to Hilary Clinton. 
Ugh, Christ, I saw this through a link from /r/videos before I logged in. Surprise surprise, people *immediately* jumped to it being aliens. I went to Bad Astronomy -- you know, hoping to hear from a *real* scientist -- and it turns out my suspicions were correct: it was a missile test.

This reminds me of the Norway "spiral" that people were jumping up and down about. It's a wormhole! It's a sign from aliens! It's a black hole! IT'S ALIENS! No, it's a malfunctioning rocket.

The woo is strong with reddit. At least I know people here on /r/space can be trusted to be sensible.

Mostly.
I saw it while on the road. I took a decent length video and was borderline terrified that it was going to hit us 
Buddy of mine in Phoenix, AZ saw the same thing.. https://instagram.com/p/9zo0u-mcE9/
Apparently Edwards AFB was testing rockets? That's what I'm seeing on Twitter. that would make more sense as the trail was traveling south to north.
I saw this also. Strangest thing I've ever seen for sure. At first it looked like a plane but then the blue line and white trails appeared and quickly signaled otherwise.
Saw it too here in SoCal. Have a video of it. It was on fire for a bit and then it made a huge cloud like thing. 
If it isnt a launch from vandenburg, which is the most likely scenario, even though they dont have one "scheduled"  Vandy launches a lot of top secret NSA spy sats, so they don't exactly put those on the schedule.  Anyways, if it isnt that then it looks like a smallish piece of comet that is just grazing the earths upper atmosphere.  
Just saw this in Northern California when I was taking out the trash!!!
Orange county sheriffs dept. says it was a military test fire 
Wasn't there something like this over Texas a few nights ago?
Just saw something like this in Arizona about 30 minutes ago but the trail color was different, it was more green than blue.
In La Quinta, CA and definitely saw this tonight about 5:45 p.m.  Thought it was a helicopter.  There was this orange yellow light moving slowish towards us in the sky until there was what appeared to be a spotlight being shone through a fog.  My fiancé remarked that there must be clouds we just don't see, but it's been clear out here in the desert all day.  It lingered for a while in the same spot.  Saw a subtle green glow too, which I thought was odd.  
Apparently the Navy was testing a Trident missile. They're MIRVs made to be launched from submarines. Basically multiple nuclear warheads could be put onto the missile. The test missile wasn't armed though. 
I saw this as well,  from Riverside County.  My daughter was playing outside and called me out to look.  REALLY cool to see,  whatever it was.  The weird green-blue glow that lingered afterwards made it that much more awesome 
It was a Naval test using a laser to disintegrate a rocket in the high atmosphere.
I saw it in Sacramento right before I went into a customers house for an appointment this evening. I thought it looked weird at first but then I convinced myself that it must be a helicopter or something. But now I'm seeing people all over the state posting images of it so I don't know what to think.
I see people post similar videos of this atleast once or twice a year. It is nothing to crazy or alien-like but is actually a ballistics missiles.

Any confirmation on this? 
It's aliens building pyramids for grains storage.  Know your history!

Man, I saw this. So crazy. No way those were test fires from a military base especially since it was seen from Arizona and Nevada according to people in this thread. 
This couldn't be comet US-10 Catalina could it? COULD IT?!?!?!?
Edit: no it wasn't. It was a Taurid meteor.
Last time i saw this was in the south bay area about 2001 give or take . It created purple rings around it and a purple streak in the sky for atleast an hour . Best way i could describe it was i thought it was a helicopter search light . Totaly silent . The government made a statement as it was seen far and wide that it was a part of the star wars program that failed and missed its target . Shortly their after they called off the program ........ Or so they said.
Is this what is left after a supernova explosion?
It's got an apparent diameter of 3.7 arc minutes so it's expanded a fair bit in 443 years ... Half a second a year
How big was the star prior to this? Can anyone place an image on it for scale?
any ideas about which spectrum we're seeing in this image or if the color was artistically manipulated?
It's amazing how much this looks like some creature you would see floating around in the deep oceans.

Marine snow and all!

I can't even begin to describe the quality of his photography work. Definitely worth checking out.
Utah'n here. I go to Moab a couple times a year and each time is a different experience, always worthwhile. I recommend anyone who comes through Utah to checkout the Arches National Park since there are so many different things to see, not just the sky. (even though the night sky is one of the best parts)

Another cool place to go is "[Top of the World](http://alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/top-of-the-world)", it's a hiking/4x4 trail located about 30 miles north of Moab. Hike to the top and you'll be greeted with 3,000ft view of Fisher Valley, Onion Creek Canyon, and as far as Canyonlands and Arches National Park.

Here are few images taken by myself;

I really wish this was the kind of thing we could see when we look up into the sky.
How do you get the stars to come out like that? I can't get them anywhere near that good.
This is our star. There are many others like it, but this one is ours. Our star is our best friend. It gives us life.﻿
What are the possibilities someone knows how to turn this into a screensaver?
if your monitor doesn't support 4k resolution, you may as well watch it 1080p and save some buffer time.
this should be on netflix in the "fireplace" and "moving landscapes" section...

lovely art in motion
Source file from NASA is 234.5 GB. I wanted to download it but you have to email them and request access to any files over 720p (which is only 3.4 GB) or a super compressed 4K. 
For those who didn't notice, the video can be downloaded in several resolutions at [http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12034](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/12034).
I'm letting it buffer for 5-6 minutes, watching about 9 glorious seconds, then it's time for more buffering. Thanks AT&amp;T.﻿
As someone who suffers from astigmatism in both eyes, the font in the beginning of this video drives me nuts.
For the first time ever, I want to go buy a 4K screen. If it's that pretty in 1080, I want to see what it looks like in full resolution. 
Just got my new 40" 4K Philips display today after ordering it on Black Friday! Money well spent!
I want to display this on a monitor mounted as a permanent picture frame. Does anyone know of a Pi project or similar that would work? 

Edit found a [pi project](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Raspberry-Pi-Media-Panel-fka-Digita/?ALLSTEPS) with Xbmc but don't know how to auto run a file. I need to just switch it on and it will start? Any takers? 
Stuff like this astounds me. Not only because of the magnitude of power this thing has, but the fact that we as a race now can accomplish looking at it this way. 
If you're near Hampton, VA I recommend going and checking out the Air and Space museum there. They have the NASA Solarium as a permanent exhibit. Think this video, projected on huge screens with the sun's "noise" pumped into the room. It's amazing.
Fookin love this. Could watch it for hours, though my colleagues are now bored of me going "oh, look at how pretty this is!"
If you had a projector, this would be great to watch projected onto an entire wall.

Out of curiosity, does anyone know if the flickering quality of the video when the sun was projected in the blue part of the light spectrum has anything to do with it being a shorter wavelength of light?
The dorky depressing space music wrecks the video. Even the [Green Acres] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mbk81X6WHA4) theme music is an improvement.

This guy takes amazing photos
Holy shit, this is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I can't stop staring at it.
Incredibly beautiful. I can't even imagine what it'd feel like to be there and experience it in person. It's like scenery from another planet.
Anyone know what the white bubble looking things in the water are? 
So that's why they call it Greenland! It wasn't just a trick to get more settlers! Wait...
Amazing photo! But I just got a new cheap ASUS laptop and I Am trying to come to grips with whether or not the monitor is well calibrated for photography... the image appears to need some post processing according to my monitor, but maybe it is wrong. This looks right on my monitor, how does it look on yours?

And it doesn't end there!

Every year, NASA selects several studies to fund as part of its [Innovative Advanced Concepts](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/index.html) program, with proposals ranging from low cost "tumbleweed" rovers to Magnetic Sails and even torpor hibernation pods. Many come from small companies all across the United States, and some even come from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The only other US Agency I know that does this sort of thing is DARPA.
The claim is meaningless.  $1 spent on NASA boosts the economy by $7-14 over what time frame?  10 years?  20 years?  50 years?  The return on investment could be great or it could be horrible, all in the same statistic.
The problem I have with this:

1. The vast majority of these don't argue for manned space flight. Which is where most of the money goes to these days. 

2. Implying that NASA invented the computer mouse is pretty generous, and goes to the bigger issue -- this is mainly arguing for government funded basic research, not NASA. The fact that NASA acted as an inefficient funding mechanism for development (inefficient compared to setting up a government agency tasked with direct funding of research) doesn't seem to be a feather in NASA's cap. 

What they should be touting is the number of children who became scientists because they were inspired by NASA. That is NASAs best product by far, and for people that want to educate, it should be pushed more. 

Imagine if the graphic were "There are XXX thousand engineers and scientists that exist because of NASA, and these provide YY Billions of dollars of GDP..."

But don't make up silly very indirect and tenuous connections to products. 
I guess we haven't realized how awesome nasa and space technology is; not enough to fund them more.
I don't buy it.  It's just like the military.  They're on the cutting edge of technology, and they have big budgets, so they're often the first people to use a new type of technology.  That doesn't mean it never would have been invented though.  Especially for things like power drills and cell phone cameras where the main limitation isn't the idea but another technology, like rechargeable battery power or computer chip fabrication.  NASA's great, but its projects are very expensive if all you're looking at are spin offs.
Man, why not scalable images for mobile devices!?
Each an every one of those should be patented or owned in some fashion by the NASA. This way NASA doesn't have to beg for money every year.
So if they make all these great discoveries and projects for the greater good, why can’t I download the plans and schematics of all their projects?
This is, in fact, NOT a nutshell. I'm not angry with you OP, just... just disappointed.  
Actually taking humans to the moon would be a good spin-off. hehehe
I'm actually writing a paper on why we should fund NASA for my writing class. this is going to be very helpful. Thanks for sharing it! 
while I don't agree with the title, I think this infopraphic is a good way to garner public support for NASA. 
Oh, but you guys believe in global warming? Yeah, no, we're cutting your budget...
How does that "Texting Plants" thing work? Could somebody explain
Let's be real here; we all know that NASA filmed the moon landing in a studio with moldy cheese used as the ground. It is just an excuse to create extra taxes for "space exploration."
So they 'invented' all this stuff and don't return a massive shareholder dividend to their taxpaying shareholders?
What a rip off.
This star system is 1500 ly away. At 10Ghz, thats 420dB of path loss!! Plugging in the gain and sensitivity of the Allen telescope array used by SETI, I calculate the aliens would have to be transmitting a 1Hz bandwidth tone (!) from a 75meter dish (!!) with 10MW of RF power (!!!) pointed directly at earth at exactly the right moment (!!!!) for us to hear them.

http://www.satsig.net/seticalc.htm

This business of pointing our antennas at remote stars and expecting to overhear their radio transmissions is ludicrous given the distances and path loss. 

Do you think it's because the megastructure is a massive library and the aliens are just whispering to one another?
Maybe the aliens communicate across the vastness of space by blocking out the light from their star in particular patterns using massive shap-shifting structures in orbit around the star.

Like a sort of solar signal lamp.
Maybe they utilize some type of technology that does not require sending and recieving signals the same way we do.
I always think of this type of stuff like this : It's like we're cavemen trying to solve a linear algebra equation written on a blackboard a mile away using a dollar store telescope to see it, and a texas instruments calculator we don't know how to use to crunch the numbers.  Also, even if we stumbled accidentally upon the right answer, we don't really know what to do with it since we don't even understand linear algebra because we're cavemen.
A couple of things:

- It was/is always a long shot

- One of the answers to Fermi's Paradox (this answer was proposed by Frank Drake in class when I was taking on of his astronomy courses) is that advanced civilizations don't broadcast signals out willy-nilly.  It is inefficient and even with our civilization you see and increasing tendency to sending signals that are directed, not widely broadcast.  This also means that broadcast signals are lower strength as detection systems get more sensitive.

- The signal band we look at is one that makes sense largely because the universe is relatively quiet in that band, but that doesn't mean that anyone is broadcasting at that frequency for anything that's not aimed at a different star system.

- Other civilizations may be intentionally not broadcasting to other star systems. 

- Massive signal loss between here and there.  So, even if they are intentionally broadcasting to "us", it's likely we wouldn't hear anything with our current capacity.

- All of the initial articles said it was likely a natural, but weird, event.

That said... obviously we are looking at debris from a collapsed megastructure following the collapse of their civilization, probably as a result of civil war or alien invasion.  We aren't picking up any signals because the civilization has been knocked  back to roughly our level, or a bit lower. 
/s
All this means is that there weren't any intelligent signals (as we know them, mind you) 1000 years ago, or however many light years away the structure is
Of course it doesn't, because any species intelligent enough to build a mega structure probably will be far past the point of radio waves, especially ones strong enough to be detected from so far away 
As expected. It was a one in a million chance at best, but still a good SETI target because it's way better than the one in a quadrillion elsewhere.
I'm not a space scientist (those guys are smart).  But if I was, I wouldn't get frustrated when the general public latches onto the idea that something may be alien.  There are a lot of lonely people out there. While these people couldn't care less about new astronomical phenomena, their interest is piqued when a very fleeting moment of interstellar contact presents itself.  These moments always lead to disappointment, but at least for a brief second people are interested in something beyond this world.  This is just human nature. If current popular hypotheses are true, and humans are among the first sentient beings, we're not going to see anyone else for a long time. But in the meantime, our dreams about making contact may fuel future adventures into deeper and deeper space.
 If we would have to redesign SETI at this point in time, would we use something to detect radio signals? 

And when we could build structures like we theorize about seeing there?  
would we still try to detect/send radio signals.     

We would probably have some entanglement particle based tech but probably not detectable by radio dishes....  
 
Keep in mind the scientists are so sure there's something going on there they're going to keep trying via other methods.
Well shit, I was expecting independence day levels of a shit storm to happen
I'm still wondering about what Edward snowden said.
We'd have no idea they were there unless they were still sending early 20th century style radio signals.
Now everything is encrypted and would look like random noise.
I suppose a carrier signal?


hiding and encrypting your interstellar coms would be a smart thing

we are probably a backwaters laughing stock for advertising
Good.    That's one alien civ that does not have a 1480 plus year head start on us then.
What we consider "Intelligent" might not be to Aliens
I thought we decided that, because intelligent life would use encryption, SETIs program won't work.  Properly encrypted info doesn't have apparent structure.
You also have to consider if there was a alien mega structure they would not be using a open signal that would be audible by any one. If any thing they would be using a encrypted signal which would be unrecognizable. ~~Its really a wasted effort~~

*Edit: Well ok sure, I guess it does add to that confirmation that you wouldn't be able to make out any signal but it still doesn't prove or disprove any sentient beings existing there to begin with.
Shut up nerds, your whole "research" premise is built on an outdated notion. Stop wasting money and misleading the public. We know there won't be any "signals" and definitely not on any spectrum we know of. Fund a damn probe or telescope instead, you know, machines that actually discover stuff.
Literally? Really? I think that's a bit of a stretch. This interesting mission will certainly be probing the corona (i.e. the hot but very thin outer atmosphere) of the Sun. But in my book, in order to "literally touch the Sun" would mean that the probe brushes or even penetrates the photosphere -the region that emits a star's light and we would perceive as the surface.
"Literally" is a terrible word to use here. SPP will be more than 5-million kilometers from the solar surface at its closest. OK that is VERY close to the Sun but it is nothing close to "touching" it. I suspect the intent of the article is to convey the fact that the probe will be in the very outer reaches of the corona (and I guess "touch" the Sun the same way shooting stars touch the Earth?). 

But for the general public, all they see is a mission called "Solar Probe" and a headline saying "touch the Sun", and so everyone assumes it will make some kind of physical contact with the Sun itself. It certainly won't!
[That same year ESA will be sending it's own Solar Orbiter as well.](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter) That means we're going to learn a lot more about not only our Sun, but stars in general, seeing how this is the only star we have access to. Does anyone know if any exciting information is expected or is everything in the "oooh, didn't know that was happening" realm?
I was at a conference where they were talking about testing this guy. It's a pretty amazing little probe, as it will be swinging incredibly close to the sun, but will also use gravity assists from Venus during which Venus will eclipse the sun from the probe's view. This means it'll encounter huge temperature swings, while needing to keep the internal components at safe temperatures. If I recall correctly, during it's closest passes to the sun, the internal temperatures will be a pleasant 60 or 70ish degrees Fahrenheit. 

The solar panels have a neat [angled design](http://space.skyrocket.de/img_sat/solar-probe-plus__2.jpg) as well, folding out and in depending on how close the probe is to the sun. They can be folded up so just a tiny portion of the panel can collect light at a glancing incident angle, protecting them from being incinerated. 
Guys here is an awesome vid showing the trajectory of both proves over time!

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emkEQ1y0m80

As you can see, NASA preffers a more direct way, while ESA is doing the Rosseta-style thousands-fly-by's and ends up with an awesome orbit on both sides.

I am eaggerly waiting for this. Not because of the Sun stuff, but because maybe this time we will fucking get some high resolution real color images of Venus in all those flyby's by both probes.

Is it close enough to be visible by eye/telescope by covering sun?
"And what actually accelerates the solar wind that creates the space weather that affects us all"

Electricity accelerates the particles. It is how mankind accelerates 100% of our particles. Plasma moving in magnetic fields and electricity all go hand in hand.
I'm sure that was an interesting article, but it made me feel stupid by using a font far larger than needed.  I couldn't even fit a paragraph on my computer screen!
How does one touch the surface of an enormous self-sustaining fusion reactor?
Isn't there a magnetic corona around the sun, about a sixth of its width above the surface, which rises in temperature into the millions? And there is nothing in the universe tough enough to penetrate that invisible heat field without atomically disintegrating?
Seven Venus flybys?

Why not carry a Venus probe along with it?

It would be more costly but we would save so much time by not requiring a second trip or mission. Maybe we could work with China or Russia and have them supply the Venus probe?


I can't wait for asteroid mining so that corporations could manufacture  probes left and right for tax breaks.

https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/3t7j1q/nasa_and_johns_hopkins_are_planning_to_launch_a/
Wouldn't the Venera probe be the first manmade objects to possibly "touch the sun"? Some of them failed to initiate entry into the Venus atmosphere, is it possible one of them continued to the sun?
Pete Conrad, third man on the Moon, used his first words on the surface to win a bet and poke fun at his short stature. He had bet a reporter that NASA didn't write a script for them to say, and that they could say whatever they want. On jumping down to the surface of the Moon, Conrad said "Whoopie! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me."

Some years later, Bruce McCandless, who served as capsule communicator for Apollo 11's moonwalk, performed the first untethered spacewalk and paraphrased Conrad's words as he left the Shuttle's payload bay: "“That may have been ‘one small step’ for Neil, but it’s a heck of a big leap for me!"
Important to note that Neil first hopped down onto the base of the lander leg first (the round part at the bottom), described the soil a bit, and **then** set foot directly onto the lunar soil from there which is when he delivered his famous line.
Honest question:  why is the bottom rung so high?
I bet the low gravity helped out quite a bit. 
How durable is the foil on the lander leg? Did they run any risk of puncturing or tearing it by standing on it?

I've seen lots of space components covered in that gold foil and have always been curious just how durable it is.
unfathomable size. like really, what the fuck is the universe doing here.
I love how you can see gravitational lensing due to the massive amount of mass in that cluster. 
If pics like this don't make you believe in life on other planets then nothing will.  

Our galaxy has 10s of billions of solar systems in it, there are trillions of galaxies in the universe, more galaxies than there are grains of sand on every beach on Earth. Blows my mind.
OP's link is to the "modest" size image, which is beautiful, but [on the NASA Photojournal page](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA20054) you can get the [full-res JPEG](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/jpeg/PIA20054.jpg) or even the TIFF version.

It's amazing how many gravitationally-lensed galaxy images there are around that cluster (the concentric, bluish streaks here and there).
that is so nice. 
try to imagin how many planets there are in this little picture.
There is so many to explore out there, a billion lifes wont do the job.
the universe is such a perfect mixture of sheer geometric elegance and utter random mess.

Reality is a walking contradiction.
wow..  gravitational lensing if fucking crazy.. spooky even. this is incredible 
In the future I'm going to change my name to Hubble, then go and steal a big cluster of galaxies.  The newspaper headlines will have this exact same title!
The amazing thing to me is that most religions ignore the bigger Universe, because the very human creators of these religions were unaware.  Even proclaiming that the Earth was the epicenter of all creation.  As we got smarter and developed technologies  we have steadily disproven   almost every one of religion's explanations.   Yet, people still hold to these tenants even though they are rife with the ignorance of 2000 years ago.

Is the light in this picture being warped around the stars in the forefront?  Is that why some of the galaxies in the top of this picture seem stretched?
to think that this image which is only a few hundred pixels in width and height spans millions of light years in reality....that's pretty cray
I once watched a youtube video that showed that if you were to travel between galaxies at light speed it would basically be total blackness due to the immense distance between the galaxies.  Is that still true traveling between galaxies of a massive cluster like this?  It's just hard to believe that with the naked eye you wouldn't be able to see the galaxy you are traveling to or the galaxy you are traveling from if you are in the middle between them.
Are the bright yellow points stars in the Milky Way?
Like I've read about it. I know what galaxies are. Their unimanginable size. But when I see a picture like this my mind can literally not keep up. I cannot think at that scale. Like what.. the.. fuck..
If you google gravitational lending, this image pops up first thing as the demonstration. 

EDIT: I said lending and came here to fix it, but I'm not going to. Fuckin' gravitational lending mktherfukers 
What's the deal with the one that's super bright on the mid bottom left?
So is this picture, as well as all pictures I see on the internet of anything and everything is space, really what all of this stuff looks like? Or are there colors and stuff added to make them look like this? 
Wow, that gravitational lensing though. It's so weird to see it actually happening in real life, I'm only used to renders of black holes.
This makes me want to watch Lawnmower Man again.
It's interesting how so many industries have tried VR so many different times and different ways along the years and it's never really seemed to fully catch on. Do we know if they're still using tech like this, or what it's intended purpose was/is?

I wonder if people on the book, which is based on a webcomic.
What I want to know is why when returning from space do we need to go really really fast (17,000 mph)? Why not 200 mph and then we won't need heat shields? The explanation of bouncing off of the atmosphere makes no sense to me.

*M1 is a supernova remnant in the constellation Taurus, 6,500 light-years away*

The Crab Nebula is the remnant of a supernova that was observed to go off in 1054 by naked-eye astronomers (since the telescope hadn't been invented!). It's been suggested that the supernova appeared as a star in the sky, as bright as the planet Venus, for up to two weeks. In that time, this nebula has been constantly expanding, and is currently expanding at a rate of 1,500 kilometres per second. I think the coolest bit here is that if this image were taken 1,000 years ago, it would be just some random star field!

Crazy to think that 1000 years ago that was just another star. Then boom.
The weird part is we knew about the supernova and we knew about the Crab Nebula, but we didn't link the two together until the 1920s. The fact that it's also the first Messier object is just a coincidence.

I've watched your PixInsight vids on YouTube.  You should make more!  They really helped me when I was tinkering with PI for the first time.
I wish I could afford a nice telescope. I live in the perfect spot for star gazing. 
A lot of people hated this suit when it was selected, but I'll be honest.. it's growing on me. I wonder if the black color scheme will survive past the prototype stage.
What's up with the glowing red retro Lego spaceship looking thing on the chest?
The helmet and the thing on his back kinda reminds me of the suit in Space Engineers though. 
When are spacesuits gonna be like [Isaac Clarke](http://www.abload.de/img/tumblr_m8ss7valoi1rde42qxy.gif)
It's great - wearing black is, after all, the best way to be seen from a distance /s

Also, heat absorption.

awesome. I'm glad they didn't go with the buzz lightyear colour scheme. This one is much more badass.
Here was the website where people voted on the design:

https://jscfeatures.jsc.nasa.gov/z2/
Doesn't look as stupid as the mock up, but I still prefer the Z1. Are these suits ever going to be used though or is it just design for the sake of it?
My biggest problem?

The size. 

Surely you can create an atmosphere of 1 without being that bulky?
That looks like the bargain space suit that you'd see on the rack at Walmart.
What is the purpose of the big red T?

Tesla sponsoring the suit or is this an Elon Musk cj?
didnt' they ever see 2001? Perfect, but strange looking bug-head space suits. Like them better than this garbage can suit they picked, anyway.

This is a simulation of an *accretion flow* around Sag A^* . Of course we can not see the BH itself. It is the hot plasma around the BH which is being visualized.

It appears to have a double torus shape, with the hemispheres rotating in opposition, one clockwise the other counter-clockwise. This fits the theory of Nassim Haramein in his paper [The Origin of Spin: A Consideration of Torque and Coriolis Forces in Einstein's Field Equations and Grand Unification Theory](http://hiup.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/torque_paper.pdf)
If so what is the hot plasma around the BH itself.
So a black hole kinda looks like a flame on the top of a match?
Looks like one of the saiyan ships that vegeta flew into Namek lol. this is pretty cool nevertheless
In this image, can we see it "shooting" gamma rays at us for a second as it spins around?  If so what is the time frame we get beamed for.

So, if immediately upon publishing the theory,  a rhinoceros was launched on an elliptical course with the 3-D velocity vector magnitude of .999999999c and said rhinoceros has just returned to the watering hole/launch facility, how much time discrepancy exists between his watch and his wife's, who had been waiting for him there since he left? And how upset will Professor H be that the rhinoceros forgot the extra box of chalk?

When was it 'discovered' in these places? If you're considering time dilation, I think you have to throw simultaneity out too. 
The Curiosity team release pictures from Mars almost immediately after they are sent back from Earth. [If you want to see more images like this, here's the website!](http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=1173ML0053140040502468E01_DXXX&amp;s=1173). They release images from all the different cameras within hours of them being taken, which is pretty cool.

[For instance I just found an image similar to the one I posted, but in colour](http://mars.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?rawid=1173ML0053140040502468E01_DXXX&amp;s=1173).


This is one of those photos where I'm not sure if this was taken on the ground, or  500 feet in the air.
I'm sure every inch of Curiosity's journey across the surface is meticulously researched and planned, but... 

This seems risky. Really risky. What if it got stuck, its wheels getting bogged in the dunes?
Where is this picture from? Can't seem to find it anywhere. Did nasa release them?
That's one of the best pictures I've ever seen from Mars. Any in color?
I love this image and am always happy to see more, but ...
For the sake of accuracy, both Spirit and Opportunity (MER-A and MER-B), which landed in 2004, have visited sand dunes. Opportunity even got its wheel stuck in a sand dune! Source http://science.nasa.gov/missions/mars-rovers/ 
I'm looking forward to the day when we have close-up images of Venus and Titan dunes...

Amazing. Curiosity will be the first rover to explore an active Martian sand dune up close. The rover is heading for a stretch of sand dunes called the “Bagnold Dunes” named for Ralph Bagnold, a British military engineer who pioneered research into how winds transport sand grains in the early 20th century.
I wonder how many bros they found in lifted trucks drinking natural light.
I'm very disappointed in PBS. Opportunity was in sand dunes from before Sol 2210, 

http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/gallery/all/1/f/2210/1F324467983EFFAFENP1222L0M1.JPG

to after Sol 2269. (Edit: Actually it was a big, scary dune field they crossed to get to another, bigger crater. Sol 2180 to Sol 2311.)

Why are they allowed to land on land while SpaceX has to land on tiny barges?
video here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pillaOxGCo
The booster landing is impressive , starting at 1:45.
This is so cool! Hope there's more competition between them, Boeing, and SpaceX!
Beat me to it, but yeah, amazing! That rocket landing video is soooo slick.
As an aeronautical engineer who isn't terribly acquainted with space vehicles (but getting more interested lately), can someone tell me the advantage of landing like this under power, versus just using a parachute with some GPS guidance? Seems like a lot of dead fuel weight to carry up, which could be used to carry more payload.
From collectspace

This all depends on your definition of suborbital, apparently. SpaceX has been conducting successful VTOL tests with its Grasshopper vehicles since 2013, a point Elon Musk pointed out this morning. McDonnell Douglas' DC-X "Delta Clipper" achieved the same before SpaceX or Blue Origin. Blue Origin did succeed at safely landing the first booster that was used to launch a payload to space. Musk and Bezos disagree about the differences between landing from a suborbital versus orbital flight.
Pretty cool.  When does the Falcon 9 first stage detach for launches where recovery is intended? I'm guessing it's higher than 100km but probably not more than 400km?
What kind of price do you think a seat will go for? Got to start saving!
What is revolutionary is the technology for landing the booster.  This tech is easily scaled up for orbital boosters, and is no mean feat.  SpaceX has been repeatedly trying to demonstrate the same capability without success.  Impressive at any scale.
I hate that all the news articles are stating that Bezos beat Musk to a successful landing.  That's not completely true.  Musk's rocket only failed at attempts to land on a moving platform out on water.  Their ground tests were all successful that I can remember.

Either way, this is a great time to be alive.
Wait so Blue Origin landed a rocket before SpaceX?! 
What telescope op. What camera. 

Great shot by the way
Sometimes I wonder what human life would be like if for some evolutionary reason, our eyesight allowed us to see the night sky with as much detail as photographs like these. The details in the stars, distant galaxies in full view, individual craters on the moon, even the shape and colour and motions of the moons of other planets in our solar system. What would our science and beliefs throughout history be like?

Sorry, I'm high as fuck right now. Amazing photo!
Are you using a focal reducer? Also, what exposure and ISO and all of that? I can't get shots like this. I can't even fit the entire Pleiades in my FOV. 
Absolutely beautiful. Excellent detail of the reflection nebula as well. I can only imagine what the miky way would have looked like from where you took the photograph.
The purple one is like that one guy at a party who is going totally nuts while everybody is not drunk yet.
So does Hydra's ~11 hour day put it in the running for fastest day on a moon,  or are there other contenders? 
It's visualizations like this that really kind of take the magic out of space, in a good way. Makes me re-realize that all space is, is an *extremely* vast place with basically a bunch of rocks and gas and other matters doing quite normal things.

And then I go to a telescope to reacquire that awe, because space still is quite mind blowingly huge.

Looks more like a family holiday gathering - people circulating around trying to avoid crazy uncle Charlie.
Why is it so common for a close moon to orbit and rotate at the same rate? The closest moon here does this, and so does ours.
So what IS Hydra’s orbital period? Wikipedia only says “chaotic”, which is used for any multi-axial spin regardless of speed. If Hydra’s fast, I want to know how fast.
I forget the guys name; but there was a theory for the formation of planets which would actually involve larger chunks of matter spinning due to how they combine.  As such; Pluto could be more proto-planet then we thought.

Why is one moon rotating in a different direction than the rest?
Is there a way to harvest energy from this spinning
"May be the farthest one yet"... is there some other contender for furthest dwarf planet, besides Pluto?
It's pretty mind boggling to think that the force of gravity drops off as an inverse square of the distance, yet these objects which are so far apart still interact in a significant way. I just had an oh-shit... science moment.
What should we call it? Other than the incoherent mouthful that is V774104
[deleted]
Worst case scenario: There are three or four dozen dwarf planets of Ceres size or bigger just in the Sednoid region. This would be one of them. The probabilities pretty much require it at this point.

Best case scenario: This leads to the discovery of a Mars, Earth, or Super Earth somewhere out there.
Is this the planet X we've heard about that throws Neptune orbit off camber a little ?
You'd think they could have used one of those high-resolution New Horizons photos of Pluto in the comparison chart instead of that old yellow blob...
This isn't including certain comets which are known as Kuiper Belt objects.
Wasn't there a new dwarf planet in So Long and Thanks for All the Fish?

/r/science has the same jump on september 4, so something sitewide rather than space-centric. i'm guessing bots or some new article that brought extra 15,000 new reddit users.
This was just released a few minutes ago. **Click to zoom!** This image is just utterly incredible!

Look about two thirds up the mosaic. It looks like the snow is being blown into massive dunes. And it's so cool how the snow slumps into the deep canyons and craters. Perhaps the nitrogen ice is thicker there?

 The chaotic mountain terrain is crazier than ever. As pointed out in [the article](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/new-horizons-returns-first-best-images-of-pluto) it really does look like huge blocks of water ice all jumbled together.

The boundary between the jumbled chaos terrain and Sputnik Planum (the flat ice plains) is strikingly define. It must be a small cliff. However it looks  to me like it's the jumbled terrain that's ontop, not Sputnik Planum, as you don't see Sputnik's [glacial swirls](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/Multimedia/Science-Photos/pics/04_McKinnon_02c.jpg) like in other regions. Is it possible the jumbled terrain is a debris flow flowing onto Sputnik Planum?
First time I've seen snow mentioned in association with Pluto.  If that's what it is it looks like there are drifts thousands of feet high in places.  Also some craters with a ton of snow in them are right next to ones with very little.  Seems like craters could be aged on that basis.
New Horizons also has the color data for all of this so that it can eventually be colorized, yes?
Wow, what a fascinating terrain on that planet. 
The alien face etched into the landscape on the bottom 3 stitched frames is pretty wild!
Does anyone have a sense of scale of the peaks and troths of the nearest "mountains"? I've been a little out of the loop in regards to the pluto flyby.

Thanks!
I once read an article by Tim Maudlin somewhere in which he points out with respect to these types of projections. that what people haven't seemed to notice is that on earth, of all the billions of species that have evolved, only one has developed intelligence to the level of producing technology.  Which means that kind of intelligence is really not very useful. It's not actually, in the general case, of much evolutionary value. We tend to think, because we love to think of ourselves, human beings, as the top of the evolutionary ladder, that the intelligence we have, that makes us human beings, is the thing that all of evolution is striving toward. But what we know is that that's not true. Obviously it doesn't matter that much if you're a beetle, that you be really smart. If it were, evolution would have produced much more intelligent beetles. We have no empirical data to suggest that there's a high probability that evolution on another planet would lead to technological intelligence. There is just too much we don't know.

&gt;And it immediately leads to an interesting conclusion. If the probability of a technological species arising on a given planet in a habitable zone is greater than one in 60 billion, then another technical species has probably arisen at some point elsewhere in the Milky Way. A tantalizing thought.

Even if there were another civilization in our galaxy, that doesn't mean we can communicate with it.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/rvLSskV.jpg?1) an illustration showing about how far our own radio emissions have reached in the Milky Way. In a couple of hundred thousand years that volume will encompass the whole galaxy, but note that even if signals from our civilization reach another (or vice versa) that doesn't mean that the signals will still be detectable. The power of a signal drops off with the square of the distance covered, and everyday radio signals become indistinguishable from backround noise at surprisingly short distances (on a cosmic scale).

To even have a chance of contact we (or they) would need to have a very high-power array focused on sending a signal to the exact right place. Add to that unlikely scenario the possibility that they might not even be listening (maybe they're not yet able to, maybe they're long since extinct when the signal arrives, maybe they just don't care to listen) and the chances of us ever contacting another civilization start to look pretty slim.

There's certainly other intelligent life out there, somewhere, and it'd be *really cool* to actually contact somebody - but realistically that is almost certainly never going to happen.
So correct me if I'm wrong, but did they revise the likelihood down? Meaning it is less likely, based on current data?  According to the abstract, it seems like all they did was find a bottom threshhold value. 
&gt;This allows Frank and Sullivan to reformulate the equation from being about the number of civilizations that exist now, to being about the probability of ours being the only one that has ever existed.

It is certainly fun to speculate about life elsewhere and particularly intelligent life, but in fact, we cannot compute a probability based on a single point. The only life we know is in our solar system. That is a single instance. Until/unless we discover life elsewhere, we cannot even predict the probability that life exists elsewhere.

I hope the universe teems with life, but that is just wishful thinking. We may be the only planet in existence with life.

Wow! Pretty soon, they'll be able to extrapolate frequency from a sample size of one, and we can finally know for sure!
I believe that even if you have a good number of civilizations spread out across the universe, the chance that at least one of them will develop something that would make space travel available seems low. 

Even so, a huge amount of time would still make it probable. Mathematically it's completely possible. The question then rises if the discovery and creation of such technology requires so much effort that not many reach it, and die off before even getting to a point close to anything like that. Or maybe there is some crushing discovery about time and space, particles and waves that we don't comprehend yet - something that might change a civilization so much internally that they are rendered impossible to advance.
Or perhaps the human element comes in : to reach such a point of singularity requires one to sacrifice his "humanity", perhaps sacrifice the "subjective" part of human reality, and not many civilizations might be united enough to even try out such a feat. Yet, we don't know any other civilizations but human ones. We model everything after ourselves. 

You can make up all sorts of scenarios which might be probable. The most interesting part is that we only know carbon based life, and the importance of water for this type of life, or any life that we know of. What if there are completely different beings made up of entirely different elements? This is a reoccurring thought when searching for ET life because one day we might have an example of alien life yet not understand it's alien. To imagine, plants are somewhat aliens to us as photosynthesis is completely mind blowing, to me, that honestly feels like something that you could discover on a distant world - some life form that uses completely different ways to get the energy needed to sustain itself.

Looking through an evolutionary model, again, we only know this model applies to earth-like life. Natural selection and, even evolution might not be at work in a completely different environment, or work completely differently. What if there's a possibility that life is extremely abundant, but in non intelligent forms, or non sapient ones. Never getting out of the primitive stage. And freaks like us are hard to come by.

It's not the question if there is life out there or isn't: It's more of a question if they manage to break their perpetual cycle of focus on what's going on in the planet. Or, if they even get to become smart enough at all. The drake equation might work if we try to model after something that is subjective to our planet, but there cannot exist such a model if we have not observed any civilization other than Earth. 
Damn . Ive never seen water get chewed up and spit out by more water . 
Can someone explain what the little bubble inside the drop is? Like why it formed and behaved how it did?
Anyone know if this gif is slowed down at all?  Or does it just look that way because of the jiggly nature of microgravity?
To me it looks like the hard stream pushed some of the water out of the bubble and also got some air into the bubble. The air was spit out at the end. Maybe my eyes are just decieving me.
I think it's interesting that, 100 years ago, people nonchalantly accepted life on other planets, and even the moon, as a foregone conclusion; whereas today we would consider such a discovery earth-shaking.

Here is a rebuttal of the life on Mars idea written by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1907. 

http://people.wku.edu/charles.smith/wallace/S730.htm
That passage really rings bells, I'm sure something very similar was in my childhood favorite book "The Marvels &amp; Mysteries of Science" by  Ellison Hawks. That wasn't the book by any chance? It was published from 1939-1943.

Loved that book, still miss it today ;-)
It was Mariner IV's pictures of a crater-pocked martian surface that swung scientific opinion the other way, into believing that Mars was as dead and sterile as the Moon.  Now we're cautiously allowing that maybe, perhaps, Mars is the abode of (simple) life.
Interesting how perspectives change over time. Can you still post the link you promised in the title?
100 years ago encyclopedias ( and other educational material ) was/were largely unregulated and you can find speculation like this in other literature from the time period.
It was a reasonable interpretation of the available evidence at the time.

In a few decades we will be in a similar position with respect to some exoplanets, and be making all sorts of false hypotheses about them.  Although a precious few may turn out to actually be alive.
Shop or not, this is great!  

Now turn the picture upside down and you got yourself a fancy street-lamp!
Why is it so big? Was it taken from a huge distance?
&gt; These grooves may then be an early phase in the disintegration of Phobos into a ring of debris around Mars.

That's really cool. How long would that process take?

I don't know much about this.  Why is it "doomed"?
It's appearance is certainly going to change and eventually it's going to have all the lights and features of a big city, also- it certainly will never crash into Mars but instead will cycle between the Earth and Mars.
What are those streaks that run across the surface horizontally caused by?
Due to the effects of solar wind traveling at about 1,000,000 mph, Mars's atmosphere is constantly being stripped away, losing 100g (1/4 lbs) of atmosphere every second. As mentioned on NASA TV, that's about one lost hamburger per second. 
Does this mean that Mars is more unlikely to have harbored life than we previously thought?
This raised so many more questions for me than it answered. 

*What does this mean about life on Mars 4 billion years ago?*

*What does this mean about possible life on Mars today?*

*What does this mean for our plans to hopefully terraform the planet one day?* 

Does anyone have any legit answers to these questions for me?

so... could this happen here?! the article says mars lost it's atmosphere because it lost it's magnetic field – but doesn’t expand on how/why that happened.
Before writing pessimistic stuff, this means Mars kept its atmosphere for 800 million years. Quite enough time for life to arise. Mars formed 4.5 billion years ago
To clear up a few misconceptions:

1. Mars is not losing much air now, actually, 10x less than Earth. So this has no bearing on terraforming. The Sun was more active when it was young. I did a back of the envelope calculation and Mars will lose all the remaining atmosphere - in about 3.5 billion years. By that time Earth will be Venuslike.

2. Earth also "lost most of its CO2 dominated atmoshere" early on, because our early atmosphere was a ~100 Bar greenhouse.

3. This does not mean 3.7 billion yeara ago, Mars already had a 0.006 bar atmosphere. If it originally had a CO2 atmosphere of say 10 bars and by 3.7 bya it degraded to 0.1 bars, you can say it lost 99 percent of the atmosphere. 0.1 bars however can support liquid water up to 36 degrees Celsius. 

2. There is evidence of floods dating back to as late as 10-500 million years ago http://science.time.com/2013/03/11/the-great-and-recent-martian-flood/ so atmosphere was enough to support major amounts of at least temporary liquid water, probably erupting from underground aquifiers.

3. This timeline has been accepted for years so stop this pessimistic stuff. This is nothing new, just confirmation of what people already expected.

4. Earth lacked a magnetic field for 3/4 of its history because the core was fully liquidhttp://www.iflscience.com/physics/scientists-reveal-birth-date-earths-inner-core . So while solar wind didn't help Mars, if it lacked a magnetic field but was Earth sized it would still retain a thick atmosphere. Venus does not have a magnetic field either yet has the opposite problem.
 So is it rare for a planet to have a spinning metal core? Or is it common and and Mars is the anomaly?
The planet *does* support liquid surface water. Headline needs revision.
Why is it that Venus still has a very thick atmosphere considering that it has no magnetic field and is even closer to the Sun?
If Mars is constantly losing atmosphere, what does it mean for that planet in the long term?  Will mars end up losing all of it's atmosphere at one point? If so, what would that mean for mars and/or the plans we have for it? 
This is sad... Mars was kinda our greatest hope for finding life and cool things like that, and now because of this, what else do we have? I mean sure Europa but I mean in terms of planets, we are basically biologically alone.. Hopefully proxima or alpha centauri is within reach in the next 100 years
I'd be in favor of changing the pictures on coins of old geezers(with all due respect) to space and humanity's  great accomplishments.
The bird-into-spaceship scene is very nicely done.
Nice. I really wish they would have picked science motives instead of culture when they changed the notes here in Sweden recently.
This is a commemorative note and coin that was released on Thanksgiving Day. It is a limited release not intended for circulation.

Sorry for the potato quality of the UV security features, but I thought they were too cool to not include somehow. Can't scan in UV and had to use cheap counterfeit-detecting LEDs and a Canon Powershot.

**Coin Back:**

Top going clockwise is China's first lunar rover [Yutu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yutu_%28rover%29), launched as part of [Chang'e 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang'e_3) on 1 Dec 2013;

[Chang'e 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang'e_1) as mentioned above;

Seems like one of the Tiangongs, but it is unclear which;

[Dongfanghong I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fang_Hong_I) as mentioned above.

The woman on the left is [Zhinü](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weaver_Girl_and_the_Cowherd), and the birds at the bottom are magpies. They are from an ancient myth where Zhinü (Vega) and her lover Niulang (Altair) are separated from eachother by the Silver River (Milky Way). Once a year on the 7th day of the 7th month in the lunar calendar, magpies form a bridge that allows them to reunite.

Bottom left is the [Long March 2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_March_2F) rocket for manned spaceflight, in use since Nov 1999.

Center is the docking of [Shenzhou 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhou_9) and [Tiangong-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiangong-1) mentioned above.
Anyone know where I can buy the coin for a reasonable price online? 10 Yuan is only about $1.56 USD but I can't fund it for less than $15 on eBay. Maybe I should just wait until there are more in circulation.
Man, I wish the EU had done something similar. I could totally picture a 20€ note with Rosetta and Philae!
Love these. Will have to try to get some. It's great too that China is trying to popularise its space activities with things like this and naming competitions for the Chang'e-3 (the Yutu rover).
I have a lot of hope for China's future and their spacial development. Their interest in astrology may be weak but they will certainly benefit from off-earth manufacturing and environment management. I wonder if they may even lead the way in solar logistics in order to construct solid supply chains.

Does China have any other distinct weaknesses in their spaceflight agency?
So [turbulence] (http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/04/01/396637276/van-goghs-turbulent-mind-captured-turbulence) has the same properties on a massive scale? 


Also, [this] (http://io9.com/5947471/vincent-van-goghs-starry-night-recreated-entirely-out-of-real-galaxy-images) is pretty cool. 
Lord Rosse performed astronomical studies and discovered the spiral nature of some nebulas, today known to be spiral galaxies. Rosse's telescope *Leviathan* was the first to reveal the spiral structure of M51, a galaxy nicknamed later as the "Whirlpool Galaxy", and his drawings of it closely resemble modern photographs. He died in 1867, 22 years before Van Gogh's masterpiece was painted.
I'm curious, if it wasn't until Hubble published his work in 1929 that it was accepted that there were galaxies outside of our own, what did William Parsons think he was seeing through his telescope?
It's a very interesting mission. ~~They are currently working on rescheduling a launch time following a problem that was discovered with the rocket's upper stage. We should know more in the coming hours~~ [New launch time of 4:04 am UTC/ 11:04 pm ET](http://www.arianespace.com/news-press-release/2015/12-2-2015-VV06-launch-date.asp). /r/Arianespace is actually hosting a [launch thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arianespace/comments/3uv800/rarianespace_vega_flight_vv06_lisa_pathfinder/) with information and news about the launch for those interested. I'll be making a cross post on this sub when we get within a few hours of launch time too. Should be a good one!
So it's a UK article and I've seen the word used before, but is "boffins" essentially "technical experts" or "experts in their various fields" or is it a slight pejorative?
Can someone explain to me why gravity waves are important when they cause such small distortions in matter?

This headline reads like he owns them.  As in he lost then some where.
