##Find Your Expert#

####The goal of our projects is to match web content (news articles, blog posts, etc) with experts on that content. Specifically, we've chosen to use Reddit's massive database to find experts based on the comments that they've left.

Please watch the following video for a brief walkthrough of our project. Use the navigation bar above for a more detailed description of our work.
