<b>Conclusions:</b>

Natural Language Processing is very Difficult 

1.) It is very difficult to predict reddit comment's sucess using text based data, given that the vast majority of reddit comments will never be popular.

2.) The predictive power of all the indicators tended to be very low as well for being able to accruately determine a comment's sucess. However, best time to post on reddit is definitely in the morning 9-11 am. 

3.) However, it gets easier to predict what comments will do better when you choose specific subreddits. For example, subreddit Conservatives, or NFL is a good target for prediction. The more specfic and obscure the subreddit is, the better the predictive power using Naive Bayes Classifier.

4.) While it is hard to predict how well a comment form reddit will do, it is much simpler and easier to predict and examine how closely related a comment is to an article

What inspired us the most initally comes from Nate Silver, and his blog fivethirtyeight.com. There he has an (<a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/reddit-ngram/?keyword=doge.dog&start=20071015&end=20150831&smoothing=10">interactive web tool</a>) that tells us how reddit comments have evolved over time.


We also found related work from Stanford. They tried something slighlty differently, instead of attempting to analyze comments they wanted to analyze reddit posts themselves. They also did their project on Matlab. Their work can be found
