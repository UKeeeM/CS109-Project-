Many of us are frequent Reddit users, and so it occured to us that often times we do not neccessarily know what the best comments are on certain posts. Despite having the upvote feature in Reddit, our group wanted a more accurate way to determine the best comments. And so the goal of our project is to build an application that identifies the best comments for any article defined by the user. In order to provide the best and most relevent comments for articles that have somehow escapped the Reddit verse, we first found similar articles that are related to the identified Reddit post and from there we determined the best comments through a prediction model. Our work can be viewed through the navigation bar on top and an extension is built and can be downloaded for easier user experience.
