Wow, this is awesome news.  

I had to forgo Plotly, cause I couldn't afford it. 

Yayy, so my IPython notebooks would be so much beautiful now  :)l

PS: For using in Ipython, you do this: 
 
    iplot([{"x": [1, 2, 3], "y": [3, 1, 6]}])

If you use R, it is highly recommended to take a look at their interactive graphs package. Bit resource intensive when loading, but they are really powerful when combined with the ggplot2 package
So whats the catch?  How do they make money with this being open sourced?
This is awesome. Have been doing some of the tutorials and read through part of the how-tos.

Does anyone here know where I can get the Tensor~~Flow~~Board visualization tool?
It is mentioned in [one of the howtos](http://tensorflow.org/how_tos/summaries_and_tensorboard/index.md), but I can't find it anywhere.

EDIT: Never mind, it was included in the default installation but I simply couldn't find the script's location. I had to do
&gt; python /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/tensorboard/tensorboard.py --logdir=path/to/log-directory
Sounds a bit like theano
This is a clever idea I've always been interested in. I'll try it out later today, I'm very curious as to its effectiveness.
This seems pretty fascinating. Can you give an overview of what it does and why it's valuable?
Accuracy isn't always a useful metric for me. As such, any plans to allow for swapping in precision, recall, F1, etc?
Great personal project, but you'll get smashed if you're planning to eventually sell this as a product.  I wanted to do the same thing almost two years ago and saw that some major talent was in the space so I moved on.

DataRobot, Whatever MIT is calling their product, IBM Health

... several major players with more talent and more cash.
The big irony is that this question is asked by interviewers here and elsewhere all the time and I am sure some of these interviewers think the example for an incorrect answer given in this article is the correct answer.
I feel like I'm either too dumb to understand this question, or that I understand it perfectly. I was only a stats minor, with an Econ major plus a concentration in econometrics, so my background is fairly limited.

That being said, I still don't see what the issue is here. The article mentions that the concept and interpretation of a p-value is hard to explain in intuitive descriptions? 

So?

The math behind them makes sense, and the conclusions drawn from them make sense too. 

Someone please inform me on what I'm missing here.
