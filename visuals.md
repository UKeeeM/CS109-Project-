As we see here, the reddit comment upvotes are very much skewed to the right with most of the comments recieving few up votes. On the other hand, the article comments are a lot lest skewed than the reddit comments, and there are several peaks in the data that can be seen in the histogram. This suggests that the reddit comments and article comments are distributed quite differently when it comes to up votes.
